MICHELET'S PRIESTS, WOMEN, AND FAMILIES. </p><p>CHRISTIANITY IN ITS VARIOUS AFFECTS, FROM THE BIRTH OF CHRIST TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Translated by C. Cocks. (Longmans, 1816.) </p><p>These publications are three of a series of translations from contemporary French authors, which, on the whole, form a not unwelcome addition to our rapidly increasing stock of cheap literature. It is true that a translation can never be more than a second best vehicle for an author's thoughts, and the more abundant his excellencies, the more does he suffer from this method of presentation, - the finer the nectar, the greater the risk in transferring it from one vessel to another. But an acquaintance with foreign modes of thought, especially on the grander questions which occupy the human mind, is too important an element in the true enlightenment of a nation, to be dispensed with until all English readers shall have faculties or leisure to become linguists. These remarks apply very forcibly to the works before us. The authors suffer perhaps more than in the average degree from the translating process; but notwith-standing this disadvantage, it is well that ordinary readers should have the means of knowing what writers so influential in their own country have to say on subjects of universal interest. Still, though we can thus approve the introduction of these works to the English public, they are far from obtaining our unqualified admiration. While they exhibit much fervid eloquence, expansiveness of view, and ardour for human liberty and human progress, they are too vague and allusive to be very rich in instruction to persons less informed than their authors, and they have the fault, perhaps inevitable to works of an antagonistic character, of putting statements too broadly, and painting facts in too strong lights and shadows. Moreover, all the philosophy of the writers has not delivered them from an almost ridiculous excess of amour de la patria, which leads them to represent the French people as a sort of second chosen race, who alone have the mission to propagate, by pen and sword, the truth which is to regenerate the nations. But national egotism is the last foible on which we English must allow ourselves to be severe. </p><p>Whatever may be the reception of the above works amongst us, the friends of Jesuitism have done them the honour of showing the most vehement indignation and alarm at their tendency, while, on the other hand, their authors have been warmly supported by those who think that France and Christendom in general have reason to regret the revival of the Society of Jesus in 1814. MM. Michelet and Quinet are, as they are fond of telling their readers, brothers not only in office, but in opinion, sharing the same views so intimately and completely, that whenever the one speaks or writes, he knows himself to be expressing the mind of the other; and one of the works before us, "The Jesuits," is a visible sign of this unity, being the joint production of the two friends. It consists of two series of lectures, - the first, by M. Michelet, too declamatory and general to be suited for anything but a viva voce delivery, to an audience who shared in the excitement that produced "long interruption" of the speaker, by "applause, murmurs, and violent language." The second course, by M. Quinet, is of more intrinsic value, containing a rapid and well-marked sketch of the origin and fortunes of the Society of Jesus, the nature of its discipline and constitution, its missions, political agency, and relation to theology and philosophy. With a candid acknowledgment of the true genius and enthusiasm which gave birth to the idea of the Society in the mind of its founder, of the pure earnestness and simple faith which carried a Xavier from India to Japan, and from thence to the shores of China, compelling from the inhabitants of those strange lands the tribute of veneration for him as a holy man, - M. Quinet  shows that the system of Loyola runs counter to the grand law which God has impressed on all nature. - the production and development of life; that wherever it presides there must be moral, social, and intellectual death; its first aim being to annihilate in its agents, and consequently in those on whom they act, all spontaneity, all will. Let man become as a corpse, ut cadaver, were the death-bed words of Loyola - let him be as a staff in the hand of an old man, senis bacillus, which is taken up and cast away again at pleasure; and one of the rules in his Spiritual Exercises is equally startling: "If authority declares that what seems to you white is black, affirm it to be black."</p><p>Michelet's "Priests, Women, and Families," is more special in its object, and much more likely to be extensively read. The author selects from history and biography samples of the effects of religious direction, by which he means a spiritual superintendence over individuals of a closer and more rigid character than that of the confessor. He gives some melancholy proofs of the too undeniable fact, that women have ever been the victims and the instruments of priestly despotism, and in the latter part of the work he dilates especially on the baneful influence of the director on the peace of domestic life. There is certainly much truth very eloquently stated in the form both of facts and principles in this work of Michelet's; but we confess that to us, loving, as we do, to dwell in the serene atmosphere of admiration for mankind, its perusal has been exquisitely painful, and with all deference to the author's experience and judgement, we advise his readers to bear in mind, that there is a large amount of truth to be urged in vindication of the defendant, which Michelet, as counsel for the other party, is not to be expected to state. We have not space for many quotations, but we give the following as rather a happy illustration of the power of habit: - </p><p>"I read once in an old story what is really affecting, and very significant. It was about a woman, a wandering princess, who, after many sufferings, found for her asylum a deserted palace, in the midst of a forest. She felt happy in reposing there, and remaining some time: she went to and fro from one large empty room to another, with our meeting with any obstacle; she thought herself alone and free. All the doors were open; only at the hall-door, no one having passed through since herself, the spider had woven his web in the sun, a thin, light, and almost invisible net-work; a feeble obstacle, which the princess, who wishes at last to go out, thinks she can remove without difficulty. She raises the web; but there is another behind it, which she also raises without trouble. The second conceals a third; that she must also raise, - strange! there are four; no, five! or rather, six, - and more beyond. Alas! how will she get rid of so many? She is already tired. No matter! she perseveres; by taking breath a little she may continue. But the web continues too, and is ever renewed with a malicious obstinacy. What is she to do? She is overcome with fatigue and perspiration, her arms fall by her sides. At last, exhausted as she is, she sits down on the ground, on that insurmountable threshold; she looks mournfully at the aerial obstacle fluttering in the wind, lightly and triumphantly. Poor princess! poor fly! now you are caught! But why did you stay in that fairy dwelling, and give the spider time to spin his web?" </p><p>Too much credit cannot be given to Messrs. Longmans and Co., for the style in which these publications are got up. As regards paper, type, and form, we think them superior to any cheap issue of popular literature that has hitherto appeared, and we trust that the spirited publishers will follow up their praiseworthy commencement in this department of the public service.</p><p>ST.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1846	PRICE 4 1/2d OR 5s. PER QUARTER.</p><p>THE COMIC HISTORY OF ENGLAND. BY GILBERT A. À BECKETT; WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY LEECH--Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4--Mr. G. A. à Beckett is well known as a writer who can find matter for fun and drollery where, to others, such a discovery would appear as hopeless as the extracting of sunbeams from cucumbers. The "Comic History of England" is not likely to diminish his reputation in this line. It teems with that rich species of double entendre which not only amuses by the presentation of incongruity, but at the same time conveys sly and pungent satire. The illustrations by Leech indicate that there is as racy a wit in the artist as in the author. We recommend the work to unfortunate students with short memories, who have never been able to engrace on their mental tablets the events of English History, especially those "battles of kites and crows," as Milton called them--the struggles of the Saxon Heptarehy. We a sure them that they will not be able to forget either Mr. G. à Beckett's narrative, or Mr. Leech's graphic commentary. </p><p>POETRY AND PROSE, FROM THE NOTEBOOK OF AN ECCENTRIC: THE WISDOM OF THE CHILD. </p><p>It may not be an original idea, but never mind, if it be a true one, that the proper result of intellectual cultivation is to restore the mind to that state of wonder and interest with which it looks on everything in childhood. Then, Jesus Jacques Rousseau, couched on the grass by the side of a plant, that he might examine its structure and appearance at his ease, would have seemed to a little child so like itself in taste and feeling, that it would have lain down by him, in full confidence of entire sympathy between them, in spite of his wizard-like Armenian attire. But I will extend the parallel, and say that true wisdom, which implies a moral as well as an intellectual result, consists in a return to that purity and simplicity which characterize early youth, when its intuitions have not been perverted. It is, indeed, a similarity with a difference; for the wonder of a child at the material world is the effect of novelty, its simplicity and purity of ignorance; while the wonder of the wise man is the result of knowledge disclosing mystery, the simplicity and purity of his moral principles, the result of wide experience and hardly-attained self-conflict. A truce to your philosophers whose elevation above their fellow-beings consists is their ability to laugh at the ties which bind women and children, who have looked just so far into the principles of ethics as to be able to disconcert a simple soul that talks of vice and virtue as realities. The child which abstains from eating plums, because grandmamma forbade, is their superior in wisdom: it exercises faith and obedience to law--two of the most ennobling attributes of humanity, which these philosophers have cast off. I have little more respect for those who have reached the stage of enlightenment in which virtue is another name for prudence, who give their sanctions to a system of morals as they do to a system of Police--to prevent inconvenience to themselves, and to society, as a necessary adjunct of themselves,--who would change their morals with their climate, and become lords of a harem in a country where such a position would be a title to respect, instead of infamy.</p><p>The tree philosopher knows what these men know, but he knows something more. He, too, has "broken through the barriers of the heavens," but it has been with a more powerful telescope than theirs. He gathers his rule of conduct, not from the suggestion of appetite, not from the dictates of expediency, but from the indications of man's highest destiny, to be found in those faculties of his nature which may be justly said to be more than human, since they might belong to conditions of being far less limited than those of man. Self-renunciation, submission to law, trust, benignity, ingenuousness, rectitude,--these are the qualities we delight most to witness in the child, and these are the qualities which most dignify the men. The true philosopher, then, constructs his moral code with a view to preserve these sentiments in that state of unsullied purity and freedom of exercises which he loves to me in a child. If he were to admite that all things were lawful to him, he would add, "I will not be thought under the power of any; I will not circumscribe or bring into bondage the section of any one of my highest endowments." He feels that in submitting to the restraint of a self-impossed law, he would be presenting humanity in its grandest aspect. But it is only the highest human state at which he aims--not anything superhuman. He seeks exercise for all the minor feelings--nay, he holds that these are the only nest in which the ever aspiring eagle nature can be properly fledged and winged; but he baptizes and hallows them all with the chrism of the diviner soul within him, and regulates their indulgence by his consciousness of the degree in which they encourage or repress the impulses of his moral sentiments. He would be neither an angel, and anchronite, nor a saint; but a man in the most complete and lofty meaning of the name--a man to whom the "child is father," perhaps in more senses than the poet thought; and who is no degenerate offspring, but a development of all the features impressesed on that heaven-born parent. </p><p>REVIEW OF 'THE NEMESIS OF FAITH'. </p><p>THE COVENTRY HERAL &amp; OBSERVER. </p><p>AND GENERAL ADVERTISER FOR THE MIDLAND COUNTIES </p><p>FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1849. </p><p>LITERATURE. </p><p>[Magazines and Works intended for Review, are requested to be sent to Mr. C.

On certain red-letter days of our existence, it happens to us to discover, among the spawn of the press, a book which, as we read, seems to undergo a sort of transformation before us. We no longer hold heavily in our hands an octavo of some hundred pages, over which the eye laboriously travels, hardly able to drag along with it the restive mind; but we seem to be in companionship with a spirit, who is transfusing himself into our soulds, and so vitalizing them by his superior energy, that life, both outward and inward, presents itself to us in higher relief, in colours brightened and deepened--we seem to have been bathing in the pool of Siloam, and to have come forth seeing. The books which carry this magic in them are the true products of genius, and their influence, whether for good or evil, is to the influence of all the respectable results of mere talent and industry, as the mighty Nile to the dykes which receive and distribute its heaven-fed waters. Such a book is the Nemesis of Faith. We are sure that its author is a bright particular star, though he sometimes leaves us in doubt whether he be not a fallen "son of the morning." Much there is in the work of a questionable character; yet more which hardly falls within the scope of a newspaper editor's notice; but its trenchant remarks on some of our English conventions, its striking sketches of the dubious aspect which many chartered respectabilities are beginning to wear under the light of this nineteenth centry, its suggestive hints as to the necessity of re-casting the currency of our religion and virture, that it may carry frech and bright the stamp of the age's highest and best idea,--these have a practical bearing, which may well excite the grave, perhaps the alarmed attention of some important classes among us. We will resign the work into the hands of judges of more ability, and more unquestioned credentials, only quoting one or two passages as a slight sample for readers. Surely there is work for our augurs when a Clergyman writes thus of his coordinates.--</p><p>"I cannot understand why, as a body, the Clergy are so fatally uninteresting; they who through all their waking hours ought to have fore their one thought, the deepest and most absorbing interests of humanity. It is the curse of making it a profession--a road to get on upon, to succeed in life upon. the base stain is apparent in their very language, too sad an index of what they are. Their 'duty'--what is it? To patter through the two Sunday's services. For a little money one of them will take the other's duty for him. And what do they all aim at? Getting livings!--not cures of souls, but livings: something which will keep their wretched bodies living in the comforts they have found indispensable. What business have they, any one of them, with a thought to what becomes of their poor wretched selves at all? To hear them preaching, to bear the words they use in these same duties of theirs, one would suppose they really believed that getting on, and getting rich, and getting comfortable, were quite the last things a Christian should propsose to himself. They certainly say so. Alas! with the mass of them, the pulpit keeps its old meaning, and is byt a stage. Off the stage there is the old prate of the old world stories, the patronage of this rich man and that, the vacant benefice or Cathedral stall. So and so, luck fellow, has married a Bishop's daughter, and the Bishop himself has the best-dressed wife, and the best equipage in London; and oh, bitterest satire of all, 'the very pulpit eloquence with which they can paint the better life, the beauty of Christianity, is valued only as a means of advancing them into what they condemn. * * * * Oh, what a Clergyman might do! To have them all [the poor] for an hour at least each week, collected to be taught by him, really wishing to listen, if he will but take the trouble to understand them, and to learn what they require to be told. How sick one is of all sermons such as they are! Why will men go on thrashing over and again the old withered staw that was thrashed out centuries ago, when every field is waving with fresh, and quit other crops craving for their hand. * * * * </p><p>"But there are many other things besdies what are in the Bible, which he (the Clergyman) ought to learn if he would assist the people to do what he tells them to do, if he would really give them rest from the painful vacancy of mind, which life spent in routine of never-ending work entails upon them; he should study their work, and the natural laws that are working in it; he should make another version of the Bible for them in what is for ever before thair eyes, in the cornfield , in the meadow, in the workshop, at the weaver's loom, in the market-palces and the warehouses. * * * * Let every flower have a second image to their eyes; let the teeming earth tell of Him as in her unwearied labour-pangs she fashions up the material elements into the great rolling flood life which ebbs and flows around them. They might do something these Clergy if they would go to work over this ground; labouring in good earnest would they be fore the souls of mankind." </p><p>The following passage is at least forcible:-- </p><p>"The men that write books, Carlyle says, are not the world's priests, the spiritual directors of mankind. No doubt they are; and it shows the folly and madness of trying still to enforce tests that you do but silence a man in the pulpit, to send his voice along the press into every corner of the land, God abolished tests for all purpose, except of mischief and vexation, when he gave mankind the printing press. What is the result of sustaining them, but that we are all at the mercy now of some clever self-assumer? and while our nominal teachers answer no end for for us, except the hour's sleep on Sunday, the minds of all of us, from highest Lords to enlightened operatives, are formed in reading-rooms, in lecture-rooms, at the bar of public-houses, by all the shrewdest, and often the most worthless, novel writers or paper editors. Yet even this is better than nothing, better than that people should be left to their pulpit teachers, such as they are."</p><p>MACKAY'S PROGRESS OF THE INTELLECT. </p><p>ART. IV.—The Progress of the Intellect, as Exemplified in the Religious Development of the Greeks and Hebrews. By Robert William Mackay. London: John Chapman. 1850. </p><p>THERE are many, and those not the least powerful thinkers and efficient workers amongst us, who are prone to under-rate critical research into ancient modes of life and forms of thought, alleging that what it behoves us chiefly to ascertain is the truth which comes home to men's business and bosoms in these our days, and not by-gone speculations and beliefs which we can never fully comprehend, and with which we can only yet more imperfectly sympathise. Holding, with Auguste Comte, that theological and metaphysical speculation have reached their limit, and that the only hope of extending man's sources of knowledge and happiness is to be found in positive science, and in the universal application of its principles; they urge that the thinkers who are in the van of human progress should devote their energies to the actual rather than to the retrospective. </p><p>There is, undeniably, truth in this view. It is better to discover and apply improved methods of draining our own towns, than to be able to quote Aristophanes in proof that the streets of Athens were in a state of unmacadamized muddiness—better to reason justly on some point of immediate concern, than to know the fallacies of the ancient sophists—better to look with “awful eye" at the starry heavens, and, under the teaching of Newton and Herschel, feel the immensity, the order, the sublimity of the universe, and of the forces by which it subsists, than to pore over the grotesque symbols, whereby the Assyrian or Egyptian shadowed forth his own more vague impression of the same great facts. But it would be a very serious mistake to suppose that the study of the past and the labours of criticism have no important practical bearing on the present. Our civilization, and, yet more, our religion, are an anomalous blending of lifeless barbarisms, which have descended to us like so many petrifactions from distant ages, with living ideas, the offspring of a true process of development. We are in bondage to terms and conceptions which, having had their root in conditions of thought no longer existing, have ceased to possess any vitality, and are for us as spells which have lost their virtue. The endeavour to spread enlightened ideas is perpetually counteracted by these idola theatri, which have allied themselves, on the one hand with men's better sentiments, and on the other with institutions in whose defence are arrayed the passions and the interests of dominant classes. Now, though the teaching of positive truth is the grand means of expelling error, the process will be very much quickened if the its pioneer; if, by a survey of the past, it can be shown how each age and each race has had a faith and a symbolism suited to its needs and its stage of development, and that for suceeding ages to dream of retaining the spirit along with the forms of the past, is as futile as the embalming of the dead body in the hope that it may one day be resumed by the living soul.</p><p>But apart from this objective utility of critical research, has certain highly advantageous influences on the mind which pursues it. There is so far justice in the common sarcasms against men of erudition par excellance, that they have rarely been distinguished for warmth of moral sympathy, or for fertility and grandeur of conception; but your eminently practical thinker is often beset by a narrowness of another kind. It may be doubted, whether a mind which has no susceptibility to the pleasure of changing its point of view, of mastering a remot form of thought, of percieving identity of nature under variety of manifestation—a perception which resembles an expansion of one's own pre-existence in the past—can possess the flexibility, the ready sympathy, or the tolerance, which characterizes truly philosophic culture. Now and then, however, we meet with nature which combines the faculty for amassing minute erudition with the largeness of view necessary to give it a practical bearing; a high appreciation of the genius of antiquity, with a profound belief in the progressive character of human development—in the eternal freshness of the founts of inspiration, a wonderful intuition of the mental conditions of past ages with an ardent participation in the most advanced ideas and most hopeful efforts of the present; a nature like some mighty river, which, in its long windings through unfrequented regions, gathers mineral and earthy treasures only more effectually to enrich and fertilize the cultivated valleys and busy cities which form the habitation of man. </p><p>Of such a nature, with valuable qualities thus “antithetically mixt," we have evidence in the work before us. It exhibits an industry in research which reminds us of Cudworth, and for which, in recent literature, we must seek a parallel in Germany rather than in England, while its philosophy and its aims are at once lofty and practical. Scattered through its more abstruse disquisitions we find passages of pre-eminent beauty—gems into which are absorbed the finest rays of intelligence and feeling. We believe Mr. Mackay's work is unique in its kind. England has been to use or to emulate the immense labours of Germany in the departments of mythology and biblical criticism; but when once she does so, the greater solidity and directness of the English mind ensure a superiority of treatment. </p><p>The series of subjects which Mr. Mackay has chosen as waymarks in tracing the 'Progress of the Intellect,' are—after an introductory chapter on Intellectual Religion—Ancient Cosmogony; the Metaphysical Idea of God; the Moral Notion of God; the Theory of Mediation; the Hebrew Theory of Retribution and Immortality; the Messianic Theory; Christian Forms and Reforms; and Speculative Christianity. In the introductory dissertation on Intellectual Religion, he developes his view concerning the true basis and character of religion and morals, and the relation between ancient and modern ideas on these subjects, and it is perhaps here that he presents himself to the greatest advantage; this preliminary chapter is a sort of lofty, airy vestibule, in which we gather breath and courage to descend with the author into the crypts of citation and conjecture, into which he is about to introduce us. It is Mr. Mackay's faith that divine revelation is not contained exclusively or pre-eminently in the facts and inspirations of any one age or nation, but is co-extensive with the history of human development, and is perpetually unfolding itself to our widened experience and investigation, as firmament upon firmament becomes visible to us in proportion to the powerand range of our exploring instruments. The master key to this revelation, is the recognition of the presence of undeviating law in the material and moral world—of that invariability of sequence which is acknowledged to be the basis of physical science, but which is still perversely ignored in our social org—nization, our ethics and our religion. It is this invariability of sequence which can alone give value to experience and render education in the true sense possible. The divine yea and nay,the seal of prohibition and of sanction, are effectually impressed on human deeds and aspirations, not by means of Greek and Hebrew, but by that inexorable law of consequences, whose evidence is confirmed instead of weakened as the ages advance; and human duty is comprised in the earnest study of this law and patient obedience to its teaching. While this belief sheds a bright beam of promise on the future career of our race, it lights up what once seemed the dreariest region of history with new interest; every past phase of human development is part of that education of the race in which we are sharing; every mistake, every absurdity into which poor human nature has fallen, may be looked on as an experiment of which we may reap the benefit. A correct generalization gives significance to the smallest detail, just as the great inductions of geology demonstrate in every pebble the working of laws by which the earth has become adapted for the habitation of man. In this view, religion and philosophy are not merely conciliated, they are identical; or rather, religion is the crown and consummation of philosophy—the delicate corolla, which can only spread out its petals in all their symmetry and brilliance to the sun, when root and branch exhibit the conditions of a healthy and vigorous life. Mr. Mackay's preliminary chapter has an independent value, and would be read with interest by many who might not care to follow him in his subsequent inquiry. The dilemma of sensuousness and sentimentalism is thus excellently put:—</p><p>“Religion often appears to be a mere sentiment, because the reason by which it should be disciplined requires long cultivation, and can only gradually assume its proper prominence and dignity. The faculties are seldom combined in its avowed service; and from its consequent misdirection has been inferred the impossibility of finding within the limits of the mind an effectual religious guide. It has even been said that religion has properly nothing to do with the head, but is exclusively an exercise of the heart and feelings; that all the teaching or education which can properly be called 'religious,' consists 'in the formation of the temper and behaviour, the infusing of devotional feeling, and the implanting of Christian principles.' In other words, the highest faculty of the mind is not required in the service of him who bestowed it. Through this narrow view the sentiments are over-excited; the judgment becomes proportionately languid and incapable, the connexion between the theory of practice and duty is unobserved, and dogmas are blindly learned without regard to their origin or meaning. Superficial religion has everywhere the same result; it fluctuates between the extremes of sensibility and superstition, and exhibits in this respect a curious parallel to the analogous catastrophe of natural philosophy. The uneducated feeling has only the alternative of unquestioning credulity, or of sacrificing and abrogating itself. This is the universal dilemma of artificial creeds; their votaries divide into formalists and sceptics, Pharisees and Sadducees; Calvinism, in our own days, has swung back to rationalism, and the symbolical forms of ancient religion are pronounced by a competent observer to have generally led to these extremes.* The passage is easy from one to the other. The devotional feeling of a Catholic of the middle age might have been destroyed, if the doctrines of Copernicus or Galileo had induced him to mistrust the infallibility of the Pope; and in the days of Sir Thomas Browne, it may have been correct to say that a disbelief in witchcraft implied 'a sort of atheism.' Horace was startled out of </p><p>* Plutarch, 'Isis and Osiris,' ch. 67. </p><p>his irreligious philosophy by a clap of thunder; but if a heathen who saw an angry Hecate in the eclipsed moon could have understood a modern almanack, he might at once have fallen into the impiety from which Horace was a convert."—Sec. 3, p. 9. </p><p>Admirable again is the section on Faith, from which we cannot resist giving a long extract:—</p><p>“Religion and science are inseparable. No object in nature, no subject of contemplation is destitute of a religious tendency and meaning. If religion be made to consist only in traditional and legendary forms, it is of course as distinguishable from science as the Mosaic cosmogony from geology; but if it be the ascensio mentis in Beam per scalas creatarum rerum, the evolving the grounds of hope, faith, and duty from the known laws of our being and the constitution of the universe; a religion may be said to include science as its minister, and antiquity, which beheld a divinity in all things, erred only in mistaking its intelligible character, and in making it a mere matter of mystic speculation. In a more limited sense, religion maybe contrasted with science, as something beyond and above it; as beginning where science ends, and as a guide through the realms of the unknown. But the known and the unknown are intimately connected and correlative. A superstructure of faith can be securely built only on the foundations of the known. Philosophy and religion have one common aim; they are but different forms of answer to the same great question—that of man and his destination. . . . . . . . . Faith is, to a great extent, involuntary; it is a law or faculty of our nature, operating silently and intuitively to supply the imperfections of our knowledge. The boundary between faith and knowledge is, indeed, hard to distinguish. We are said to know our own impressions; to believe in their reality, or in the existence of an external cause of them. It follows that the immediate as well as the more remote inferences from phenomena, are the blended fruit of faith and knowledge; and that though faith, properly speaking, is not knowledge, but the admission of certain inferences beyond knowledge, yet it is almost impossible, in tracing back the operations of the mind, to find any, even the most elementary inference, which is not in some degree a compound of both, and which may not ultimately be resolved into a consistent belief in the results of experience. Faith being thus the inseparable companion and offspring of knowledge, is, like it, liable to modification and correct; that which we call our knowledge of the ultimate purpose of existence being, in fact, only a belief or inference from experience, which would lose its rational value if it were supposed to be so complete and infallible as to exempt s from the necessity of further reflection. All human knowledge must partake of the imperfection of the faculties through which derived; and the limited and unsatisfactory character of what we know leaves a wide and most important void to be filled up by our belief. But the more imperfect our knowledge, the more necessary it becomes to examine with suspicion the foundations of the faith so closely connected with it. Faith, as opposed to credulity, and to that blind submission to inexplicable power which usurped its name in the ancient East, is an allegiance of the reason; and as the 'evidence of things unseen,' stands on the verge of mysticism, its value must depend on the discretion with which it is formed and used. Like all the other faculties, the belief requires to be educated; as the feet are taught to walk, the lips and tongue to speak, so the capacity of belief must be taught how to build securely, yet not arrogantly, on the data of experience. Faith is not that belief of St. Augustine, whose merit increased with the absurdity of the proposition, nor that which attributed to the instigation of God the real or projected murder of an only son. An irrational faith grew out of the opposite extreme of incredulity, when men refused to believe the truth, unless authenticated by sensuous evidence that confounded their understandings. True faith is a belief in things probable; it is the assigning to certain inferences a hypothetical objectivity, and upon the conscious acknowledgment of this hypothetical character alone depends its advantage over fanaticism; its moral value and dignity. Between the opposite risks of credulity and scepticism, it must be guided by those broad principles of reason which all the faculties require for their regulation. Reason alone can in each case determine where credulity begins, and fix the limit beyond which the mind should cease to assign even a qualified objectivity to its own imaginations. In its advanced stages faith is a legitimate result of the calculation of probabilities; it may transcend experience, but can never absolutely contradict it. Faith and knowledge tend mutually to the confirmation and enlargement of each other; faith by verification being often transformed into knowledge, and every increase of knowledge supplying a wider and firmer basis of belief. Faith, as an inference from knowledge, should be consistently inferred from the whole of knowledge; since, when estranged and violated, it loses its vitality, and the estrangement is as effectual when it is hastily and unfairly inferred as where it is wholly gratuitous. The same experience which is the source of knowledge being, therefore, the only legitimate foundation of faith, a sound faith cannot be derived from the anomalous and exceptional. It is the avidity for the marvellous, and the morbid eagerness for a cheap and easy solution of the mysteries of existence—a solution supposed to be implied in the conception of an arbitrary and unintelligible rule, which has ever retarded philosophy and stultified religion. Faith naturally arises out of the regular and undeviating. The same unerring uniformity, which alone made experience possible, was also the first teacher of the invisible things of God. It is this</p><p> 	'Elder Scripture, writ by God's own hand, 	Scripture authentic, uncorrupt by man,'</p><p>which is set before every one, without note or comment, and which even Holy Writ points out as the most unquestionable authority by which, both in heaven and earth, the will of God is interpreted mankind. If man is not permitted to solve the problem of existence, he is at least emboldened to hope, and to infer so much from its actual conditions as to feel confident as to its results. Faith takes up the problem exactly where knowledge leaves it, and, as from confounding the objects of the two have arisen the discords of sects and the puzzles of philosophy, so the discovery of their true relations and limits enables the mind to reconcile and account for the controversies of the past, and in some measure to penetrate the mysteries that occasioned them."—vol. i. p. 35. </p><p>Having thus indicated the ground on which he takes his stand, Mr. Mackay commences his survey and delineation of religious development, selecting that of the Hebrews and Greeks as the most typical and complete, and tracing it up to the period when the combination of the two modes of thought in the Alexandrian theosophy formed that web of metaphysical and religious dogma, which constitutes speculative Christianity. While the Hebrew and Greek religions are his main subject, he has not neglected the copious illustration to be drawn from the Persian, the Hindoo and the Northern mythologies, by indicating instances of analogyand of possible derivation, and thus the 'Progress of the Intellect,' is, perhaps, the nearest approach in our language to natural history of religion. The third chapter on the 'Metaphysical Idea of God' is a rich mine of associated facts and ideas; but while admiring the range of learning which it exhibits, it is here that we begin to perceive the author's defects, or rather his redundances. Some of his pages read like extracts from his common-place book, which must be, as Southey said of his own, an urn under the arm of a river-god, rather than like a digested result of study, intended to inform the general reader. Only a devotedness of research such as his own, can give interest and significance to the mass of allusions and particulars with which Mr. Mackay overlays, rather than illustrates, his more general passages, which are usually at once profound and lucid. The popular lecturer on science comes before his audience with a selection of striking and apt experiments in readiness, and is silent as to the morning's preparation in the laboratory; and so the scholar, who would produce a work of general utility, must not drag his readers through the whole region of his own researches, but simply present them with an impressive  d'oeil. The occasional absence of this artistic working-up of materials diminishes the effectiveness of Mr. Mackay's admirable work.</p><p>The introduction of a truly philosophic spirit into the study of mythology—an introduction for which we are chiefly indebted to the Germans—is a great step in advance of the superficial tone of ridicule adopted by many authors of the of the eigteenth century, or the orthodox prepossessions of writers such as Bryant, who saw in the Greek legends simply misrepresentations of the authentic history given in the book of Genesis. The enlarged acquaintance with Hindoo literature, and with the monumental records of other ancient nations, which the last half century has brought us, has rendered more possible that wide comparison which is a requisite for all true, scientific generalization. O. Muller says, obviously enough, that if we possessed no other access to Grecian antiquity than its mythology, a systematic and philosophic explanation of the latter would be im possible; and so while the mythology of one nation is studied apart from that of others, or while what is really mythology in the records of any one nation is not recognized as such, but, though it presents the ordinary mythical elements, is accounted for by a special theory; we shall never arrive at a just and full estimate of this phase of man's religious tendencies. </p><p>Mr. Mackay holds, with Creuzer, that the basis of all mythology was a nature-worship; that “those interpreters are in the main right, who held that the heathen Pantheon, in its infinite diversity of names and personifications, was but a multitudinous, though in its origin, unconscious allegory, of which physical phenomena, and principally the heavenly bodies, were the fundamental types." This primitive period of the myth, in which sacerdotal influence was in the ascendant, he thinks may be designated the Orphic or Cabiric, in distinction from the Epic period, which was characterised by a gradual merging of the mystic or religious feeling in the poetic. He says :—“ Between the life-like Epic and the sombre Orphic style, between the picturesque and eventful romance, in which the gods are the mere machinery of a human drama, and the mystical symbols of theolo gical metaphysics, there must have been many varieties in the treatment of religious legend, tending to reduce its fragmentarymaterials to the consistent and positive forms in which they are found in Homer." In this theory, mythical conception, instead of being a step in advance of fetishism, is a decadence of the religious sentiment from that monotheistic or pantheistic im pression to which it leaps by its first impulse ; general ideas in the process of transmission, or simply as a necessary result of the laws of expression in the early stages of thought, resolve themselves into the crystalline forms of the legend. We will quote the author's own presentation of his opinion. Under the head of ' Relation of Monotheism to Symbolism,' he says:— </p><p>“ It is impossible to assume any period of time at which the vague sense of Deity ceased to be a mere feeling and assumed a specific form, or became an 'idea.' The notion of external power must have been almost instantaneously associated with some external object; and the diversified reflections of the Divine easily came to be looked on as substantive and distinct divinities. But however infinite the variety of objects which helped to develope the notion of Deity, and eventually usurped its place, the notion itself was essentially a concentrated or monotheistic one. A vague monotheism resided in the earliest exertions of thought, being nearly identical with that impression of unity and connection in sensible phenomena, which in its simplest form appears to rise independently of any effort of philosophical comparison. The power of generalization, or of seeing the one in the many, that first element both of science and of religion, is so nearlyinnate or instinctive as to have been termed by Plato a divine or Promethean gift ; and the philosophical conception of the oneness of 'the universe and of its author, usually regarded as the last acquisition of civilization and reflection, appears to have been anticipated by a natural revelation, an indefinite dread of the aggregate of supersensuous nature; which is said to be common even among savages. In this indefinite feeling must be sought, if anywhere, that conceptional monotheism of primitive ages, which like the virtues of the golden age, makes every successive epoch, unless it be the present, appear only as a stage in the progress of degeneracy and aberration. The genius of religion . . . . does not wait for the co-operation of science in order to commence her task, the powers of combination are at work long before the maturity of the reason eventually found necessary to guide them; nay, the origin of religion, like that of civilization, maybe said to be free from many of the corruptions attending its onward progress, which arise from the mind's inability to deal unembarrassed with the multitude of sensuous analogies. Generalization begins before a sufiicient basis has been prepared to make it legitimate,and every successive step in the research into particulars seems to be in mysterious contradiction to the first hurried conclusion. Hence the universal blending of monotheism with polytheism, and the impossibility of discovering historically, which of the two is older or more original."</p><p>Mr. Mackay's main proposition, that the substratum of religious symbolism was a worship or deification of the elements, is well sustained by the evidence; but be perhaps overstates the degree in which the monotheistic idea was originally co-existent with polytheistic personification. To the uncultured intellect, a plurality of divine agencies, analogous to the human, would seem, by their conflicting wills and influences, a natural explanation of physical and moral vicissitudes. As the impression of unity in nature gained force, these agencies would gradually become subordinate to a higher power, but that impression would at first be hardly more than a shadowy presentiment—one of those </p><p>	“ High instincts, before which our mortal nature</p><p>	Doth shudder like a guilty thing surprised."</p><p>That allegorical elements exist to a considerable extent, in the divine, if not in the heroic myths of Greece, there is strong evidence, both presumptive and internal; and the allegorical interpretation, on the lowest estimate of its soundness, is far superior to the pragmatical or semi-historical, which, in endeavouring to show a nucleus of fact in the myths, exhibits an utter blindness to the mental state in which they originated, and simply substitutes an unpoetical fable for a poetical one. But owing to the manysidedness of all symbols, there is a peculiarly seductive influence in allegorical interpretation; an we observe that all writers who adopt it, though they set out with the largest admissions as to the spontaneous and unconscious character of mythical allegory, and the manifold modifications which have obscured it, acquire a sort of fanatical faith in their rule of interpretation, and fall into the mistake of supposing that the conscious allegorizing of a modern can be correct reproduction of what they acknowledge to be unconscious allegorizing in the ancients. We do not </p><p>see what unconscious allegory can mean, unless it be personification accompanied with belief, and with the spontaneous, vivid conception of a symbol, as opposed to the premeditated use of a poetical figure; and this belief would lead to an elaboration of the myth, in harmony rather with the attributed personality than with the true physical characteristics of the object personified. As a painter, in treating an allegorical subject, is led on by his artistic feeling to add one detail after another, until the specific idea with which he began becomes subordinate to the general effect; so the exuberant religious imagination of the Greek, which set out with a personification of the sun or the ocean, would generate myths having relation rather to the human symbol than to the real phenomena of its cosmical prototype. Hence appears to us, that any attempt extensively to trace consistent allegory in the myths must fail. Nor need we regret it, since our interest in the subject is of a different nature from that of the ancient philosophical interpreters, who, living at a period when the myths still constituted the popular religion, were under the necessity of bringing them into accordance with their own moral and religious views. It is enough for us if we have sufficient insight into the myths to form an approximate conception of the state of mind which produced them, and to assign them their true rank in the scale of religious development. Mr. Mackay has not escaped the influence of the allegorizing mania; he does not despair of finding the true cosmical meaning of the most natural human incidents in the Odyssey, or of the tragic conceptions of the dramatists; but if, like the alchymists, he is sometimes in quest of things not in rerum natura, he, he, like them, elicits much that is suggestive in his search. To criticise details would carry us beyond our limits, and we shall do a greater service to the reader by referring him to the work itself, which, open it where he may, will offer both food and stimulus to his thought.</p><p>While the poets of Greece were giving to its religious thought a more and more sensuous expression, its philosophers were working out an opposite result; and Mr. Mackay traces this subtilizing process until it reaches the Aristotelian theosophy, of which he gives a comprehensive and clear account. </p><p>It is in his theory concerning the religious development of the Hebrews, and in his treatment of their records, that Mr. Mackay departs the most widely from prevalent opinion. The idea that many parts of the Old Testament have a mythical character, an idea which was necessary to conciliate them, as well with the philosophic Hebrewism of Philo, as with the Christian morality of Origen, and which has long been familiar to German critics, is still startling to the English theological mind. No thinker of ordinary intelligence can fail to perceive, not merely difference in degree of completeness, but contrast, between the religious conceptions which represented the Deity as sanctioning or prescribing the cunning trickery of Jacob, or the savage cruelties of Joshua, and those which preside over the sublime remonstrances of the prophets; but the explanation is still sought in the theory of accommodation, that is, the puerile and unworthy religious conceptions invariably accompanying an absence of intellectual culture, which in other nations are referred to the general principles of human development, are, in the case of the Hebrews, supposed to have been benevolent falsities on the part of the true God, whereby he allured a barbarous race to his recognition and worship. On this theory, because Abraham had but limited notions of honour and justice, God plagued Pharaoh and Abimelech for being misled by the falsehoods of the father of the faithful, and made those falsehoods redound to the temporal advantge of his chosen servant: because the Israelites were surrounded by examples of idolatrous and sacrificial observance, and had a strong propensity to imitate them, Jehovah, in condescension to their weakness, prescribed for them a ritual analogous in spirit and in symbolism to that of their neighbours: because they were ferocious race, eager to “ eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain," a suitable vent for their destructive energies was found in such requirements as the slaughter of three thousand in their own camp, and the war of extermination against the Canaanites, or in the especial injunction to Joshua to hough the enemy's horses. The only argument by which the theory of accommodation can be sustained is, that in conjunction with that divine countenance of human vice and weakness which it supposes, there were delivered and preserved certain elements of superhuman truth which attest the specifically divine origin of the religion—its distinctive character as a revelation. Now, while the mythical theory does not exclude that more enlarged idea of providential evolution, which sees in the peculiar religious and political history of the Hebrews, a preparation for ushering into the world a religion which anticipates and fulfils the yearnings of man's spiritual nature, it delivers the understanding from a heavy burthen of contradiction and absurdity, and the religious sentiment from the admission of painful anomalies. The fact, that history of all other nations has mythical period, urges a strong presumption, that the Hebrew records will not present an exception in this respect, and an unprejudiced examination confirms this presumption. We find there not only a generic similarity to the gentile myths, in a degrading conception of the divine attributes, with a corresponding crudeness and obliquity of moral views, in an ignorant interpretation of physical phenomena, a love of prodigy, and a lavish supposition of gratuitous miracle, but also a specific resemblance in symbolism. This is visible on a cursory glance, but a nearer investigation discloses overwhelming proof, that the Hebrew writings, far from meriting an exceptional confidence, require, from the evidence they exhibit that the Hebrew mind was peculiarly deficient in a true historical sense, special canons of caution in their interpretation. On applying the test of a critical analysis, the books of the Pentateuch resolve themselves into a compilation of distinct documents, differing in date and frequently in spirit and purpose, as may be seen from the variations and contradictions in their accounts of the same event; and the more ancient of these documents presents internal evidence, that  it was not in existence earlier than the time of Samuel, about 400 years after Moses. The same artificial coherence, the same arbitrariness of classification and of titles, together with palpable inaccuracies and indications of partisanship, characterize large portions, not only of the remaining historical works, but also of the prophetic. Since these conclusions are denied by no competent critic uncommitted to the maintenance of certain tenets, it would be wise in our theological teachers, instead of struggling to retain a footing for themselves and their doctrine on the crumbling structure of dogmatic interpretation, to cherish those more liberal views of biblical criticism, which, admitting of a development of the Christian system corresponding to the wants and the culture of the age, would enable it to strike a firm root in man's moral nature, and to entwine itself with the growth of those new forms of social life to which we are tending. The spirit which doubts the ultimately beneficial tendency of inquiry, which thinks that morality and religion will not bear the broadest daylight our intellect can throw on them, though it may clothe itself in robes of sanctity and use pious phrases, is the worst form of atheism; while he who believes, whatever else he may deny, that the true and the good are synonymous, bears in his soul the essential element of religion. Viewed in this relation, the 'Progress of the Intellect' is a valuable addition to recent examples of plain speaking—of that [other language] which Paul held who the proper effect of confidence in the excellence of revelation, whose manifestation was in the spirit, and not in the letter.</p><p>Before stating Mr. Mackay's theory concerning the Hebrew history and religion, we must express our regret that the force of his conclusions is weakened by his unduly insisting on details difficult of proof, by a frequently infelicitous citation, and by his not giving due value to a free poetical impulse in the figurative language of the Hebrews, a deficiency which sometimes leads him into an almost trivial literalness of interpretation. But notwithstanding these occasional defects, the chapters which treat principally of the Hebrews will repay a close study, both from their suggestiveness, and the soundness of their general views. Mr. Mackay holds that the original God of the Israelites was no other than the Nature-God, El or llus, worshipped in Arabia, Palestine, and Phoenicia, with licentious and sanguinary rites, under the double aspect of Baal and Moloch; and that the purer worship of Jehovah, inculcated by the prophets, and established by Josiah, was a religious reformation among the Hebrews, generated by the growth in civilization consequent on an enlarged commercial intercourse with foreign nations, and contemporaneous with a movement of religious reform which took placethroughout Asia, about 700 B.C., “connected in India with the name of Buddha, in Persia (or Media), with that of Zoroaster, and a century later extending itself by Xenophanes and Heraclitus into Greece." According to this theory, the calf-worship in the wilderness and under the kings, the altars in the high places, and the atrocities of the valley of Hinnom, were not acts of apostacy, but of persistence in early barbarism. In Mr. Mackay's opinion, the account of the Passover, as it now stands, is the veil which the'purer conceptions of later Hebrews cast over the ancient custom of sacrficing first-born children to the bloodthirsty El; the massacre of three thousand Israelites, represented in Exodus as retributive, was probably sacrificial—a huge offering to the same demon, the rather that Aaron, the leader in the calf-worship, was not involved in the same destruction; the command by which God is said to have tempted Abraham, the vow of Jephthah, the slaughter of the seven descendants of Saul, whereby David sought to propitiate his God and avert a famine, are indications that human sacrifices were familiar to the Hebrews; above all, that “passing of children through the fire," recorded of so many kings, and indignantly denounced by the prophets, as a practice habitual to the nation, is most probably to be interpreted as an actual immolation. The somewhat obscure passage, Amos v. 25, 26—“ Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun, your images, the star of your God which ye made to yourselves"—Mr. Mackay thinks important as conveying a denial of the early existence of a pure, Jehovistic religion. A disputed passage is, of course, dubious ground for an inference; but there is ample evidence of a less questionable kind, that the early Hebrew God, whether identical or not with any heathen deity, was of a character widely different from the one proclaimed by Micah, as requiring nothing of man but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</p><p>The original presiding Deity of Israel was, in Mr. Mackay's words, “emphatically the terrific God." The Old Testament abounds in pictures of Divine operations that cannot be regarded as true delineations of the real character of Deity; but only distortions of it, analogous to those exhibited in the mythologies of other countries. The judicious reader of the Hebrew Scriptures, however orthodox his faith, cannot fail to perceive that they exhibit a progress from degrading to enlightened views of Divine nature and government. The writings of the prophets are full of protests against the conceptions of popular ignorance, and by continually expanding and purifying the Jewish ideas of Deity, prepared the way for the reception of the teachings of Christ. This view of the progressive character of “revelation" does not depend for its evidence on minute points of criticism; it rests rather upon broad facts which are open to the apprehension of the most unlearned: and the 'Progress of the Intellect' abounds in statements which place them in the most forcible point of view. To a greater or less extent they are now recognised by Christians of all denominations, and it is impossible to take up the writings, or listen to the discourses of the leading men of any church or sect, without perceiving the influence which they have exerted upon their minds. </p><p>Mr. Mackay's analysis and history of the theory of Mediation, from its earliest mythical embodiments, those “flowers which fancy strewed before the youthful steps of Psyche, when she first set out in pursuit of the immortal object of her love," to its subtilization in philosophy—his delineation of the origin of Christianity as an expansion of the prophetic spiritualism, yet carrying within it certain elements of Jewish symbolism, which have arrested its true development and perverted its influence— his final sketch of the confluence of Greek Philosophy and Christianized Hebrewism—are admirable, both from their panoramic breadth and their richness in illustrative details. We can only recommend the reader to resort himself to this treasury of mingled thought and learning, and, as a further inducement, we will quote the concluding passage from the section on the 'Mediation of Philosophy. </p><p>"The true religious philosophy of an imperfect being is not a system of creed, but, as Socrates thought, an infinite search or approximation. Finality is but another name for bewilderment or defeat, the common affectation of indolence and superstition, a temporary suspension of the mind's health arising from prejudice, and especially from the old error of clinging too closely to notions found instrumental in assisting it after they have ceased to be serviceable, and striving rather to defend and retain them, than toipake them moreiollect. A remnant of the mythical lurks in the very sanctuary of science. Forms or theories ever fall short of nature, though they are ever tending to reach a position above nature, and may often found really to include more than the maker of them the time knew. To a certain extent they are reliable and complete; as a system of knowledge they are but intermediate and preparatory. As matter is the soul's necessary instrument, ignorance, more or less up with all its expressions and forms, may be said to be as it were the eyelid through which it gradually opens itself to the truth, admitting no more than it can for the time support, and, as through a veil, learning to support its lustre. The old religionists discovered a universal cause, personified it and prayed to it. The mere notion seemed not only to satisfy the religious feeling, but to solve all problems. Nations unanimously subscribed to the pious formula, which satisfied their imaginations, and pleased their vanity by cheating them into a belief that they were wise; but which, at the same time, supplanted nature by tradition, the sources of truth by artificial disguises, and at last paralysed the sentiment which gave birth to it. Science, unlike the rude expedient which stupified without nourishing the mind, gratifies the religious feeling without arresting it, and opening out the barren mystery of the one into more explicit and manageable “forms" expressing, not indeed his essence, but his will, feeds an endless enthusiasm by accumulating for ever new objects of pursuit. We have long experienced that knowledge is profitable; we are beginning to find out that it is moral, and shall at last discover it to be religious. Aristotle declared the highest and truest science to be that which is most disinterested; Bacon, treating science as separate from religion, asserted knowledge to be power, and held that truth must be tested by its fruits, that is, its instrumentality in promoting the right and the useful. Both assertions may be justified and reconciled by the fact that, while no real knowledge is powerless or fruitless, the fruits differ in refinement and value, the highest being unquestionably those disinterested gratifications which minister to the highest wants of the highest faculties, and which earned for philosophy the title of divine love, realizing the mysterious longing of the soul, and promoting the accomplishment of its destiny,</p><p> 		'To rise in science as in bliss, 	</p><p>	Initiate in the secrets of the skies.'"</p><p>THE CREED OF CHRISTENDOM. </p><p>The Creed of Christendom: its Foundations and Superstructure. </p><p>By William Rathbone Greg.	John Chapman.</p><p>ENGLISH Protestantism, effete as it seems in its ecclesiastical and sectarian forms, is manifesting the vitality of its roots in the vigorous and rapid growth of free religious inquiry among earnest men. The writers who are heading the present movement against dogmatic theology, are not mere speculators enamoured of theory and careless of its practical results. Still less are they anti-religious zealots who identify all faith with supersition. They are men at once devout and practical, who have been driven into antagonism with the dominant belief by the force of their moral, no less than of their intellectual nature, and who have been led to the avowal of that antagonism, not simply by the impulse of candour, but by an interest in the spiritual well-being of society. They know that to call dogmatic Christianity the popular creed is a misnomer; that the doctrines taught in our pulpit neither have, nor can have, any hold on the masses; and that if our population is to be Christianized, religious teaching must be conducted in a new spirit and on new principles. They protest against the current faith, because they would substitute for it one purer and more influential; they lay the axe to the old, only that there may be freer play for the energies which are ever tending to the development of the new and more perfect. </p><p>Among these pioneers of the New Reformation, Mr. Greg is likely to be one of the most effective. Without any pretension to striking originality or extensive learning, his work perhaps all the more exhibits that sound, practical judgment which discerns at once the hinge of a question, and it bears throughout the impress of an honesty, geniality, and refinement which imply a moral nature of a very high order. The absence of any very profound critical erudition, far from disqualifying Mr. Greg for the task he has undertaken, is essential to the aim of his book--namely, to show at what conclusions concerning the Bible and Christianity a sensible, educated layman is likely to arrive, with such an amount of critical attainment as is compatible with the work that lies before him in daily life. If such conclusions must necessarily be unsound because they are formed in ignorance of the last new edition of every Biblical critic, orthodox or heterodox, the right of private judgment is a nullity, and the unclerical mind must either dismiss the subject altogether, or surrender itself to a more consistent spiritual despotism than that of Protestant divines. The Creed of Christendom claims the attention of the theologian, not that it may teach him Biblical criticism, but that it may render him more familiar with the impression made by the vexed questions of his science on an earnest, cultivated mind, cut off by no barrier of caste or prejudice from full sympathy and acquaintance with the spirit and wants of the age. Another class of readers to whom it is adapted, are those struggling towards free religious thought amidst the impediments of critical ignorance and early artificial associations. To such, Mr. Greg's book will be valuable, both as an introductory manual of Biblical citicism and as a help in the consideration of certain moral questions.</p><p>In stating the reasons which urged him to publication, Mr. Greg says:-- </p><p>"Much observation of the conversation and controversy of the religious world had brought the conviction that the evil resulting from the received notions as to Scriptural authority has been immensely under-estimated. I was compelled to see that there is scarcely a low and dishonouring conception of God current among men, scarcely a political error or misdeed, which Biblica texts are not, and may not be, without any violence to their obvious signification, adduced to countenance and justify. On the other hand I was compelled to see how many clear, honest, and aspiring minds have been hampered and baffled in their struggles after truth and light, how many tender, pure, and loving hearts have been hardned, perverted, and forced to a denial of their nobler nature and their better instincts, by the ruthless influence of some passages of Scripture which seemed in the clearest language to condemn the good and to denounce the true. No work contributed more than Mr. Newman's Phases of Faith, to force upon me the conviction that little progress can be hoped, either for religious science or charitable feeling, till the question of Biblical authority shall have been placed upon a sounder footing, and viewed in a very different light." </p><p>Mr. Greg sets out by examining the dogma of Scriptural inspiration, which he justly regards as the keystone of Protestant orthodoxy. After considering separately each of the grounds on which it rests, he concludes that there is no valid foundation for believing the Hebrew and Christian canonical writings to be inspired, in the ordinary acceptation of the word--that is, dictated or suggested by God; that hence we must regard them "as records, not revelations; as histories, to be investigated like other histories; documents, of which the date, the authorship, the genuineness, the accuracy of the text, are to be ascertained by the same principles as we apply to other documents." Having thus cleared away the dazzling haze with which the inspiration dogma invests the Biblical writings, he proceeds to investigate the genuiness and authenticity of the Old Testament canon, and traces briefly but forcibly the chief results of modern criticism in relation to this subject; indicating such of the reasons on which they are founded as are readily appreciable by the general reader. According to these results, no longer held debateable by critics of high standing, the Pentateuch, instead of being, as is popularly supposed, the production of Moses, is a compilation from separate documents, the earliest of which must have been written as late as the time of Saul; while the whole book of Deuteronomy, and many parts of the preceding books, are irrefragably proved by the subsequent history of the Hebrews to have had no existence prior to the reign of Josiah. Mr. Greg instances some of the straits to which English divines have been driven, in the effort to maintain the authority of the Old Testament in the face of scientific discovery; and dwells on the advantage which would accrue, not only to the truthfulness of divines, but to the real instructiveness of the Hebrew writings, if the latter were regarded as merely human narratives, traditions, and speculations. He next discusses the prophecies, and adduces many considerations tending to prove how far we are from possessing that clear knowledge concerning them which along could warrant the conclusions of orthodoxy. In his opinion,--</p><p>"The Hebrew prophets were wise, gifted, earnest men, deeply conversant with the Past--looking far into the Future--shocked with the unrightuousness around them--sagacious to see impending evil--bold to denounce wickedness in high places--imbued, above all, with an unfailing faith, peculiarly strong among their people, that national delinquency and national virtue would alike meet with a temporal and inevitable retribution--and gifted 'with the glorious faculty of poetic hope, exerted on human prospects, and presenting its results with the vividness of prophecy'--but prophets in no strictre sense than this." </p><p>The Theism of the Hebrews, Mr. Greg maintains, was impure and progressive; they arrived at their mono-theism by the same stages that characterize the development of the human race in general, the Old Testament exhibiting strong evidence that the Hebrew deity was originally a family god, elevated by Moses to the dignity of a national god, and ultimately, owing to the influence of prophets and sages, and yet more to the contact of the Hebrews with other Oriental nations, expanded into the God of the Universe. </p><p>The claims of the New Testament on our credence are next considered. The chapters on the Origin of the Gospels and the Fidelity of the Gospel History contain no fresh contributions to Biblical criticism, nor anything new to persons conversant with this class of subjects; but they are a well arranged summary of salient facts and arguments, gathered chiefly from Strauss, Hug, Schleiermacher, and Hennel. The conclusions to which the writer is led are, that we have no certitude as to the Gospels conveying the testimony of eyewitnesses, while, on the other hand, there is the strongest evidence of their containing a large admixture of legend, and that we can trust them no further than as giving and outline of Christ's life and teaching. Hence Mr. Greg holds that dogmas founded on sayings attributed to Jesus, but discordant with the impression of his character conveyed by the general tenor of the Gospels, must be rejected; for example, the dogmas of the necessity of belief to salvation, the proper Deity of Christ, and the Atonement. We quote some of his reflections on these results:-- </p><p>"In fine, then, we arrive at this irresistable conclusion, that, knowing many passages in the Evangelists to be unauthentic, and hving reason to suspect the authenticity of many others, and not being able with absolute certainty to point to any which are perfectly and indubitably authentic--the probability in favour of the fidelity of any of the texts relied on to prove the peculiar and perplexing doctrines of modern orthodoxy, is far inferior to the probability against the truth of those doctrines. A doctrine perplexing to our reason, and painful to our feelings, may be from God; but in this case the proof of its being from God must be proportionately clear and irrefragable; the assertion fo it in a narrative, which does not scruple to attribute to God's messenger words which he never uttered, is not only no proof, but does not even amount to a presumption. There is not text in the Evangelists, the Divine (or Christian) origin of which is sufficiently unquestionable to enable it to serve as the foundation of doctrines repugnant to natural feeling or to common sense. </p><p>"But it will be objected, if these conclusions are sound, absolute uncertainty is thrown over the whole Gospel history, and over all Christ's teaching. To this we reply, in limine, in the language of Algernon Sydney. 'No consequences can destroy a truth;' the sole matter for consideration is, Are our arguments corrects?--not, Do they lead to a result which is embarassing and unwelcome?</p><p>"But the inference is excessive; the premises do not reach so far. The uncertainty thrown is no over the main points of Christ's history, which, after all retrenchments, still stands out an intelligible, though a skeleton account--not over the grand features, the pervading tone of his doctrines or his character, which still present to us a clear consistent, and splendid delineation; but over those individual statements, passages, and discourses which mar this delineation--which break its unity--which destroy its consistency--which cloud its clearness--which tarnish its beauty. The gain to us seems immense. </p><p>"It is true we have no longer absolute certainty with regard to any one especial text or scene; such is neither necessary nor attainable; it is true that, instead of passively accepting the whole heterogeneous and indigestible mass, we must, by the careful and conscientious exercise of those faculties with which we are endowed, by ratiocination and moreal taxt, separate what Christ did, from what he did not teach, as best we may. But the task will be difficult to those only who look in the Gospels for a minute, dogmatic, and sententious creed; not to those who seek only to learn Christ's spirit that they may imbibe it, and to comprehend his views of virtue and of God, that they may draw strength and consolation from those fountains of living water." </p><p>In discussing the limits of Apostolic wisdom and authority, Mr. Greg's prepossessions, perhaps, lead him to heighten the difference between the spirits and teaching of the Apostles and those of their Master; but for much that he maintains under this head, he has strictly critical grounds. His observatoins on the misapprehension of the Apostles and the early Church concerning the "gift of tongues," are especially just and pointed. In the chapter on Miracles, he treats the subject chiefly  priori grounds, and only cursorily touches on the question whether the miraculous narratives in the Gospels bear the marks of credibility. He argues for the position, long ago stenuously maintained by Locke, and admitted by many even of our orthodox divines, that a miracle can never authenticate a doctrine; and he further shows, that miracles are not a safe foundation on which to rest the claims of Christianity, inasmuch as they are not susceptible of proof by documentary evidence. The crowning miracle of the Resurrection he considers separately, giving a condensed analysis of the evidence on which it rests. The conclustion that this evidence is insufficient is, he thinks, rendered needlessly painful by the undue doctrinal value assigned by theologians to the Resurrection of Christ, whether as a santion of his doctrines, or as a type and pledge of our own resurrection; for, viewed in the one light it is superfluous, while in the other, it utterly fails of the supposed end, since a bodily resurrection after three days' interment, can bear no resemblance to anything that awaits ourselves.</p><p>Even after the renunciation of implicit credence in the Gospel narratives and Apostolic writings, and the rejection of all miraculous evidence, the question remains--Is Christianity a revealed religion? Since, however, the lustre of Christ's life and teaching may have been obscured by the errors and limitations of his biographers and immediate disciples, it is till possible that he may have had a special divine mission. In seeking for an answer to this question, Mr. Greg "finds no adequate reason for believing Jesus to be the son of God, nor his doctrines to be a direct and special revelation." </p><p>The following is his conception of Jesus:-- </p><p>"We do not believe that Christianity contains anything which a genius like Christ's, brought up and nourished as his had been, might not have disentangled for itself. We hold that God has so arranged matters in this beautiful and well-ordered but mysteriously governed univers, that one great mind after another will arise from time to time, as such are needed, to discover and flash forth before the eyes of men the truth that are wanted, and the amount of truth that can be borne. We conceive that this is affected by endowing them--or (for we pretend to no scholastic nicety of expression) by having arranged that nature and the course of events shall send them into the world endowed with that superior mental and moral organization, in which grand truths, sublimes gleams of spiritual light, will spontaneously and inevitably arise. Such a one we believe was Jesus of Nazareth--the most exalted genius whom God ever sent upon earth; in himself an embodies revelation; humanity in its divinest phase--"God manifest in the flesh," according to Eastern hyperbole; an exemplar vouchsafed, in an early age of the world, of what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in his progress towards the realization of his destiny; an individual gifted with a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a find organization, and perfectly balanced moral being; and who, by virture of these endowments, saw further than all other men--</p><p>	"Beyond the verge of that blue sky,</p><p>	Where God's sublimest secrets lie;"</p><p>an earnest, not only of what humanity may be, but of what it will be, when the most perfected races shall bear the same relation to the finest minds of existing times, as these now bear to the Bushmen and the Esquimaux. He was, as Parker beautifully expresses it, 'the possibility of the rare made real.' He was sublime poet, prophet, hero, and philosopher; and had the usual fate of such--misrepresented by his enemies, misconstrued by his friends; unhappy in this, that his nearest intimates and followers were not of a calibre to understand him; happy in this, that his words contained such undying seeds of truth as could survive even the media through which they passed. Like the wheat found in the Egyptian catacombs, the retain the power of germinating undiminished whenever their appropriate soul is found. They have been preserved almost pure, notwithstanding the Judaic narrowness of Peter, the orthodox passions of John, and the metaphysical subtleties of Paul. Everything seems to us to confirm the conclusion that we have in the Christianity of Scripture a code of beautiful, simple, sublime, profound, but not perfect truth, obscured by having come down to us by the intervention of minds far inferior to that of its Author; narrowed by their uncultivation; marred by their misapprehensions; and tarnished by their foreign admixtures. It is a collection of grand truths transmitted to us by men who only half comprehended their grandeur, and imperfectly grasped their truth.' </p><p>If Christianity be no longer regarded as a revelation, but as the conception of a fallible though transcendantly gifted mind, it follows that only so much of it is to be accepted as harmonized with the reason and conscience: Christianity becomes "Christian Eclecticism." Mr. Greg unhesitatingly receives many of Christ's precepts as unsurpassable and unimprovable: for example, those which inculcate the worthlessness of ceremonial observance and the necessity of active virtue, purity of heart as the security for purity of life, universal philanthropy, forgiveness of injuries, self-sacrifice in the cause of duty, humility, and genuine sincerity. He regards as next in perfection the views which Christianity unfolds of God as a Father. </p><p>"In the two great points essential to our practical life, viz., our feelings towards God and our conduct towards man, the Gospels contain little about which men can differ--little from which they can dissent. He is our Father, we are all brethren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fully as to the most leisurely and learned. This needs no priest to teach it, no authority to endorse it. The rest is speculation; intensely interesting, indeed, but of no practical necessity." </p><p>Other tenets taught in the Christian Scriptures, however, Mr. Greg thinks open to grave objections. He urges, for example, that the New Testament assigns an efficacy to prayer incompatible with any elevated conception of Deity; that it inculcates resignation, not as the result of a self-reasoning faith in the wisdom and justice of the supreme will, but on the narrow ground that sufferings are specially ordained for the benefit of the individaul; and that it appeals to the selfish motives--the desire for recompense, rather than to the highest--the love of the good for its own sake. He holds that the conception of the pardon of sin, or repentance and conversions, tends to contravene the system on which man is trained and disciplined, and the entire scheme of God's government--the conviction that every breach of teh Divine law is attended with inexorable consequences, being essential to a healthy condition of the conscience and a just theory of Providence:--</p><p>"Let any one look back upon his past career, look inward on his daily life, and then say what effect would be produced upon him, were the conviction once fixedly embedded in his soul that everything done is done irrevocably, that even the omnipotence of God cannot uncommit a deed, cannot make that undone which has been done; that every act of his must bear its allotted fruit according to the everlasting laws--must remain for ever ineffaceably inscribed on the tablets of universal Nature. And, then let him consider what would have been the result upon the moral condition of our race, had all men ever held this conviction. </p><p>"Perhaps you have led a youth of dissipation and excess which has undermined and enfeebled your constitution, and you have transmitted this injured and enfeebled constitution to your children. They suffer, in consequences, through life; suffering is entailed upon them; your repentance, were it in sackcloth and ashes, cannot help you or them. Your punishment is tremendous, but it is legitimate and inevitable. You have broken Nature's Laws, or you have ignored them, and no violates or neglects them with impunity. What a lesson for timely reflection and obedience is here! </p><p>"Again--you have broken the seventh commandment. You grieve--you repent--you resolutely determine against any such weakness in future. It is well; but 'you know that God is merciful--you feel that he will forgive you.' You are comforted. But no--there is no forgiveness of sins--the injured party may forgive you--your accomplice or victim may forgive you, according to the meaning of human language; but the deed is done, and all the powers of Nature, were they to conspire in your behalf, could not make it undone; the consequences to the body--the consequences to the soul--though no man may perceive them, are there--are written in the annals of the past, and must reverberate through all time. </p><p>"But all this, let it be understtod, in no degree militates against the value or the necessity of repentance. Repentance, contrition of soul, bears, like every other act, its own fruit--the fruit of purifying the heart, of amending the future: not as man has hitherto conceived--of effecing the past. The commission of sin is an irrevocalbe act, but it does not incapacitate the soul for virtue. Its consequences cannot be expunged, but the course need not be pursued. Sin, though it is ineffaceable, calls for no despair, but for efforts more energetic than before. Repentance is till as valid as ever; but it is valid to secure the future, not to obliterate the past. </p><p>"The moral to be drawn from these reflections is this:--God has placed the lot of man--not, perhaps, altogether of the individual, but certainly of the race--in his own hands, by surrounding him with laws, on knowledge of which, and on conformity to which, his well-being depends. The study of these, and the principle of obedience to them, forms, therefore the great aim of education, both of men and nations. They must be taught:-- </p><p>"1. The physical laws, on which God has made health to depend. </p><p>"2. The moral laws, on which He has made happiness to depend. </p><p>"3. The intellectual laws, on which He has made knowledge to depend. </p><p>"4. The social and political laws, on which He has made national prosperity to depend. </p><p>"5. The economic laws, on which He has made wealth to depend. </p><p>"A true comprehension of all these, and of their unexceptional and unalterable nature, would ultimately rescue mankind from all their vice and nearly all their suffering, save casualties and sorrows."</p><p>Mr. Greg also shows that Christianity teaches an ascetic and depreciating view of life, incompatible with that energetic devotion to the improbement of our races, and with that delight in the innocent adornment of our existence in this world, which are essential to a noble and well-balance soul. </p><p>In the concluding chapter we have the author's reflections on "the great enigma--the question of man's future exixtence." He applies himself, evidently with his utmost stength, to prove the invalidity and even futility of a conclusiong which, after all, he himself holds. He labours to make clear that the belief in a future state is not demanded by any process of our intellect or any tendency of our moral nature, in order that he may fall back with the greater confidence on the assertion of his belief in it as an intuition on a par with out belief in the reality of an external worlds. </p><p>We have endeavored to give our readers a faithful idea of Mr. Greg's work. Though far from setting our seal to all his opinions, we think that the Creed of Christendom sets forth very powerfully much truth of which society is in urgent need, while it opens to us an acquaintance with an individual mind possessing a strong moral and intellectual charm. </p><p>The deservedly respecful reception of Mr. Greg's work by the periodical press, compared with that given twelve years ago to a work of kindred character--Hennell's Inquiry concerning the Origin of Christianity--is no slight indication of advancement, either in plain speaking or in liberality of religious views. Though too distinct in their method, and to a considerable extent in their matter, for one to be regarded as superseding the other, both these works have the same object, to ascertain how far the popular idea of Christianity will sustain the test of impartial criticism; they are alike animated by a spirit of candour and reverence, and they have substantially the same result. Hennell, it is true, holds the Jesus shared the common theocratic hope of his nation, and thinks there is strong evidence that, at the commencement of his career, he expected the Divine attestation to his Messiahship to be given in such a general adhesion of the people to his cause as would enable him to free his nation from the Roman yoke by insurrection, and effect the political as well as the spiritual regeneration of Israel. He regards the character of Jesus as less exceptional than it appears under Mr. Greg's view; but he estimates very highly the power and beauty of his nature and the value of his moral teaching. The Inquiry concerning the Origin of Christianity is evidently the production of a mind which has brought to the independent study of the New Testament the rare combination of analytic acumen with breadth of conception. Its merit was at once recognized in Germany, where it was speedily translated. While in our own country it was welcomed by many distinguished minds, and has had an extensive, though latent, influence in promoting the intelligent study of the Christian Scriptures. That Mr. Greg has found it a valuable aid is not only evidence in his text, but avowed by frequent references in his notes, though, doubtless through a temporary forgetfulness, he speaks in his preface as if he had no predecessor among laymen in the path of free but reverent inquiry into the claims of Christianity. </p><p>Nevertheless, when Hennell's work first appeared, the Reviews dared not acknowledge the merit which it was privately admitted to possess, and four years after the appearance of the second edition, it received, from a periodical which has recently bestowed elaborate praise on the Creed of Christendom, a rather contemptuous critique, the object of which was, obviously, to put down the book by no fairer means than that of presenting details, adduced by Hennel merely in the light cumulative evidence as if they formed the sole basis of his argument. </p><p>In this annus mirabilis of 1851, however, our reviewers have attained a higher standard of courage and fairness than could be ascribed to them in 1838, or even in 1845. "La terre tourne," says Pascal, "malgre qu'on le nie; et vous aussi, mes reverends peres, vous tournez avec elle--The earth turns in spite of all denials; and you also, my reverend fathers, turn with it."</p><p>THE LIFE OF STERLING. </p><p>ART. IX.-CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE OF ENGLAND. </p><p>[Under the conviction that brief and incidental literary notices, such as have been hitherto appended to the more important portion of the "Westminster Review," are of little value in a quarterly periodical, it has been determined to substitute for them a connected survey of the chief additions made to our literature during the preceding quarter. The foreign department of the Review, which, since the incorporation of the "Foreign Quarterly" with the "Westminster," has been confined to notices of a few foreign publications, will also, in future, be conducted on a new plan. American, French, and German literature will be treated in separate articles of a like comprehensive character with the one on English literature. It may happen that, for various reasons, the works noticed in each article, especially in the department of foreign literature, will not fall strictly within the limits of the previous quarter; but it is intended that the entire series shall give as complete a retrospect of the course of literary production during the year as the prescribed space will allow.] </p><p>Life of Sterling1. </p><p>	AS soon as the closing of the Great Exhibition afforded a reasonable hope that there would once more be a reading public, "The Life of Sterling" appeared. A new work by Carlyle must always be among the literary births eagerly chronicled by the journals and greeted by the public. In a book of such parentage we care less about the subject than about its treatment, just as we think the "Portrait of a Lord" worth studying if it come from the pencil of a Vandyck. The life of John Sterling, however, has intrinsic interest, even if it be viewed simply as the struggle of a restless aspiring soul, yearning to leave a distinct impress of itself on the spiritual development of humanity, with that fell disease which, with a refinement of torture, heightens the susceptibility and activity of the faculties, while it undermines their creative force. Sterling, moreover, was a man thoroughly in earnest, to whom poetry and philosophy were not merely another form of paper currency or a ladder to fame, but an end in themselves-one of those finer spirits with whom, amidst the jar and hubbub of our daily life,</p><p>"The melodies abide </p><p>Of the everlasting chime." </p><p>But his intellect was active and rapid, rather than powerful, and in all his writings we feel the want of a stronger electric </p><p>1. "The Life of John Sterling." By Thomas Carlyle. London: Chapman and Hall. </p><p>248 Contemporary Literature </p><p>current to give that vigour of conception and felicity of expression, by which we distinguish the undefinable something called genius; while his moral nature, though refined and elevated, seems to have been subordinate to his intellectual tendencies and social qualities, and to have had itself little determining influence on his life. His career was less exceptional than his character: a youth marked by delicate health and studious tastes, a short-lived and not very successful share in the management of the Athenaeum, a fever of sympathy with Spanish patriots, arrested before it reached a dangerous crisis by an early love affair ending in marriage, a fifteen months' residence in the West Indies, eight months of curate's duty at Herstmonceux, relinquished on the ground of failing health, and through his remaining years a succession of migrations to the South in search of a friendly climate, with the occasional publication of an "article," a tale, or a poem in "Blackwood" or elsewhere,-this, on the prosaic background of an easy competence, was what made up the outer tissue of Sterling's existence. The impression of his intellectual power on his personal friends seems to have been produced chiefly by the eloquence and brilliancy of his conversation; but the mere reader of his works and letters would augur from them neither the wit, nor the curiosa felicitas of epithet and imagery, which would rank him with the men whose sayings are thought worthy of perpetuation in books of table talk and "ana." The public, then, since it is content to do without biographies of much more remarkable men, cannot be supposed to have felt any pressing demand even for a single life of Sterling; still less, it might be thought, when so distinguished a writer as Archdeacon Hare had furnished this, could there be any need for another. But, in opposition to the majority of Mr. Carlyle's critics, we agree with him that the first life is properly the justification of the second. Even among the readers personally unacquainted with Sterling, those who sympathised with his ultimate alienation from the Church, rather than with his transient conformity, were likely to be dissatisfied with the entirely apologetic tone of Hare's life, which, indeed, is confessedly an incomplete presentation of Sterling's mental course after his opinions diverged from those</p><p>of his clerical biographer; while those attached friends (and Sterling possessed the happy magic that secures many such)who knew him best during this latter part of his career, would naturally be pained to have it represented, though only by implication, as a sort of deepening declension ending in a virtual retractation. Of such friends Carlyle was the most eminent, and perhaps the most highly valued, and, as co-trustee with Arch- </p><p>of England. 249 </p><p>deacon Hare of Sterling's literary character and writings, he felt a kind of responsibility that no mistaken idea of his departed friend should remain before the world without correction. Evidently, however, his "Life of Sterling" was not so much the conscientious discharge of a trust as a labour of love, and to this is owing its strong charm. Carlyle here shows us his "sunny side." We no longer see him breathing out threatenings and slaughter as in the Latter-Day Pamphlets, but moving among the charities and amenities of life, loving and beloved- a Teufelsd ckh still, but humanized by a Blumine worthy of him. We have often wished that genius would incline itself more frequently to the task of the biographer,-that when some great or good personage dies, instead of the dreary three or five volumed compilations of letter, and diary, and detail, little to the purpose, which two-thirds of the reading public have not the chance, nor the other third the inclination, to read, we could have a real "Life," setting forth briefly and vividly the man's inward and outward struggles, aims, and achievements, so as to make clear the meaning which his experience has for his fellows. A few such lives (chiefly, indeed, autobiographies) the world possesses, and they have, perhaps, been more influential on the formation of character than any other kind of reading. But the conditions required for the perfection of life writing,- personal intimacy, a loving and poetic nature which sees the beauty and the depth of familiar things, and the artistic power which seizes characteristic points and renders them with life like effect,-are seldom found in combination. "The Life of Sterling" is an instance of this rare conjunction. Its comparatively tame scenes and incidents gather picturesqueness and interest under the rich lights of Carlyle's mind. We are told neither too little nor too much; the facts noted, the letters selected, are all such as serve to give the liveliest conception of what Sterling was and what he did; and though the book speaks much of other persons, this collateral matter is all a kind of scene-painting, and is accessory to the main purpose. The portrait of Coleridge, for example, is precisely adapted to bring before us the intellectual region in which Sterling lived for some time before entering the Church. Almost every review has extracted this admirable description, in which genial veneration and compassion struggle with irresistible satire; but the emphasis of quotation cannot be too often given to the following pregnant paragraph:-</p><p>	"The truth is, I now see Coleridge's talk and speculation was the emblem of himself. In it, as in him, a ray of heavenly inspiration struggled, in a tragically ineffectual degree, with the weakness of flesh and blood. He says once, he 'had skirted the howling deserts of in-</p><p>250. Contemporary Literature </p><p>fidelity.' This was evident enough; but he had not had the courage, in defiance of pain and terror, to press resolutely across said deserts to the new firm lands of faith beyond; he preferred to create logical fatamorganas for himself on this hither side, and laboriously solace himself with these." </p><p>	The above-mentioned step of Sterling-his entering the Church-is the point on which Carlyle is most decidedly at issue with Archdeacon Hare. The latter holds that had Sterling's health permitted him to remain in the Church, he would have escaped those aberrations from orthodoxy, which, in the clerical view, are to be regarded as the failure and shipwreck of his career, apparently thinking, like that friend of Arnold's who recommended a curacy as the best means of clearing up Trinitarian difficulties, that "orders" are a sort of spiritual backboard, which, by dint of obliging a man to look as if he were strait, end by making him so. According to Carlyle, on the contrary, the real "aberration" of Sterling was his choice of the clerical profession, which was simply a mistake as to his true vocation:-</p><p>	"Sterling," he says, "was not intrinsically, nor had ever been in the highest or chief degree, a devotional mind. Of course all excellence in man, and worship as the supreme excellence, was part of the inheritance of this gifted man; but if called to define him, I should say artist, not saint, was the real bent of his being."</p><p>Again:- </p><p>	"No man of Sterling's veracity, had he clearly consulted his own heart, or had his own heart been capable of clearly responding, and not been bewildered by transient fantasies and theosophic moonshine, could have undertaken this function. His heart would have answered, No, thou canst not. What is incredible to thee, thou shalt not, at thy soul's peril, attempt to believe! Elsewhither for a refuge, or die here. Go to perdition if thou must, but not with a lie in thy month; by the eternal Maker, no !'"</p><p>	From the period when Carlyle's own acquaintance with Sterling commenced, the Life has a double interest, from the glimpses it gives us of the writer, as well as of his hero. We are made present at their first introduction to each other; we get a lively idea of their colloquies and walks together, and in this easy way, without any heavy disquisition or narrative, we obtain a clear insight into Sterling's character and mental progress. Above all, we are gladdened with a perception of the affinity that exists between noble souls, in spite of diversity in ideas-in what Carlyle calls "the logical outcome" of the faculties. This "Life of Sterling" is a touching monument of the capability human nature possesses of the highest love, the</p><p>of England. 251 </p><p>love of the good and beautiful in character, which is, after all, the essence of piety. The style of the work, too, is for the most part at once pure and rich; there are passages of deep pathos which come upon the reader like a strain of solemn music, and others which show that aptness of epithet, that masterly power of close delineation, in which, perhaps, no writer has excelled Carlyle. </p><p>	We have said that we think this second "Life of Sterling" justified by the first; but were it not so, the book would justify itself.</p><p>Suwarow and his last Campaign2.</p><p>	Major Macready's work on Suwarow may be read with interest apart from any special acquaintance with military operations. The writer, himself a soldier of reputation, who threw his energies thoroughly into his calling, sympathizing with the moral qualities of Suwarow, and believing that his last campaign had not been fairly represented by historians, was induced to devote some of the leisure afforded by retirement from the service to a vindication of the Russian hero. The result was the present work, left by him in manuscript, and now published by his widow, under the editorship of an officer of rank. The examination of the last campaign is preceded by a sketch of the appearance, character, and habits of the eccentric general, illustrated by many pithy anecdotes. The intellectual power of Suwarow (General Vorw rts, as he was christened by the Austrians), lay in rapid perception; his moral power, in the alliance of thorough honesty and disinterested devotion to duty with indomitable courage and perseverance. In the higher qualities of the intellect, which give prescience of probabilities, and lead to grand combinations, he was utterly deficient. Hence he could only be, as Major Macready admits, a second-rate general. He had no faith in military science, and declaimed against it as "scribentismus" and "system-mongering," constantly reiterating his favourite dogma- "No rule-and-line work: coup-d'oeil." In one of the elements of good generalship, however-personal influence over his men-he has seldom been surpassed, owing, perhaps, partly to his placing himself on a level with them in his personal habits, and sharing all their hardships.</p><p>	"His food, straw (for he used no bed), and lodging, were the same as theirs.

London : Smith and Elder. </p><p>WOMAN IN FRANCE: MADAME DE SABLÉ. </p><p>In 1847, a certain Count Leopold Ferri died at Padua, leaving a library entirely composed of works written by women, in various languages, and this library amounted to nearly 32,000 volumes. We will not hazard any conjecture as to the proportion of these volumes which a severe judge, like the priest in Don Quixote, would deliver to the flames, but for our own part, most of these we should care to rescue would be the works of French women. With a few remarkable exceptions, our own feminine literature is made up of books which could have been better written by men—books which have the same relation to literature is general, as academic prize poems have to poetry: when not a feeble imitation, they are usually an absurd exaggeration of the masculine style, like the swaggering gait of a bad actress in male attire. Few English women have written so much like a woman as Richardson’s Lady G. Now we think it an immense mistake to maintain that there is no sex in literature. Science has no sex: the mere knowing and reasoning faculties, if they act correctly, must go through the same process, and arrive at the same result. But in art and literature, which imply the action of the entire being, in which every fibre of the nature is engaged, in which every peculiar modification of the individual makes itself felt, woman has something specific to contribute. Under every imaginable social condition, she will necessarily have a class of sensations and emotions—the maternal ones—which must remain unknown to man; and the fact of her comparative physical weakness, which, however it may have been exaggerated by a vicious civilization, can never be cancelled, introduces a distinctively feminine condition into the wondrous chemistry of the affections and sentiments, which inevitably gives rise to distinctive forms and combinations. A certain amount of psychological difference between man and woman necessarily arises out of the difference of sex, and instead of being destined to vanish before a complete development of woman’s intellectual and moral nature, will be a permanent source of variety and beauty as long as the tender light and dewy freshness of morning affect us differently from the strength and brilliancy of the midday sun. And those delightful women of France, who from the beginning of the seventeenth to the close of the eighteenth century, formed some of the brightest threads in the web of political and literary history, wrote under circumstances which left the feminine character of their minds uncramped by timidity, and unstrained by mistaken effort. They were not trying to make a career for themselves; they thought little, in many cases not at all, of the public; they wrote letters to their lovers and friends, memoirs of their every-day lives, romances in which they gave portraits of their familiar acquaintances, and described the tragedy or comedy which was going on before their eyes. Always refined and graceful, often witty, sometimes judicious, they wrote what they saw, thought, and felt in their habitual language, without proposing any model to themselves, without any intention to prove that women could write as well as men, without affecting manly views or suppressing womanly ones. One may say, at least with regard to the women of the seventeenth century, that their writings were but a charming accident of their more charming lives, like the petals which the wind shakes from the rose in its bloom. And it is but a twin fact with this, that in France alone woman has had a vital influence on the development of literature; in France alone the mind of woman has passed like an electric current through the language, making crisp and definite what is elsewhere heavy and blurred; in France alone, if the writings of women were swept away, a serious gap would be made in the national history.</p><p>Patriotic gallantry may perhaps contend that English women could, if they had liked, have written as well as their neighbors; but we will leave the consideration of that question to the reviewers of the literature that might have been. In the literature that actually is, we must turn to France for the highest examples of womanly achievement in almost every department. We confess ourselves unacquainted with the productions of those awful women of Italy, who held professorial chairs, and were great in civil and canon law; we have made no researches into the catacombs of female literature, but we think we may safely conclude that they would yield no rivals to that which is still unburied; and here, we suppose, the question of pre-eminence can only lie between England and France. And to this day, Madame de Sévigné remains the single instance of a woman who is supreme in a class of literature which has engaged the ambition of men; Madame Dacier still reigns the queen of blue stockings, though women have long studied Greek without shame; [33] Madame de Staël’s name still rises first to the lips when we are asked to mention a woman of great intellectual power; Madame Roland is still the unrivalled type of the sagacious and sternly heroic, yet lovable woman; George Sand is the unapproached artist who, to Jean Jacques’ eloquence and deep sense of external nature, unites the clear delineation of character and the tragic depth of passion. These great names, which mark different epochs, soar like tall pines amidst a forest of less conspicuous, but not less fascinating, female writers; and beneath these, again, are spread, like a thicket of hawthorns, eglantines, and honey-suckles, the women who are known rather by what they stimulated men to write, than by what they wrote themselves—the women whose tact, wit, and personal radiance created the atmosphere of the Salon, where literature, philosophy, and science, emancipated from the trammels of pedantry and technicality, entered on a brighter stage of existence. </p><p>What were the causes of this earlier development and more abundant manifestation of womanly intellect in France? The primary one, perhaps, lies in the physiological characteristics of the Gallic race—the small brain and vivacious temperament which permit the fragile system of woman to sustain the superlative activity requisite for intellectual creativeness; while, on the other hand, the larger brain and slower temperament of the English and Germans are, in the womanly organization, generally dreamy and passive. The type of humanity in the latter may be grander, but it requires a larger sum of conditions to produce a perfect specimen. Throughout the animal world, the higher the organization, the more frequent is the departure from the normal form; we do not often see imperfectly developed or ill-made insects, but we rarely see a perfectly developed, well-made man. And thus the physique of a woman may suffice as the substratum for a superior Gallic mind, but is too thin a soil for a superior Teutonic one. Our theory is borne out by the fact that among our own country-women those who distinguish themselves by literary production more frequently approach the Gallic than the Teutonic type; they are intense and rapid rather than comprehensive. The woman of large capacity can seldom rise beyond the absorption of ideas; her physical conditions refuse to support the energy required for spontaneous activity; the voltaic-pile is not strong enough to produce crystallizations; phantasms of great ideas float through her mind, but she has not the spell which will arrest them, and give them fixity. This, more than unfavorable external circumstances, is, we think, the reason why woman has not yet contributed any new form to art, any discovery in science, any deep-searching inquiry in philosophy. The necessary physiological conditions are not present in her. That under more favorable circumstances in the future, these conditions may prove compatible with the feminine organization, it would be rash to deny. For the present, we are only concerned with our theory so far as it presents a physiological basis for the intellectual effectiveness of French women.</p><p>A secondary cause was probably the laxity of opinion and practice with regard to the marriage-tie. Heaven forbid that we should enter on a defence of French morals, most of all in relation to marriage! But it is undeniable that unions formed in the maturity of thought and feeling, and grounded only on inherent fitness and mutual attraction, tended to bring women into more intelligent sympathy with men, and to heighten and complicate their share in the political drama. The quiescence and security of the conjugal relation are doubtless favorable to the manifestation of the highest qualities by persons who have already attained a high standard of culture, but rarely foster a passion sufficient to rouse all the faculties to aid in winning or retaining its beloved object—to convert indolence into activity, indifference into ardent partisanship, dulness into perspicuity. Gallantry and intrigue are sorry enough things in themselves, but they certainly serve better to arouse the dormant faculties of woman than embroidery and domestic drudgery, especially when, as in the high society of France in the seventeenth century, they are refined by the influence of Spanish chivalry, and controlled by the spirit of Italian causticity. The dreamy and fantastic girl was awakened to reality by the experience of wifehood and maternity, and became capable of loving, not a mere phantom of her own imagination, but a living man, struggling with the hatreds and rivalries of the political arena; she espoused his quarrels, she made herself, her fortune, and her influence, the stepping-stones of his ambition; and the languid beauty, who had formerly seemed ready to “die of a rose,” was seen to become the heroine of an insurrection. The vivid interest in affairs which was thus excited in woman must obviously have tended to quicken her intellect, and give it a practical application; and the very sorrows—the heart-pangs and regrets which are inseparable from a life of passion—deepened her nature by the questioning of self and destiny which they occasioned, and by the energy demanded to surmount them and live on. No wise person, we imagine, wishes to restore the social condition of France in the seventeenth century, or considers the ideal programme of woman’s life to be a marriage de convenance at fifteen, a career of gallantry from twenty to eight-and-thirty, and penitence and piety for the rest of her days. Nevertheless, that social condition has its good results, as much as the madly superstitious Crusades had theirs. </p><p>But the most indisputable source of feminine culture and development in France was the influence of the salons, which, as all the world knows, were réunions of both sexes, where conversation ran along the whole gamut of subjects, from the frothiest vers de société to the philosophy of Descartes. Richelieu had set the fashion of uniting a taste for letters with the habits of polite society and the pursuits of ambition; and in the first quarter of the seventeenth century there were already several hôtels in Paris, varying in social position from the closest proximity of the Court to the debatable ground of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, which served as a rendezvous for different circles of people, bent on entertaining themselves either by showing talent or admiring it. The most celebrated of these rendezvous was the Hôtel de Rambouillet, which was at the culmination of its glory in 1630, and did not become quite extinct until 1648, when the troubles of the Fronde commencing, its habitués were dispersed or absorbed by political interests. The presiding genius of this salon, the Marquise de Rambouillet, was the very model of the woman who can act as anamalgam to the most incongruous elements; beautiful, but not preoccupied by coquetry, or passion; an enthusiastic admirer of talent, but with no pretensions to talent on her own part; exquisitely refined in language and manners, but warm and generous withal; not given to entertain her guests with her own compositions, or to paralyze them by her universal knowledge. She had once meant to learn Latin, but had been prevented by an illness; perhaps she was all the better acquainted with Italian and Spanish productions, which, in default of a national literature, were then the intellectual pabulum of all cultivated persons in France who are unable to read the classics. In her mild, agreeable presence was accomplished that blending of the high-toned chivalry of Spain with the caustic wit and refined irony of Italy, which issued in the creation of a new standard of taste—the combination of the utmost exaltation in sentiment with the utmost simplicity of language. Women are peculiarly fitted to further such a combination—first, from their greater tendency to mingle affection and imagination with passion, and thus subtilize it into sentiment; and next, from that dread of what overtaxes their intellectual energies, either by difficulty, or monotony, which gives them an instinctive fondness for lightness of treatment and airiness of expression, thus making them cut short all prolixity and reject all heaviness. When these womanly characteristics were brought into conversational contact with the materials furnished by such minds as those of Richelieu, Corneille, the Great Condé, Balzac, and Bossuet, it is no wonder that the result was something piquant and charming. Those famous habitués of the Hôtel de Rambouillet did not, apparently, first lay themselves out to entertain the ladies with grimacing “small-talk,” and then take each other by the sword-knot to discuss matters of real interest in a corner; they rather sought to present their best ideas in the guise most acceptable to intelligent and accomplished women. And the conversation was not of literature only: war, politics, religion, the lightest details of daily news—everything was admissible, if only it were treated with refinement and intelligence. The Hôtel de Rambouillet was no mere literary réunion; it included hommes d’affaires and soldiers as well as authors, and in such a circle women would not become bas bleus or dreamy moralizers, ignorant of the world and of human nature, but intelligent observers of character and events. It is easy to understand, however, that with the herd of imitators who, in Paris and the provinces, aped the style of this famous salon, simplicity degenerated into affectation, and nobility of sentiment was replaced by an inflated effort to outstrip nature, so that the genre précieux drew down the satire, which reached its climax in the Précieuses Ridicules and Les Femmes Savantes, the former of which appeared in 1660, and the latter in 1673. But Madelon and Caltros are the lineal descendants of Mademoiselle Scudery and her satellites, quite as much as of the Hôtel de Rambouillet. The society which assembled every Saturday in her salon was exclusively literary, and although occasionally visited by a few persons of high birth, bourgeois in its tone, and enamored of madrigals, sonnets, stanzas, and bouts rimés. The affectation that decks trivial things in fine language belongs essentially to a class which sees another above it, and is uneasy in the sense of its inferiority; and this affectation is precisely the opposite of the original genre précieux.</p><p>Another centre from which feminine influence radiated into the national literature was the Palais du Luxembourg, where Mademoiselle d’Orleans, in disgrace at court on account of her share in the Fronde, held a little court of her own, and for want of anything else to employ her active spirit busied herself with literature. One fine morning it occurred to this princess to ask all the persons who frequented her court, among whom were Madame de Sévigné, Madame de la Fayette, and La Rochefoucauld, to write their own portraits, and she at once set the example. It was understood that defects and virtues were to be spoken of with like candor. The idea was carried out; those who were not clever or bold enough to write for themselves employing the pen of a friend. </p><p>“Such,” says M. Cousin, “was the pastime of Mademoiselle and her friends during the years 1657 and 1658: from this pastime proceeded a complete literature. In 1659 Ségrais revised these portraits, added a considerable number in prose and even in verse, and published the whole in a handsome quarto volume, admirably printed, and now become very rare, under the title, ‘Divers Portraits.’ Only thirty copies were printed, not for sale, but to be given as presents by Mademoiselle. The work had a prodigious success. That which had made the fortune of Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s romances—the pleasure of seeing one’s portrait a little flattered, curiosity to see that of others, the passion which the middle class always have had and will have for knowing what goes on in the aristocratic world (at that time not very easy of access), the names of the illustrious persons who were here for the first time described physically and morally with the utmost detail, great ladies transformed all at once into writers, and unconsciously inventing a new manner of writing, of which no book gave the slightest idea, and which was the ordinary manner of speaking of the aristocracy; this undefinable mixture of the natural, the easy, and at the same time of the agreeable, and supremely distinguished—all this charmed the court and the town, and very early in the year 1659 permission was asked of Mademoiselle to give a new edition of the privileged book for the use of the public in general.” </p><p>The fashion thus set, portraits multiplied throughout France, until in 1688 La Bruyère adopted the form in his “Characters,” and ennobled it by divesting it of personality. We shall presently see that a still greater work than La Bruyère’s also owed its suggestion to a woman, whose salon was hardly a less fascinating resort than the Hôtel de Rambouillet itself. </p><p>In proportion as the literature of a country is enriched and culture becomes more generally diffused, personal influence is less effective in the formation of taste and in the furtherance of social advancement. It is no longer the coterie which acts on literature, but literature which acts on the coterie; the circle represented by the word public is ever widening, and ambition, poising itself in order to hit a more distant mark, neglects the successes of the salon. What was once lavished prodigally in conversation is reserved for the volume or the “article,” and the effort is not to betray originality rather than to communicate it. As the old coach-roads have sunk into disuse through the creation of railways, so journalism tends more and more to divert information from the channel of conversation into the channel of the Press; no one is satisfied with a more circumscribed audience than that very indeterminate abstraction “the public,” and men find a vent for their opinions not in talk, but in “copy.” We read the Athenæum askance at the tea-table, and take notes from the Philosophical Journal at a soirée; we invite our friends that we may thrust a book into their hands, and presuppose an exclusive desire in the “ladies” to discuss their own matters, “that we may crackle the Times” at our ease. In fact, the evident tendency of things to contract personal communication within the narrowest limits makes us tremble lest some further development of the electric telegraph should reduce us to a society of mutes, or to a sort of insects communicating by ingenious antenna of our own invention. Things were far from having reached this pass in the last century; but even then literature and society had outgrown the nursing of coteries, and although many salons of that period were worthy successors of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, they were simply a recreation, not an influence. Enviable evenings, no doubt, were passed in them; and if we could be carried back to any of them at will, we should hardly know whether to choose the Wednesday dinner at Madame Geoffrin’s, with d’Alembert, Mademoiselle de l’Espinasse, Grimm, and the rest, or the graver society which, thirty years later, gathered round Condorcet and his lovely young wife. The salon retained its attractions, but its power was gone: the stream of life had become too broad and deep for such small rills to affect it.</p><p>A fair comparison between the French women of the seventeenth century and those of the eighteenth would, perhaps, have a balanced result, though it is common to be a partisan on this subject. The former have more exaltation, perhaps more nobility of sentiment, and less consciousness in their intellectual activity—less of the femme auteur, which was Rousseau’s horror in Madame d’Epinay; but the latter have a richer fund of ideas—not more ingenuity, but the materials of an additional century for their ingenuity to work upon. The women of the seventeenth century, when love was on the wane, took to devotion, at first mildly and by halves, as English women take to caps, and finally without compromise; with the women of the eighteenth century, Bossuet and Massillon had given way to Voltaire and Rousseau; and when youth and beauty failed, then they were thrown on their own moral strength. </p><p>M. Cousin is especially enamored of the women of the seventeenth century, and relieves himself from his labors in philosophy by making researches into the original documents which throw light upon their lives. Last year he gave us some results of these researches in a volume on the youth of the Duchess de Longueville; and he has just followed it up with a second volume, in which he further illustrates her career by tracing it in connection with that of her friend, Madame de Sablé. The materials to which he has had recourse for this purpose are chiefly two celebrated collections of manuscript: that of Conrart, the first secretary to the French Academy, one of those universally curious people who seem made for the annoyance of contemporaries and the benefit of posterity; and that of Valant, who was at once the physician, the secretary, and general steward of Madame de Sablé, and who, with or without her permission, possessed himself of the letters addressed to her by her numerous correspondents during the latter part of her life, and of various papers having some personal or literary interest attached to them. From these stores M. Cousin has selected many documents previously unedited; and though he often leaves us something to desire in the arrangement of his materials, this volume of his on Madame de Sablé is very acceptable to us, for she interests us quite enough to carry us through more than three hundred pages of rather scattered narrative, and through an appendix of correspondence in small type. M. Cousin justly appreciates her character as “un heureux mélange de raison, d’esprit, d’agrément, et de bonté;” and perhaps there are few better specimens of the woman who is extreme in nothing but sympathetic in all things; who affects us by no special quality, but by her entire being; whose nature has no tons criards, but is like those textures which, from their harmonious blending of all colors, give repose to the eye, and do not weary us though we see them every day. Madame de Sablé is also a striking example of the one order of influence which woman has exercised over literature in France; and on this ground, as well as intrinsically, she is worth studying. If the reader agrees with us he will perhaps be inclined, as we are, to dwell a little on the chief points in her life and character. </p><p>Madeline de Souvré, daughter of the Marquis of Courtenvaux, a nobleman distinguished enough to be chosen as governor of Louis XIII., was born in 1599, on the threshold of that seventeenth century, the brilliant genius of which is mildly reflected in her mind and history. Thus, when in 1635 her more celebrated friend, Mademoiselle de Bourbon, afterward the Duchess de Longueville, made her appearance at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, Madame de Sablé had nearly crossed that tableland of maturity which precedes a woman’s descent toward old age. She had been married in 1614, to Philippe Emanuel de Laval-Montmorency, Seigneur de Bois-Dauphin, and Marquis de Sablé, of whom nothing further is known than that he died in 1640, leaving her the richer by four children, but with a fortune considerably embarrassed. With beauty and high rank added to the mental attractions of which we have abundant evidence, we may well believe that Madame de Sablé’s youth was brilliant. For her beauty, we have the testimony of sober Madame de Motteville, who also speaks of her as having “beaucoup de lumière et de sincérité;” and in the following passage very graphically indicates one phase of Madame de Sablé’s character:</p><p>“The Marquise de Sablé was one of those whose beauty made the most noise when the Queen came into France. But if she was amiable, she was still more desirous of appearing so; this lady’s self-love rendered her too sensitive to the regard which men exhibited toward her. There yet existed in France some remains of the politeness which Catherine de Medici had introduced from Italy, and the new dramas, with all the other works in prose and verse, which came from Madrid, were thought to have such great delicacy, that she (Madame de Sablé) had conceived a high idea of the gallantry which the Spaniards had learned from the Moors. </p><p>“She was persuaded that men can, without crime, have tender sentiments for women—that the desire of pleasing them led men to the greatest and finest actions—roused their intelligence, and inspired them with liberality, and all sorts of virtues; but, on the other hand, women, who were the ornament of the world, and made to be served and adored, ought not to admit anything from them but their respectful attentions. As this lady supported her views with much talent and great beauty, she had given them authority in her time, and the number and consideration of those who continued to associate with her have caused to subsist in our day what the Spaniards call finezas.” </p><p>Here is the grand element of the original femme précieuse, and it appears farther, in a detail also reported by Madame de Motteville, that Madame de Sablé had a passionate admirer in the accomplished Duc de Montmorency, and apparently reciprocated his regard; but discovering (at what period of their attachment is unknown) that he was raising a lover’s eyes toward the queen, she broke with him at once. “I have heard her say,” tells Madame de Motteville, “that her pride was such with regard to the Duc de Montmorency, that at the first demonstrations which he gave of his change, she refused to see him any more, being unable to receive with satisfaction attentions which she had to share with the greatest princess in the world.” There is no evidence except the untrustworthy assertion of Tallement de Réaux, that Madame de Sablé had any other liaison than this; and the probability of the negative is increased by the ardor of her friendships. The strongest of these was formed early in life with Mademoiselle Dona d’Attichy, afterward Comtesse de Maure; it survived the effervescence of youth, and the closest intimacy of middle age, and was only terminated by the death of the latter in 1663. A little incident in this friendship is so characteristic in the transcendentalism which was then carried into all the affections, that it is worth relating at length. Mademoiselle d’Attichy, in her grief and indignation at Richelieu’s treatment of her relative, quitted Paris, and was about to join her friend at Sablé, when she suddenly discovered that Madame de Sablé, in a letter to Madame de Rambouillet, had said that her greatest happiness would be to pass her life with Julie de Rambouillet, afterward Madame de Montausier. To Anne d’Attichy this appears nothing less than the crime of lèse-amitié. No explanations will appease her: she refuses to accept the assurance that the offensive expression was used simply out of unreflecting conformity to the style of the Hôtel de Rambouillet—that it was mere “galimatias.” She gives up her journey, and writes a letter, which is the only one Madame de Sablé chose to preserve, when, in her period of devotion, she sacrificed the records of her youth. Here it is:</p><p>“I have seen this letter in which you tell me there is so much galimatias, and I assure you that I have not found any at all. On the contrary, I find everything very plainly expressed, and among others, one which is too explicit for my satisfaction—namely, what you have said to Madame de Rambouillet, that if you tried to imagine a perfectly happy life for yourself, it would be to pass it all alone with Mademoiselle de Rambouillet. You know whether any one can be more persuaded than I am of her merit; but I confess to you that that has not prevented me from being surprised that you could entertain a thought which did so great an injury to our friendship. As to believing that you said this to one, and wrote it to the other, simply for the sake of paying them an agreeable compliment, I have too high an esteem for your courage to be able to imagine that complaisance would cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your heart, especially on a subject in which, as they were unfavorable to me, I think you would have the more reason for concealing them, the affection which I have for you being so well known to every one, and especially to Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, so that I doubt whether she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you have done me, than of the advantage you have given her. The circumstance of this letter falling into my hands has forcibly reminded me of these lines of Bertaut: </p><p>“‘Malheureuse est l’ignorance </p><p>Et plus malheureux le savoir.” </p><p>“Having through this lost a confidence which alone rendered life supportable to me, it is impossible for me to take the journey so much thought of. For would there be any propriety in travelling sixty miles in this season, in order to burden you with a person so little suited to you, that after years of a passion without parallel, you cannot help thinking that the greatest pleasure of your life would be to pass it without her? I return, then, into my solitude, to examine the defects which cause me so much unhappiness, and unless I can correct them, I should have less joy than confusion in seeing you.” </p><p>It speaks strongly for the charm of Madame de Sablé’s nature that she was able to retain so susceptible a friend as Mademoiselle d’Attichy in spite of numerous other friendships, some of which, especially that with Madame de Longueville, were far from lukewarm—in spite too of a tendency in herself to distrust the affection of others toward her, and to wait for advances rather than to make them. We find many traces of this tendency in the affectionate remonstrances addressed to her by Madame de Longueville, now for shutting herself up from her friends, now for doubting that her letters are acceptable. Here is a little passage from one of these remonstrances which indicates a trait of Madame de Sablé, and is in itself a bit of excellent sense, worthy the consideration of lovers and friends in general: “I am very much afraid that if I leave to you the care of letting me know when I can see you, I shall be a long time without having that pleasure, and that nothing will incline you to procure it me, for I have always observed a certain lukewarmness in your friendship after our explanations, from which I have never seen you thoroughly recover; and that is why I dread explanations, for however good they may be in themselves, since they serve to reconcile people, it must always be admitted, to their shame, that they are at least the effect of a bad cause, and that if they remove it for a time they sometimes leave a certain facility in getting angry again, which, without diminishing friendship, renders its intercourse less agreeable. It seems to me that I find all this in your behavior to me; so I am not wrong in sending to know if you wish to have me to-day.” It is clear that Madame de Sablé was far from having what Sainte-Beuve calls the one fault of Madame Necker—absolute perfection. A certain exquisiteness in her physical and moral nature was, as we shall see, the source of more than one weakness, but the perception of these weaknesses, which is indicated in Madame de Longueville’s letters, heightens our idea of the attractive qualities which notwithstanding drew from her, at the sober age of forty, such expressions as these: “I assure you that you are the person in all the world whom it would be most agreeable to me to see, and there is no one whose intercourse is a ground of truer satisfaction to me. It is admirable that at all times, and amidst all changes, the taste for your society remains in me; and, if one ought to thank God for the joys which do not tend to salvation, I should thank him with all my heart for having preserved that to me at a time in which he has taken away from me all others.”</p><p>Since we have entered on the chapter of Madame de Sablé’s weaknesses, this is the place to mention what was the subject of endless raillery from her friends—her elaborate precaution about her health, and her dread of infection, even from diseases the least communicable. Perhaps this anxiety was founded as much on æsthetic as on physical grounds, on disgust at the details of illness as much as on dread of suffering: with a cold in the head or a bilious complaint, the exquisite précieuse must have been considerably less conscious of being “the ornament of the world,” and “made to be adored.” Even her friendship, strong as it was, was not strong enough to overcome her horror of contagion; for when Mademoiselle de Bourbon, recently become Madame de Longueville, was attacked by small-pox, Madame de Sablé for some time had not courage to visit her, or even to see Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, who was assiduous in her attendance on the patient. A little correspondence à propos of these circumstances so well exhibits the graceful badinage in which the great ladies of that day were adepts, that we are attempted to quote one short letter. </p><p>“Mlle. de Rambouillet to the Marquise de Sablé.” </p><p>“Mlle. de Chalais (dame de compagnie to the Marquise) will please to read this letter to Mme. la Marquise, out of a draught. </p><p>“Madame, I do not think it possible to begin my treaty with you too early, for I am convinced that between the first proposition made to me that I should see you, and the conclusion, you will have so many reflections to make, so many physicians to consult, and so many fears to surmount, that I shall have full leisure to air myself. The conditions which I offer to fulfil for this purpose are, not to visit you until I have been three days absent from the Hôtel de Condé (where Mme. de Longueville was ill), to choose a frosty day, not to approach you within four paces, not to sit down on more than one seat. You may also have a great fire in your room, burn juniper in the four corners, surround yourself with imperial vinegar, with rue and wormwood. If you can feel yourself safe under these conditions, without my cutting off my hair, I swear to you to execute them religiously; and if you want examples to fortify you, I can tell you that the Queen consented to see M. Chaudebonne, when he had come directly from Mme. de Bourbon’s room, and that Mme. d’Aiguillon, who has good taste in such matters, and is free from reproach on these points, has just sent me word that if I did not go to see her she would come to me.” </p><p>Madame de Sablé betrays in her reply that she winces under this raillery, and thus provokes a rather severe though polite rejoinder, which, added to the fact that Madame de Longueville is convalescent, rouses her courage to the pitch of paying the formidable visit. Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, made aware through their mutual friend Voiture, that her sarcasm has cut rather too deep, winds up the matter by writing that very difficult production a perfectly conciliatory yet dignified apology. Peculiarities like this always deepen with age, and accordingly, fifteen years later, we find Madame D’Orleans in her “Princesse de Paphlagonia”—a romance in which she describes her court, with the little quarrels and other affairs that agitated it—giving the following amusing picture, or rather caricature, of the extent to which Madame de Sablé carried her pathological mania, which seems to have been shared by her friend the Countess de Maure (Mademoiselle d’Attichy). In the romance, these two ladies appear under the names of Princesse Parthénie and the Reine de Mionie.</p><p>“There was not an hour in the day in which they did not confer together on the means of avoiding death, and on the art of rendering themselves immortal. Their conferences did not take place like those of other people; the fear of breathing an air which was too cold or too warm, the dread lest the wind should be too dry or too moist—in short, the imagination that the weather might not be as temperate as they thought necessary for the preservation of their health, caused them to write letters from one room to the other. It would be extremely fortunate if these notes could be found, and formed into a collection. I am convinced that they would contain rules for the regimen of life, precautions even as to the proper time for applying remedies, and also remedies which Hippocrates and Galen, with all their science, never heard of. Such a collection would be very useful to the public, and would be highly profitable to the faculties of Paris and Montpellier. If these letters were discovered, great advantages of all kinds might be derived from them, for they were princesses who had nothing mortal about them but the knowledge that they were mortal. In their writings might be learned all politeness in style, and the most delicate manner of speaking on all subjects. There is nothing with which they were not acquainted; they knew the affairs of all the States in the world, through the share they had in all the intrigues of its private members, either in matters of gallantry, as in other things, on which their advice was necessary; either to adjust embroilments and quarrels, or to excite them, for the sake of the advantages which their friends could derive from them;—in a word, they were persons through whose hands the secrets of the whole world had to pass. The Princess Parthénie (Mme. de Sablé) had a palate as delicate as her mind; nothing could equal the magnificence of the entertainments she gave; all the dishes were exquisite, and her cleanliness was beyond all that could be imagined. It was in their time that writing came into use; previously nothing was written but marriage contracts, and letters were never heard of; thus it is to them that we owe a practice so convenient in intercourse.” </p><p>Still later in 1669, when the most uncompromising of the Port Royalists seemed to tax Madame de Sablé with lukewarmness that she did not join them at Port-Royal-des-Champs, we find her writing to the stern M. de Sévigny: “En vérité, je crois que je ne pourrois mieux faire que de tout quitter et de m’en aller là. Mais que deviendroient ces frayeurs de n’avoir pas de médicines à choisir, ni de chirurgien pour me saigner?” </p><p>Mademoiselle, as we have seen, hints at the love of delicate eating, which many of Madame de Sablé’s friends numbered among her foibles, especially after her religious career had commenced. She had a genius in friandise, and knew how to gratify the palate without offending the highest sense of refinement. Her sympathetic nature showed itself in this as in other things; she was always sending bonnes bouches to her friends, and trying to communicate to them her science and taste in the affairs of the table. Madame de Longueville, who had not the luxurious tendencies of her friend, writes: “Je vous demande au nom de Dieu, que vous ne me prépariez aucun ragoût. Surtout ne me donnez point de festin. Au nom de Dieu, qu’il n’y ait rien que ce qu’on peut manger, car vous savez que c’est inutile pour moi; de plus j’en ai scrupule.” But other friends had more appreciation of her niceties. Voiture thanks her for her melons, and assures her that they are better than those of yesterday; Madame de Choisy hopes that her ridicule of Jansenism will not provoke Madame de Sablé to refuse her the receipt for salad; and La Rochefoucauld writes: “You cannot do me a greater charity than to permit the bearer of this letter to enter into the mysteries of your marmalade and your genuine preserves, and I humbly entreat you to do everything you can in his favor. If I could hope for two dishes of those preserves, which I did not deserve to eat before, I should be indebted to you all my life.” For our own part, being as far as possible from fraternizing with those spiritual people who convert a deficiency into a principle, and pique themselves on an obtuse palate as a point of superiority, we are not inclined to number Madame de Sablé’s friandise among her defects. M. Cousin, too, is apologetic on this point. He says:</p><p>“It was only the excess of a delicacy which can be really understood, and a sort of fidelity to the character of précieuse. As the précieuse did nothing according to common usage, she could not dine like another. We have cited a passage from Mme. de Motteville, where Mme. de Sablé is represented in her first youth at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, maintaining that woman is born to be an ornament to the world, and to receive the adoration of men. The woman worthy of the name ought always to appear above material wants, and retain, even in the most vulgar details of life, something distinguished and purified. Eating is a very necessary operation, but one which is not agreeable to the eye. Mme. de Sablé insisted on its being conducted with a peculiar cleanliness. According to her it was not every woman who could with impunity be at table in the presence of a lover; the first distortion of the face, she said, would be enough to spoil all. Gross meals made for the body merely ought to be abandoned to bourgeoises, and the refined woman should appear to take a little nourishment merely to sustain her, and even to divert her, as one takes refreshments and ices. Wealth did not suffice for this: a particular talent was required. Mme. de Sablé was a mistress in this art. She had transported the aristocratic spirit, and the genre précieux, good breeding and good taste, even into cookery. Her dinners, without any opulence, were celebrated and sought after.” </p><p>It is quite in accordance with all this that Madame de Sablé should delight in fine scents, and we find that she did; for being threatened, in her Port Royal days, when she was at an advanced age, with the loss of smell, and writing for sympathy and information to Mère Agnès, who had lost that sense early in life, she receives this admonition from the stern saint: “You would gain by this loss, my very dear sister, if you made use of it as a satisfaction to God, for having had too much pleasure in delicious scents.” Scarron describes her as </p><p>“La non pareille Bois-Dauphine, </p><p>Entre dames perle très fine,” </p><p>and the superlative delicacy implied by this epithet seems to have belonged equally to her personal habits, her affections, and her intellect. </p><p>Madame de Sablé’s life, for anything we know, flowed on evenly enough until 1640, when the death of her husband threw upon her the care of an embarrassed fortune. She found a friend in Réné de Longueil, Seigneur de Maisons, of whom we are content to know no more than that he helped Madame de Sablé to arrange her affairs, though only by means of alienating from her family the estate of Sablé, that his house was her refuge during the blockade of Paris in 1649, and that she was not unmindful of her obligations to him, when, subsequently, her credit could be serviceable to him at court. In the midst of these pecuniary troubles came a more terrible trial—the loss of her favorite son, the brave and handsome Guy de Laval, who, after a brilliant career in the campaigns of Condé, was killed at the siege of Dunkirk, in 1646, when scarcely four-and-twenty. The fine qualities of this young man had endeared him to the whole army, and especially to Condé, had won him the hand of the Chancellor Séguire’s daughter, and had thus opened to him the prospect of the highest honors. His loss seems to have been the most real sorrow of Madame de Sablé’s life. Soon after followed the commotions of the Fronde, which put a stop to social intercourse, and threw the closest friends into opposite ranks. According to Lenet, who relies on the authority of Gourville, Madame de Sablé was under strong obligations to the court, being in the receipt of a pension of 2000 crowns; at all events, she adhered throughout to the Queen and Mazarin, but being as far as possible from a fierce partisan, and given both by disposition and judgment to hear both sides of the question, she acted as a conciliator, and retained her friends of both parties. The Countess de Maure, whose husband was the most obstinate of frondeurs, remained throughout her most cherished friend, and she kept up a constant correspondence with the lovely and intrepid heroine of the Fronde, Madame de Longueville. Her activity was directed to the extinction of animosities, by bringing about marriages between the Montagues and Capulets of the Fronde—between the Prince de Condé, or his brother, and the niece of Mazarin, or between the three nieces of Mazarin and the sons of three noblemen who were distinguished leaders of the Fronde. Though her projects were not realized, her conciliatory position enabled her to preserve all her friendships intact, and when the political tempest was over, she could assemble around her in her residence, in the Place Royal, the same society as before. Madame de Sablé was now approaching her twelfth lustrum, and though the charms of her mind and character made her more sought after than most younger women, it is not surprising that, sharing as she did in the religious ideas of her time, the concerns of “salvation” seemed to become pressing. A religious retirement, which did not exclude the reception of literary friends or the care for personal comforts, made the most becoming frame for age and diminished fortune. Jansenism was then to ordinary Catholicism what Puseyism is to ordinary Church of Englandism in these days—it was a récherché form of piety unshared by the vulgar; and one sees at once that it must have special attractions for the précieuse. Madame de Sablé, then, probably about 1655 or ’56, determined to retire to Port Royal, not because she was already devout, but because she hoped to become so; as, however, she wished to retain the pleasure of intercourse with friends who were still worldly, she built for herself a set of apartments at once distinct from the monastery and attached to it. Here, with a comfortable establishment, consisting of her secretary, Dr. Valant, Mademoiselle de Chalais, formerly her dame de compagnie, and now become her friend; an excellent cook; a few other servants, and for a considerable time a carriage and coachman; with her best friends within a moderate distance, she could, as M. Cousin says, be out of the noise of the world without altogether forsaking it, preserve her dearest friendships, and have before her eyes edifying examples—“vaquer enfin à son aise aux soins de son salut et à ceux de sa santé.”</p><p>We have hitherto looked only at one phase of Madame de Sablé’s character and influence—that of the précieuse. But she was much more than this: she was the valuable, trusted friend of noble women and distinguished men; she was the animating spirit of a society, whence issued a new form of French literature; she was the woman of large capacity and large heart, whom Pascal sought to please, to whom Arnauld submitted the Discourse prefixed to his “Logic,” and to whom La Rochefoucauld writes: “Vous savez que je ne crois que vous êtes sur de certains chapitres, et surtout sur les replis da cœur.” The papers preserved by her secretary, Valant, show that she maintained an extensive correspondence with persons of various rank and character; that her pen was untiring in the interest of others; that men made her the depositary of their thoughts, women of their sorrows; that her friends were as impatient, when she secluded herself, as if they had been rival lovers and she a youthful beauty. It is into her ear that Madame de Longueville pours her troubles and difficulties, and that Madame de la Fayette communicates her little alarms, lest young Count de St. Paul should have detected her intimacy with La Rochefoucauld. [53] The few of Madame de Sablé’s letters which survive show that she excelled in that epistolary style which was the specialty of the Hôtel de Rambouillet: one to Madame de Montausier, in favor of M. Périer, the brother-in-law of Pascal, is a happy mixture of good taste and good sense; but among them all we prefer quoting one to the Duchess de la Tremouille. It is light and pretty, and made out of almost nothing, like soap, bubbles.</p><p>“Je croix qu’il n’y a que moi qui face si bien tout le contraire de ce que je veux faire, car il est vrai qu’il n’y a personne que j’honore plus que vous, et j’ai si bien fait qu’il est quasi impossible que vous le puissiez croire. Ce n’estoit pas assez pour vous persuader que je suis indigne de vos bonnes grâces et de votre souvenir que d’avoir manqué fort longtemps à vous écrire; il falloit encore retarder quinze jours à me donner l’honneur de répondre à votre lettre. En vérité, Madame, cela me fait parôitre si coupable, que vers tout autre que vous j’aimeroix mieux l’être en effet que d’entreprendre une chose si difficile qu’ est celle de me justifier. Mais je me sens si innocente dans mon âme, et j’ai tant d’estime, de respect et d’affection pour vous, qu’il me semble que vous devez le connôitre à cent lieues de distance d’ici, encore que je ne vous dise pas un mot. C’est ce que me donne le courage de vous écrire à cette heure, mais non pas ce qui m’en a empêché si longtemps. J’ai commencé, a faillir par force, ayant eu beaucoup de maux, et depuis je l’ai faite par honte, et je vous avoue que si je n’avois à cette heure la confiance que vous m’avez donnée en me rassurant, et celle que je tire de mes propres sentimens pour vous, je n’oserois jamais entreprendre de vous faire souvenir de moi; mais je m’assure que vous oublierez tout, sur la protestation que je vous fais de ne me laisser plus endurcir en mes fautes et de demeurer inviolablement, Madame, votre, etc.” </p><p>Was not the woman, who could unite the ease and grace indicated by this letter, with an intellect that men thought worth consulting on matters of reasoning and philosophy, with warm affections, untiring activity for others, no ambition as an authoress, and an insight into confitures and ragoûts, a rare combination? No wonder that her salon at Port Royal was the favorite resort of such women as Madame de la Fayette, Madame de Montausier, Madame de Longueville, and Madame de Hautefort; and of such men as Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Nicole, and Domat. The collections of Valant contain papers which show what were the habitual subjects of conversation in this salon. Theology, of course, was a chief topic; but physics and metaphysics had their turn, and still more frequently morals, taken in their widest sense. There were “Conferences on Calvinism,” of which an abstract is preserved. When Rohault invented his glass tubes to serve for the barometrical experiments in which Pascal had roused a strong interest, the Marquis de Sourdis entertained the society with a paper entitled “Why Water Mounts in a Glass Tube.” Cartesianism was an exciting topic here, as well as everywhere else in France; it had its partisans and opponents, and papers were read containing “Thoughts on the Opinions of M. Descartes.” These lofty matters were varied by discussions on love and friendship, on the drama, and on most of the things in heaven and earth which the philosophy of that day dreamt of. Morals—generalizations on human affections, sentiments, and conduct—seem to have been the favorite theme; and the aim was to reduce these generalizations to their briefest form of expression, to give them the epigrammatic turn which made them portable in the memory. This was the specialty of Madame de Sablé’s circle, and was, probably, due to her own tendency. As the Hôtel de Rambouillet was the nursery of graceful letter-writing, and the Luxembourg of “portraits” and “characters,” so Madame de Sablé’s salon fostered that taste for the sententious style, to which we owe, probably, some of the best Pensées of Pascal, and certainly, the “Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld. Madame de Sablé herself wrote maxims, which were circulated among her friends; and, after her death, were published by the Abbé d’Ailly. They have the excellent sense and nobility of feeling which we should expect in everything of hers; but they have no stamp of genius or individual character: they are, to the “Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld, what the vase moulded in dull, heavy clay is to the vase which the action of fire has made light, brittle, and transparent. She also wrote a treatise on Education, which is much praised by La Rochefoucauld and M. d’Andilly; but which seems no longer to be found: probably it was not much more elaborate than her so-called “Treatise on Friendship,” which is but a short string of maxims. Madame de Sablé’s forte was evidently not to write herself, but to stimulate others to write; to show that sympathy and appreciation which are as genial and encouraging as the morning sunbeams. She seconded a man’s wit with understanding—one of the best offices which womanly intellect has rendered to the advancement of culture; and the absence of originality made her all the more receptive toward the originality of others.</p><p>The manuscripts of Pascal show that many of the Pensées, which are commonly supposed to be raw materials for a great work on religion, were remodelled again and again, in order to bring them to the highest degree of terseness and finish, which would hardly have been the case if they had only been part of a quarry for a greater production. Thoughts, which are merely collected as materials, as stones out of which a building is to be erected, are not cut into facets, and polished like amethysts or emeralds. Since Pascal was from the first in the habit of visiting Madame de Sablé, at Port Royal, with his sister, Madame Périer (who was one of Madame de Sablé’s dearest friends), we may well suppose that he would throw some of his jewels among the large and small coin of maxims, which were a sort of subscription money there. Many of them have an epigrammatical piquancy, which was just the thing to charm a circle of vivacious and intelligent women: they seem to come from a La Rochefoucauld who has been dipped over again in philosophy and wit, and received a new layer. But whether or not Madame de Sablé’s influence served to enrich the Pensées of Pascal, it is clear that but for her influence the “Maxims” of La Rochefoucauld would never have existed. Just as in some circles the effort is, who shall make the best puns (horibile dictu!), or the best charades, in the salon of Port Royal the amusement was to fabricate maxims. La Rochefoucauld said, “L’envie de faire des maximes se gagne comme la rhume.” So far from claiming for himself the initiation of this form of writing, he accuses Jacques Esprit, another habitué of Madame de Sablé’s salon, of having excited in him the taste for maxims, in order to trouble his repose. The said Esprit was an academician, and had been a frequenter of the Hôtel de Rambouillet. He had already published “Maxims in Verse,” and he subsequently produced a book called “La Faussete des Vertus Humaines,” which seems to consist of Rochefoucauldism become flat with an infusion of sour Calvinism. Nevertheless, La Rochefoucauld seems to have prized him, to have appealed to his judgment, and to have concocted maxims with him, which he afterward begs him to submit to Madame Sablé. He sends a little batch of maxims to her himself, and asks for an equivalent in the shape of good eatables: “Voilà tout ce que j’ai de maximes; mais comme je ne donne rien pour rien, je vous demande un potage aux carottes, un ragoût de mouton,” etc. The taste and the talent enhanced each other; until, at last, La Rochefoucauld began to be conscious of his pre-eminence in the circle of maxim-mongers, and thought of a wider audience. Thus grew up the famous “Maxims,” about which little need be said. Every at once is now convinced, or professes to be convinced, that, as to form, they are perfect, and that as to matter, they are at once undeniably true and miserably false; true as applied to that condition of human nature in which the selfish instincts are still dominant, false if taken as a representation of all the elements and possibilities of human nature. We think La Rochefoucauld himself wavered as to their universality, and that this wavering is indicated in the qualified form of some of the maxims; it occasionally struck him that the shadow of virtue must have a substance, but he had never grasped that substance—it had never been present to his consciousness. </p><p>It is curious to see La Rochefoucauld’s nervous anxiety about presenting himself before the public as an author; far from rushing into print, he stole into it, and felt his way by asking private opinions. Through Madame de Sablé he sent manuscript copies to various persons of taste and talent, both men and women, and many of the written opinions which he received in reply are still in existence. The women generally find the maxims distasteful, but the men write approvingly. These men, however, are for the most part ecclesiastics, who decry human nature that they may exalt divine grace. The coincidence between Augustinianism or Calvinism, with its doctrine of human corruption, and the hard cynicism of the maxims, presents itself in quite a piquant form in some of the laudatory opinions on La Rochefoucauld. One writer says: “On ne pourroit faire une instruction plus propre à un catechumène pour convertir à Dieu son esprit et sa volonté . . . Quand il n’y auroit que cet escrit au monde et l’Evangile je voudrois etre chretien. L’un m’apprendroit à connoistre mes misères, et l’autre à implorer mon libérateur.” Madame de Maintenon sends word to La Rochefoucauld, after the publication of his work, that the “Book of Job” and the “Maxims” are her only reading.</p><p>That Madame de Sablé herself had a tolerably just idea of La Rochefoucauld’s character, as well as of his maxims, may be gathered not only from the fact that her own maxims are as full of the confidence in human goodness which La Rochefoucauld wants, as they are empty of the style which he possesses, but also from a letter in which she replies to the criticisms of Madame de Schomberg. “The author,” she says, “derived the maxim on indolence from his own disposition, for never was there so great an indolence as his, and I think that his heart, inert as it is, owes this defect as much to his idleness as his will. It has never permitted him to do the least action for others; and I think that, amid all his great desires and great hopes, he is sometimes indolent even on his own behalf.” Still she must have felt a hearty interest in the “Maxims,” as in some degree her foster-child, and she must also have had considerable affection for the author, who was lovable enough to those who observed the rule of Helvetius, and expected nothing from him. She not only assisted him, as we have seen, in getting criticisms, and carrying out the improvements suggested by them, but when the book was actually published she prepared a notice of it for the only journal then existing—the Journal des Savants. This notice was originally a brief statement of the nature of the work, and the opinions which had been formed for and against it, with a moderate eulogy, in conclusion, on its good sense, wit, and insight into human nature. But when she submitted it to La Rochefoucauld he objected to the paragraph which stated the adverse opinion, and requested her to alter it. She, however, was either unable or unwilling to modify her notice, and returned it with the following note: </p><p>“Je vous envoie ce que j’ai pu tirer de ma teste pour mettre dans le Journal des Savants. J’y ai mis cet endroit qui vous est le plus sensible, afin que cela vous fasse surmonter la mauvaise honte qui vous fit mettre la préface sans y rien retrancher, et je n’ai pas craint dele mettre, parce que je suis assurée que vous ne le ferez pas imprimer, quand même le reste vous plairoit. Je vous assure aussi que je vous serai pins obligée, si vous en usez comme d’une chose qui servit à vous pour le corriger on pour le jeter au feu. Nous autres grands auteurs, nous sommes trop riches pour craindre de rien perdre de nos productions. Mandez-moi ce qu’il vous semble de ce dictum.” </p><p>La Rochefoucauld availed himself of this permission, and “edited” the notice, touching up the style, and leaving out the blame. In this revised form it appeared in the Journal des Savants. In some points, we see, the youth of journalism was not without promise of its future. </p><p>While Madame de Sablé was thus playing the literary confidante to La Rochefoucauld, and was the soul of a society whose chief interest was the belles-lettres, she was equally active in graver matters. She was in constant intercourse or correspondence with the devout women of Port Royal, and of the neighboring convent of the Carmelites, many of whom had once been the ornaments of the court; and there is a proof that she was conscious of being highly valued by them in the fact that when the Princess Marie-Madeline, of the Carmelites, was dangerously ill, not being able or not daring to visit her, she sent her youthful portrait to be hung up in the sick-room, and received from the same Mère Agnès, whose grave admonition we have quoted above, a charming note, describing the pleasure which the picture had given in the infirmary of “Notre bonne Mère.” She was interesting herself deeply in the translation of the New Testament, which was the work of Sacy, Arnauld, Nicole, Le Maître, and the Duc de Luynes conjointly, Sacy having the principal share. We have mentioned that Arnauld asked her opinion on the “Discourse” prefixed to his “Logic,” and we may conclude from this that he had found her judgment valuable in many other cases. Moreover, the persecution of the Port Royalists had commenced, and she was uniting with Madame de Longueville in aiding and protecting her pious friends. Moderate in her Jansenism, as in everything else, she held that the famous formulary denouncing the Augustinian doctrine, and declaring it to have been originated by Jansenius, should be signed without reserve, and, as usual, she had faith in conciliatory measures; but her moderation was no excuse for inaction. She was at one time herself threatened with the necessity of abandoning her residence at Port Royal, and had thought of retiring to a religions house at Auteuil, a village near Paris. She did, in fact, pass some summers there, and she sometimes took refuge with her brother, the Commandeur de Souvré, with Madame de Montausier, or Madame de Longueville. The last was much bolder in her partisanship than her friend, and her superior wealth and position enabled her to give the Port Royalists more efficient aid. Arnauld and Nicole resided five years in her house; it was under her protection that the translation of the New Testament was carried on and completed, and it was chiefly through her efforts that, in 1669, the persecution was brought to an end. Madame de Sablé co-operated with all her talent and interest in the same direction; but here, as elsewhere, her influence was chiefly valuable in what she stimulated others to do, rather than in what she did herself. It was by her that Madame de Longueville was first won to the cause of Port Royal; and we find this ardent brave woman constantly seeking the advice and sympathy of her more timid and self-indulgent, but sincere and judicious friend.</p><p>In 1669, when Madame de Sablé had at length rest from these anxieties, she was at the good old age of seventy, but she lived nine years longer—years, we may suppose, chiefly dedicated to her spiritual concerns. This gradual, calm decay allayed the fear of death, which had tormented her more vigorous days; and she died with tranquillity and trust. It is a beautiful trait of these last moments that she desired not to be buried with her family, or even at Port Royal, among her saintly and noble companions—but in the cemetery of her parish, like one of the people, without pomp or ceremony. </p><p>It is worth while to notice, that with Madame de Sablé, as with some other remarkable French women, the part of her life which is richest in interest and results is that which is looked forward to by most of her sex with melancholy as the period of decline. When between fifty and sixty, she had philosophers, wits, beauties, and saints clustering around her; and one naturally cares to know what was the elixir which gave her this enduring and general attraction. We think it was, in a great degree, that well-balanced development of mental powers which gave her a comprehension of varied intellectual processes, and a tolerance for varied forms of character, which is still rarer in women than in men. Here was one point of distinction between her and Madame de Longueville; and an amusing passage, which Sainte-Beuve has disinterred from the writings of the Abbé St. Pierre, so well serves to indicate, by contrast, what we regard as the great charm of Madame de Sablé’s mind, that we shall not be wandering from our subject in quoting it. </p><p>“I one day asked M. Nicole what was the character of Mme. de Longueville’s intellect; he told me it was very subtle and delicate in the penetration of character; but very small, very feeble, and that her comprehension was extremely narrow in matters of science and reasoning, and on all speculations that did not concern matters of sentiment. For example, he added, I one day said to her that I could wager and demonstrate that there were in Paris at least two inhabitants who had the same number of hairs, although I could not point out who these two men were. She told me I could never be sure of it until I had counted the hairs of these two men. Here is my demonstration, I said: I take it for granted that the head which is most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200,000, and the head which is least so has but one hair. Now, if you suppose that 200,000 heads have each a different number of hairs, it necessarily follows that they have each one of the numbers of hairs which form the series from one to 200,000; for if it were supposed that there were two among these 200,000 who had the same number of hairs, I should have gained my wager. Supposing, then, that these 200,000 inhabitants have all a different number of hairs, if I add a single inhabitant who has hairs, and who has not more than 200,000, it necessarily follows that this number of hairs, whatever it may be, will be contained in the series from one to 200,000, and consequently will be equal to the number of hairs on one of the previous 200,000 inhabitants. Now as, instead of one inhabitant more than 200,000, there are nearly 800,000 inhabitants in Paris, you see clearly that there must be many heads which have an equal number of hairs, though I have not counted them. Still Mme. de Longueville could never comprehend that this equality of hairs could be demonstrated, and always maintained that the only way of proving it was to count them.”</p><p>Surely, the most ardent admirer of feminine shallowness must have felt some irritation when he found himself arrested by this dead wall of stupidity, and have turned with relief to the larger intelligence of Madame de Sablé, who was not the less graceful, delicate, and feminine because she could follow a train of reasoning, or interest herself in a question of science. In this combination consisted her pre-eminent charm: she was not a genius, not a heroine, but a woman whom men could more than love—whom they could make their friend, confidante, and counsellor; the sharer, not of their joys and sorrows only, but of their ideas and aims. </p><p>Such was Madame de Sablé, whose name is, perhaps, new to some of our readers, so far does it lie from the surface of literature and history. We have seen, too, that she was only one among a crowd—one in a firmament of feminine stars which, when once the biographical telescope is turned upon them, appear scarcely less remarkable and interesting. Now, if the reader recollects what was the position and average intellectual character of women in the high society of England during the reigns of James the First and the two Charleses—the period through which Madame de Sablé’s career extends—we think he will admit our position as to the early superiority of womanly development in France, and this fact, with its causes, has not merely an historical interest: it has an important bearing on the culture of women in the present day. Women become superior in France by being admitted to a common fund of ideas, to common objects of interest with men; and this must ever be the essential condition at once of true womanly culture and of true social well-being. We have no faith in feminine conversazioni, where ladies are eloquent on Apollo and Mars; though we sympathize with the yearning activity of faculties which, deprived of their proper material, waste themselves in weaving fabrics out of cobwebs. Let the whole field of reality be laid open to woman as well as to man, and then that which is peculiar in her mental modification, instead of being, as it is now, a source of discord and repulsion between the sexes, will be found to be a necessary complement to the truth and beauty of life. Then we shall have that marriage of minds which alone can blend all the hues of thought and feeling in one lovely rainbow of promise for the harvest of human happiness. </p><p>THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL OF MUSIC. </p><p>LISZT ON MEYERBEER--WAGNER. </p><p>Weimer, Oct. 1. </p><p>It has been my duty and my pleasure several times in this journal to raise my voice against Meyerbeer and his school; which may have something to do with the selection of the subject for the third letter. I am glad to have Liszt fighting in the same ranks, although he fights under another standard. My opinion has always been that Mayerbeer's unmistakable ability and knowledge of theatrical effect have given his works a popularity which fo a time may cast, in the shade the music of far deeper and more enduring character, just as the popularity of a Dumas may for a time eclipse Racine; but whatever we may think of Meyerbeer's theatrical talent, his musical genius is of quit a secondary order. Instead of Music he has striven for Situation; instead of Poetry, Effect. To bring stage pomp, splendour, dance, and the clang of tumultuous orchestras, as a substitution for passionate and melodic expression, was an innovation indeed, but no real reform. The primary aim of the musical Art was given up in favour of a secondary and accessory aim of stage effect. </p><p>Such briefly, was the point of view taken. In Liszt's criticism I find perfect agreement with these ideas, except that he regards Meyerbeer's innovation as a real reform, a transition from a worn-out form of Art to a newer and grander form. Rossini--il maestro di color che sonno--the greatest dramatic genius, as I conceive, who even used. Music as a form of expression, Liszt regards as the culmination of that style which aimed at Feeling above all things, careless of dramatic propriety, careless of character, truth, on couleur locale. Meyerbeer, on the other hand, is regardless of the mere melodie delight, and thinks mainly of Effect. Let us see how Liszt establishes this by an historical survey of the development of modern Opera. </p><p>He very properly brings into its deserved prominence the part which the libretto playes in Opera. Thus, he says, among all the libretto-writers of the last century, the one who won a lasting celebrity was Metastasio. He was the poet par excellence of that Italian opera of which we may take Hasee as the most typical representative. Though not so fertile as some other composers of his time, Hasse produced more than fifty operas, which will not appear surprising if we reflect that in that day every musical author held it quite natural to compose several operas to the same text, and vice versa. This fact is a significant proof of the then existing indifference to effects which are appropriate to specific situtations; for these are not transferable, whereas the same feeling may be expressed in a hundred ways, and it is easy to adapt a new melody to words, or new words to a melody, if both the one and the other simply express joy, sorrow, or love in general, and if no great weight is laid on declamation and prosody, which are the sole indissoluble bond between words and musical expression. Thus, during the first epoch of the Opera, the expression of feeling was the dominant tendency. In the beginning of the present century the society whose favourite poet was Metastasio, and whose favourite musician was Hasse, had disappeared. New social conditions demanded a new form of art. Already, in Don Giovanni and Il Flauto Magico, new elements are observable; tragic horror alternates with comedy, evidently for the sake of avoiding the uniformity of the sentimental fustian and bombast which were then inseparable from the opera seria. The signal once given, everything was sought that could introduce variety into the libretto, and the distinction between the opera seria and teh opera buffa was obliterated in favour  of the operra mezza carattere. Antiquity, the middle ages, romances, the poetical incidents of modern history, even anecdote, were ransacked for themes that admitted of amplifications, variations, and accessories; and this was done without any system, as in the case of transitional works, which, while they depart from the old form, do not fully bear the stamp of the new. When Scribe wrote Robert le Diable it was evident that even in the lifetime of Rossinni, the most illustrious master of the old school, a new period in the conceptions of opera subjects had throroughly set in. Rossini had more than parried the effect of Auber's Masaniello by producing William Tell, but when Robert appeared he left Paris, conscious that the school, of which he was the head, had received a blow which sooner or later must be fatal. The expression of feeling in arias, duettos, and finales, which called forth no pregnant dramatic crisis, ceased to be the basis of an opera. The demand was the situations. This element was not entirely novel; instinctively it had already been striven for. The inauguration of a new period in the opera through Scribe's Robert and Meyerbeer's musical conception of it, presented nothing unheard of, or unprecedented. In art, as in nature, no species stands in isolation--it is always united by intermediate links with species of a different or even opposite form. There had been the hell-flames in Don Giovanni, the explosion of the fleet in Cortez, the hammer and anvil chorus in Alcidor, the burning Vesuvius and the tumultuous scenes in Masaniello, the popular insurrection and the glowing Alps in William Tell, the terrors of the Wolf Ravine in Der Freischutz. But Scribe, surpassed all, making that a main object which had previously been only an accessory. Splendour of decoration, profusion of scenic arrangement, marvellous ballets, supernatural machinery, in short, spectacular magnificence, ceased to be adjuncts and became an integral element, an organic part of every operatic work, since they were essential to the interest and artisitc effect of the situations. Simultaneously arose the necessity for developing new resources in the orchestra and chorus, if they were not to be annihilated or reduced to the second rank by scenic splendour. From this time it was an absolute requisite in every opera that there should be some grand spectacle in the most thrilling moment, as a sort of climax to the situations. The dance of the phantoms in Robert was succeeded by the crowd of horses in La Juive, and this again by the fabulous wonders of teh Juif Errant and L'Enfant Prodigue, till at last it seems as if the force of decoration can not further go. Scribe, like a man of talent as he is, did not use half measures; he laid hor on situations wherever he could find them, and being in no dread of absurdity, he won the game. His name will be inseparable from the second period of the opera, less fertile that the first, but more important from the intinsic value of its productions. The school of which Metastasio was the chief poet, was adapted to a period and to courts in which effeminate, insipid refinement reigned;</p><p>Scribe, on the contrary, belongs to an epoch in which exaggeration was the order of the day. Romanticism was then in full bloom, and French poetry was still under the influence of Byron and Hoffman. The public accustomed to horrors, could hardly be made to shudder by the most startling contrasts. Victor Hugo created chaste courtesans, devoted mothers, and artistic poisoners in one and teh same person; Nodier paraded with his Jean Shogar; beautiful countesses and duchesses were enamoured of the heroes in Eugene Sue's Salamander, and gave their approval to Dorval, in Dumas' Antony. Extravagance was asked for at any price. Hatred and love, terrific dangers and ineffable bliss, the brightest light and the darkest shade were placed in juxtaposition. Scribe crowned all in his Robert by making Satan himself a tender father. It would be difficult now to bring forward such a sentimental devil, but at the time when Robert appeared it was precisely this extravagance which made its fortune. The different relation which the libretto bears to the music in the first and second periods of the opera is strongly indicated by the fact that though Rossini applied himself to the creation of nearly forty operas, no one cares to know the author on any one of his librettos, whereas the name of Scribe is indissolubly bound to that of Meyerbeer. In that form of the opera which they have jointly brought to its culminating point, they have made love merely an episode, if order to step out of the narrow circle of simple, individual feeling, and to multiply dramatic motives which may give rise to an abundance of striking situations. Simple melody is superseded by combinations of musical effect, the expression of feeling has given way to situation. There must be had at whatever cost, and it must be admitted that in pursuit of them the interest and the truthful presentation of character are often left unregarded though not so entirely as critics are now wont to allege. It is true enough that the character of Robert has no sort of self-subsistence, that Isabella is but a voice, Bertram falsely drawn, and the Prophet erroneously conceived, Bertha a nullity, and Fides a failure; but on the other hand, Alice--the pure pious country maiden, who rescues the son of her benefactress from hellish snares, not out of egotisitic love, but out of divine compassion and child-like obedience--and Marcel, who presents the same kind of self-devotion in a severer form, are true characters and noble creations. And if Scribe is to be reproached for his love of situations, he knows how to select impressive ones, witness the fourth act of the Huguenots.</p><p>It is undeniable that Scribe and Meyerbeer have made a great step towards teh complete union of musical and poetical requirements on the stage, towards the conversion of the opera into a real musical drama. They have given a necessary prelude to the position maintained by the new operatic schools, namely--that the moment is come in which the poetry of opera-texts should have more elements of teh tragedy and recited drama than hitherto; that all the splendours of scenery can be applied to heighten the interest of situations without sacrificing the indispensable poetical features of the drama. The first period of teh opera, of which Rossini is the greatest representative, had for its aim the expression of feeling; the second period, represented by Meyerbeer, has striven after situations and musical effects; the third period, inaugurated by the operas of Wagner, seeks to ally situations with character. Wagner saw that in striving for situations the operatic author was in danger of neglecting tragical requisites and beauties; whereas the presentation of characters and tehir mutual relations necessarily evolved situations. He does not, like Scribe, combine situations as external events; he makes them spring out of the passions which heave in the bosom of man, out of the impulses which determine the nature of his joys and griefs. In the first scene of Trannha ser, it is the will of man which, inasmuch as he breaks loose from one feeling and submits to the sway of another, suffices to call forth the marvellous situation. The school of Wagner is at present too young or any opinoin to be pronounced on its future destiny, on the excellences which constitute its greatness, or the faults which will ultimately bring about its decline. For Art never stands still, but lives under successive forms as under so many tents, which are pitched and taken down again on the path to the Ideal. But even now, at the very rise of this school, there is ground for maintaining that it has become impossible any longer to create and carry out enduring works on the model of Scribe and Meyerbeet. The presentation of character, that first condition of perfection in tragedy, will henceforth be a necessity for the musical drama also. And this element makes the regeneration and creation of a declamatory style indispensable. Character manifests itself on the stage by words as well as actions; hence Wagner lays so much stress on the intrinsic beauty of the operatic poem. Gl ck lent to dramatic music all the lustre, majesty, and weight of the declamatory style, while Piccini held to the old faith, the main article of which was, that melodic expression sufficed for the rendering of feeling. Picini appeared to have the advantage, and to carry general opinion with him, but Gl ck has planted the standard of a principle which was destined to be triumphant. In the mena time Rossini appeared like a meteor, and won all sympathies, escpecially those of the elegant world, to the old form of opers. Then, at a moment when the melodic and declamatory style stood in opposition, came Meyerbeer and combined the two; without rejecting melody, he gave declamation an important share in the merit of his works. Wagner has gone a step further, and so far from making melody an object, he rather rejoices when the melodic motives, which are treated by him in a declamatory and specially dramatic manner, are denied the name of melodies. </p><p>This is Liszt's point of view, which, in the historic scheme he sets forth, gives to Meyerbeer a far higher significance than I am disposed to grant. But for the present you may content yourself with Liszt's ingenious history, and the position which, according to him, Wagner is to fill in the history of art. In some future letter I may be able to say more of Wagner.</p><p>THE ART OF THE ANCIENTS. </p><p>Torso. Kunst, Kunstler, und Kunstwerke der Alten. Von Adolf Stahr. In Zwei Theilen. Erster Theil. [Torso. The Art, Artists, and Art-Remains of the Ancients. In Two Parts. First Part. By Adolf Stahr.] </p><p>Brunswick: Vieweg and Son. </p><p>THE books of which a reviewer can say that he has read every word, and has laid them down wishing for more, are far from being as plentiful as blackberries, especially in German literature. Professor Stahr's Torso, however, is one of these exceptional books: we have read it from beginning to end with delight, and are eager for the second part, which is yet to appear. The name of Adolf Stahr is well known in Germany, and not unknown in England, as that of a writer who unites thorough scholarship with refined taste, and who has that rare mastery of the unwieldy German language which makes his works charm by their form as well as their matter. There is not a trace of pedantry in his books; you perceive his knowledge as you perceive the daylight, by the clearness with which objects are presented to you. He has written a work on Aristotle, to which scholars give a high rank; but his Weimar und Jena may be read with pleasure by the idlest young lady, and his Jahr in Italien is a favourite companion of artistic travellers. His pre-eminent talent lies in description both of natural scenery and works of art; he has not only an intense susceptibility to the beautiful, but he is in possession of the magic word which will convey his impression to the mind of the reader. These excellent qualities are remarkably exhibited in his latest and yet uncompleted work, the title of which we have given above. It is more historical and descriptive than disquisitional; condensed enough to serve as an introductory manual for those who have the opportunity of immediately studyinq ancient sculpture, and yet so full and vivid in its descriptions, and so philosophic in its mode of considering the development of art, that it may be read with lively interest in a country town, far away from all casts and museums. To any one who is not already very wise on Greek art, and who is so happy as to have time and opportunity to study its original remains, or, what is next best, to go to the Crystal Palace, we recommend Professor Stahr's book. It will not tell him every thing, but it will do him the greater service of creating a thirst for more knowledge than it conveys. </p><p>The early chapters are occupied with the consideration of the physical geography of Greece and the characteristics of the Greek races, their religion and political institutions, as bearing on the development of art. A chapter on Daedalus, the mythic father of Greek art, whom tradition connects with Egypt, leads us naturally to the question how far Hellenic art is to be regarded as a purely indigenous, independent product of Greece, or simply as a higher development of oriental art. It is well known that Winckelmann espoused the former opinion, and his authority prevailed among German critics in maintaining a view which is opposed to all analogy and to the direct evidence furnished by oriental and Greek remains, long after it had been given up by English, French, and Italian investigators of the highest rank. It is a fact characteristic of our good friends the Germans (who, something like those Fakirs that seek for the divine light by perpetually contemplating the end of their noses, generally predetermine what things must be in their studies, and think it an idle business to inquire what things are), that when Ludwig Ross, a distinguished traveller and critic, after diligently investigating the remains of art in the countries round the Levant, enunciated the opinion that the social, religious, and artistic culture of Greece could not be understood apart from the supposition that the Greeks had been influenced by the culture of earlier peoples, he was contemptuously decried as a "Tourist." Of course, a man who had looked at the fact must be incapacitated for forming the reine Idee. But a truer spirit of investigation has arisen among the German critics of the last thirty years, and men such as Creuzer, Thiersch, Bockh, Schorn, and Anselm Feuerbach have recognised the influence of oriental, and especially of Egyptian, art on Greece. "The process of development in culture and art," says Professor Stahr, "is the same as that of natural products and their cultivation by man. Modern botanical research has proved that almost everything which is necessary, useful, and agreeable to us in the vegetable kingdom came in gradual procession from Asia, until it was arrested at the western coast at Europe. And now that after a short rest it has sprung across the Atlantic this propagation pursues its course through America</p><p>towards the West. But the West receives the gifts of the East only to refine the rude, to develop the imperfect, to ennoble the common." </p><p>After general consideration on the progress of Greek art from Daedalus to Phidias, and from Phidias to Hadrian, and on the criteria of relative antiquity, the author commences his descriptive survey of the principle remains of Hellenic sculpture--those remains which best illustrate the ideals of the successive epochs. The Gate of Lions at Mycene, and the reliefs at Samothrace representing Agamemnon seated on a throne accompanied by two herlads, bear strong traces of the abstract Egyptian manner; the one herald, for example, being the repetition of the other. So do the Lycian sculptures, consisting of from sixty to seventy statues in a sitting posture, which formed the avenue to a temple; the perfect parallelism of the feet, the stiff posture of the arms, the straight line of the drapery, everything is Egyptians in style. A yet more important specimen of Greek art, discovered in Sicily about thirty years ago, are the remains of a temple on the citadel of Selinus, a city which was built by Dorian Greeks 608 B.C., and destroyedby the Carthaginians only 200 years later, so that the period of these sculptures is absolutely determined. Here we have an ill-proportioned Hercules carrying a couple of his tormentors slung on a pole over his shoulder, and Perseus, protected by Minerva, slaying Medusa. The upper part of all the figures is de face, the legs de profil--again an Egyptian fashion. The Medusa is a hideous caricatures; how far from the terrible beauty of the Medusa Rondanini! </p><p>A chapter on temple pediments and their sculptural ornaments introduces the  ginetan sculptures, the originals of which are at Munich, and a cast of which may be seen at the Crystal Palace. They doubtless adorned the temple erected by the wealth  ginetan to Minerva--a temple belonging to the earliest works of Doric architecture, and probably built in the time of Solon, for they were found in the accumulations of rubbish overgrown with brushwood which surrounded its ruin. The remarkable point in these sculptures is the high degree of truthfulness and beauty in the limbs, and the uniformity and utter unmeaningness of the faces. This inequality Stahr regards as teh remains of the earlier hieratic influence, the tendency of which was to keep up traditional and conventional forms; but perhaps he is nearer the true reason when he says, that on comparing the  ginetan sculptures with the works of the early Italian masters, Giotto and Pietro Perugino, we observe a striking difference between them in this respect: the early Italian masters were animated by the spiritualistic idea that the body was but an unworthy dwelling for the immortal soul, and hence they threw all their power into the face, where the soul might be said to look out from its tabernacle; whereas in the conception of the Greeks, a fine body was the primary condition of a fine mind--first the body, and then the soul by and through the body, was the order of their ideas. Hence, in Greek art, the expression of the face would naturally be the last in the order of development.</p><p>The chapters on Phidias and his works, include a survey of the sculptures of the Parthenon (by us modern barbarians called the Elgin marbles), which, alas! are the only works immediately and unquestionably his now remaining; a description of what the Parthenon was in its glory; and the history of its sad fate. It is exasperating to think that after surviving the bigotry of early Christianity, the inroads of northern barbarians, the crusading adventures of the middle ages, who as Dukes of Athens mad the Acropolis their citadel, nay, the Turkish conquest under Omar, the Parthenon was at last, nearly at the end of the seventeenth century, blown into fragments in a siege conducted by Konigsmark, the German general of the Venetian army. The Turkish Pacha had deposited all his treasures and ammunition in the Parthenon, which had hitherto served him as a mosque; a bomb fell into the powder magazine, and the temple, which had stood in its beauty 2000 years, was a heap of ruins! Besides the fragmentary relics of the Parthenon, we possess, as we have said, nothing that can be regarded as the immediate work of Phidias; but we know that the glorious ideals of the Zeus and Athene were of his creation, and the descriptions of his works, which are preserved to us, assure us that, on looking at the Jupiter Otricoli or the Pallas Velletri, we are really looking at a product of the mind of Phidias, even though these may not be direct copies from his works. With Phidias are connected the Colossi on the Monte Cavallo--two groups representing Castor and Pollus, each controlling a restive horse--from the fact that one of them is inscribed with his name, and that Pliny speaks of one of the two naked Colossi "as having been the work of Phidias." The result of the scanty evidence on the subject seems to be that one of the colossal groups is a copy of an original work of Phidias in bronze. The other is inscribed with the name of Praxiteles.</p><p>Next in interest to the remains of the Parthenon are those of the temple of Apollo in the city of Phigalia in Arcadia (the Phigalian marbles in the British Museum) the work of Alkamenes, the pupil of Phidias, and discovered in 1811. The temple itself, with its six-and-thirty marble pillars gleaming through the dark greens of the mountain forests, had been long man artists, and connoisseurs, the only aperture in the heap of ruins and acumulated rubbish which filled the interior to the height of sixteen feet. On looking in, they found that the little animal had made its bed on a splended relief, and after immense labour, twenty-three compartments of the frieze were brought forth to the light: an invaluable addition to the small amount of Greek sculpture, the locality, date, and originality of which are beyond all doubt. </p><p>The two greatest contemporaries of Phidias were Polysletos and Myron. To the former we owe the Juno idea, of which the Juno Ludovisi is the highest presentation, and the conception of Mercury as the Greek youth in the culmination of blended beauty and strength, the Hermes Enagonios, presideing over Pal stra. Myron's genius was more realistic, and was chiefly directed to the reproduction of athletic and gymnatic subjects, and of animal life. The well-known Discobolus is, in all probability, a copy from a bronze original by him. </p><p>To this great triad of sculptors who adorned the age of Pericles, succeeded in the following age, the fourth century B. C., another triad, Scopas, Praxiteles, and Lysippus, whose style Winckelmann characterises as the beautiful in distinction from that of Phidias which as the sublime. In the second period, the severe bronze which had hitherto been the favourite material, gave way to the more life-like marble. To this fact, that the artists of the Phidian age wrought principally in bronze, we must attribute our almost total loss of their productions, metal in every form having been an object of Barbarian greediness. Scopas was one of the most fertile of the ancient masters; he created whole species of ideal beings, as attendants on Bacchus, Neptune, Apollo, and Venus; yet not a single original work of his remains, not even one of the seven which were dragged away to Rome in the days of Greek humiliation. The Mars Ludovisi is probably a copy from an original of his, and he transformed the ideal of the Eumenides, the personified terror of conscience, from the hideousness assigned to it in the earlier poetry and art, into an appalling beauty. Praxiteles, "The Master of Beauty," is the one among all the artists of this age who has been brought nearest to us by the remains of his creations. To him we owe the Venus-ideal of which the Aphrodite of Gniuos was the culmination, the conception of Eros as the lovely youth, the voluptuous beauty of the Bacchus, the graceful strength and freedom of tbe Diana, the benignant repose of the Ceres, and the famous Satyr which an ancient art legend describes him as valuing together with his Eros, above all his other works. Even so early as the time of Pliny, it was doubted whether the great Niobe group, discovered at Rome in 1583, and now at Florence, were the work of Scopas or of Praxiteles. But we at least know that the statue of Niobe, was one of the finest works of Praxi teles, for Greek poetry, which has proved less perishable than Greek sculpture, makes Niobe say: "Me living the Gods turned to stone, but in stone Praxiteles has made me breathe again."</p><p>To the chapter on Praxiteles follows a long and valuable one on the Social Position of the Artist in Greece, and another on the relation between Art and Freedom. Then comes a highly interesting survey of ancient Portrait-sculpture; and finally, this first part of the work closes with the consideration of the Colouring and Nudity of Greek statues. We are glad to find Professor Stahr insisting, that in the highest period of Greek art the colouring of statues was not guided by the barbaric idea of producing illusion, but by a fine sense of relief in colours, an opinion which we have advocated in these columns. </p><p>Our space will not allow us to dwell longer on the contents of this delightful work. Let the readers of German, and the lovers of art, procure it for themselves. </p><p>MEMOIRS OF THE COURT OF AUSTRIA. </p><p>THE </p><p>WESTMINSTER </p><p>AND </p><p>FOREIGN QUARTERLY REVIEW. </p><p>APRIL 1, 1855. </p><p>ART. I.--MEMOIRS OF THE COURT OF AUSTRIA. </p><p>Geschichte des ostreichischen Hofs and Adels und der ostreichischen Diplomatie. Von Dr. Eduard Vehse. (History of the Austrian Court and Aristocracy, and of the Austrian Diplomacy. By Dr. Edward Vehse.) In eleven vols. Hamburgh: Hoffman and Campe. 1851—1853. </p><p>IT is a subject of general complaint among the literary men of Germany, that since 1848 they have no reviews or literary journals by which new books may be made known to the public; and foreigners are constantly wondering by what machinery the multitudinous works which issue from the German press can be made to obtain a remunerative circulation. With regard to some books, however, the censorship supplies this want. It may be considered as a governmental puffing institution, by which insignificant books are made notorious and an apathetic public is roused into curiosity. In the case of works by celebrated authors--Heine’s “Vermischte Schriften,” for example--the censorship is indeed sometimes too tardy in its action to have any appreciable effect as an advertising medium; an eager public has already bought and read the book before the prohibition comes. But the productions of less famous writers often acquire by means of the censorship an interest which they could not possess in any other character than that of forbidden fruit. Nay, the feeblest of feeble epigrams by which an English periodical attempts to satirize the habits of foreign royalty is made the subject of the newsman’s winks and the reader’s curiosity solely by means of this government aid </p><p>[Vol. LXIII. No. CXXIV.]--NEW SERIES, Vol. VII. No. II. X</p><p>Dr. Vehse’s “History of the German Courts since the Reformation”--a work already extendeding to twenty-eight volumes and is not yet complete--has experienced peculiar benefits from the censorship; for several of the German governments have had the naivete to prohibit the volumes relating to their own courts--Ognuno ama la gustizia nella casa d'altrui, says the Italian proverb; in other words, “We all think truth a good thing for our neighbours.” We have no doubt that this partial prohibition has contributed, not indeed mainly but considerably, to the powerful effect which Dr. Vehse’s work is said to have produced in Germany. Few works are sought for with greater avidity by non-literary readers--those readers who trouble themselves little with theories and are strongly acted on by facts; and among them its influence is said to be highly democratic. Yet it is by no means a tendenzschrift--a work in which the materials are arranged with a view to a special inference. We understand that Dr. Vehse himself is no hot democrat, but a moderate liberal; and we must do him the justice to say that, so far as we are acquainted with his volumes, we trace in them no spirit of partisanship. </p><p>Besides the censorship, there are two other causes which we think will serve to explain the popularity of Dr. Vehse’s work. Germany has not, like France, been fertile in memoirs and biographies, which take the reader behind the scenes of history, and show majesty without its wig, or aristocratic beauty with its rouge-pot; nor has it, like England, had ample access to documents which throw light on the secret transactions of kings and ministers. Again, Germany is singularly deficient in that middle stratum of literature which consists of works at once solid and popular, and which is so rich with us. German works are generally written either for the learned or fur Damen--the latter destination unhappily implying a very low standard--either for those who are devoting themselves to a certain line of study with the thoroughness of a professor, or for those who seek nothing higher in their reading than the diversion of an idle moment. Hence any work which addresses itself to intelligent men of the world, and which will instruct without demanding any great intellectual effort or previous acquirement, is doubly welcome to our German neighbours; and Dr. Vehese's work, with all the deductions which may be made on the score of execution, is one of this class. But readers who come to it with recollections of the piquancy of St. Simon or De Grammont, the quaint interest of Pepys, the gossiping charm of Walpole, or the panoramic picturesqueness of Macaulay, will find but slight gratification from its pages. Dr. Vehes pretends to no art in the presenation of his materials; he has chosen the plan of presenting the information he derives from written sources in the language of those sources themselves; and this mosaic of extracts, combined as it is with lists of ministerial, diplomatic, and court officials, necessarily gives his volumes all </p><p>the artistic disadvantages of mere compilations. To those who object to his work that it wants the dignified and careful finish of history, he replies, in the words of Horace Walpole: “I am no </p><p>historian: I draw characters, I preserve anecdotes, which my superiors the historians may enchase in their weighty annals or pass over at their pleasure." Lovers of the anecdotic notoriously use </p><p>rather a coarse sieve in the selection of their materials, and in this respect Dr. Vehse is no exception to the class among whom he ranges himself: moreover he has poured out the contents of his sieve somewhat carelessly upon his pages. We believe, however, that there are no deficiencies or inaccuracies in his work, which can be referred to an uncandid bias, but simply such as arise </p><p>from the more than ordinary fallibility which attaches to a writer who undertakes to present in a comparatively short period a survey of a vast historical field. </p><p>The eleven volumes relating to the Austrian court, of which we have given the title at the head of our article, are forbidden at Vienna, and the author himself, since their publication commenced, has not been allowed to enter the Austrian dominions--a circumstance which he pleads as an apology for the absence from his work of information to be collected only in the archives of Vienna. This prohibition is not surprising. The monarchs of the House of Hapsburg, like the members of other dynasties, show to little advantage when daguerreotyped instead of idealized: and perhaps there is no aristocracy whose antecedents present so much selfishness, venality, and unscrupulousness as that of Austria; no history which unfolds a more hideous course of misgovernment and persecution than that of the Imperial rule in Bohemia and Hungary. The dynastic interest of the House of Austria certainly served to knit together the forces of middle Europe so as to form a bulwark against Turkish invasion on the one hand and French domination on the other; but the details of its operation to this end are an almost unvaried tissue of the worst vices which belong to arbitrary government. Our present object, however, is not to dwell on these vices with any severe purpose, but simply to illustrate--through the medium of such records, anecdotes, and sketches of character and manners, as Dr. Vehse's work affords--the life and personnel of the Austrian court during the last three centuries.</p><p>The reign of Maximilian I., elected Emperor of Germany in 1493, forms a sort of border-land between the middle ages and the period of modern history. Maximilian himself belonged by his tastes and opinions to the past; he was der letzte Ritter--the last knight of chivalry; but under him the right of adjusting private quarrel by force of arms was abolished, hired soldiery superseded the military service of feudal retainers, and the Reformation began. In his day died the iron-handed Gotz and Franz von Sickingen, and he lived to see Luther's ninety-five theses posted up on the church-door at Wittenberg. But Maximilian, in spite of his chivalrous ambition, had, like his ancestor Rudolf, the founder of his dynasty, an anti-chivalrous love of bargaining for possessions rather than fighting for them; and no Hapsburg carried out more diligently than he the sarcastic injunction: Tu feliz Austria, nube! and his achievements of this kind prepared the way for that extensive empire which, under his grandson, Charles V., more than rivalled the possessions of Macedonia and Rome. His own marriage with the heiress of Burgundy brought him the Netherlands, the marriage of his son Philip with Juana of Spain secured the inheritance of the then mighty Spanish empire; and he paved the way by treaty for the possession of Bohemia and Hungary. Max is one of the most bizarre figures in history. Mythical stories, which we may accept as a sort of loud reverberation of the truth, represent him as a Hercules, who could bond iron as if it were hemp; who went into the cage of a lion, wrenched open its mouth, and tore out its tongue; and who (rather gratuitously, as it seems,) went to the summit of the minster at Ulm, and, standing on a thin iron bar, raised one leg into the air. He would play at letting off cannon against practised artillerymen; and was the best bowman, the best shot, the best huntsman of his time. As a specimen of his hunting exploits, we have the famous story of his adventure on the Martinswand in the Tyrol, where he was rescued from imminent death by a mountaineer, alias an angel, after a fast of two days and two nights. He aspired to be, like Charlemagne, the hero of an Epos, dictated his own and his father's history under the title of “Der Weiss Kunig," and gave the scheme for a poem called Thenerdank, which recounted his own exploits. He seems to have busied himself with speculation, too, of a small kind. Two-and-twenty volumes written by him are still preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna, and among their very miscellaneous contents are these questions, which he proposed to the Abbot Trittheim as serious difficulties: “Since Christianity comprehends only a small part of the earth, may not every man who believes in God, without anything further, be saved in his religion? Why is revelation in so many passages obscure, contradictory, and why does it tell us so many things we do not care to know, and not what we should he very glad to know?" Of course Max, as a would-be knight-errant, was a great squire of dames: in his younger days he loved to dance with the wives of the Augsburg citizens, and there is a humorous story of his having smuggled into Ratisbon a body of women whom the magistracy had forbidden to enter during the Diet, by telling the foremost to take hold of his horse's tail, the second to take hold of her first neighbour's garment, and so on to the last, thus forming an electrical chain of lmperial protection. He was full of wise saws and repartees, and many a ban-mot which old-fashioned jest-books attribute to the Duke of Marlborough or one of our own Georges, had Max for at least an earlier putative father. Some of these mots are epigrams on the nothingness of rank, yet no one had a stronger genealogical mania or adopted more sounding titles. He was determined, he said, to “outbrag Julius Ctesar, and at all events to have Charlemagne for his ancestor." To the arms of half-a-dozen European nations he added those of the Byzantine empire, on the ground that “he or his successors would shortly conquer it." He was the “lord of all lands both of the east and of the west," the “king and heir of all Christendom and of several provinces." After the death of his second wife he took it into his head to aspire to the popedom, and spent large sums vin bribing the cardinals with this view. Not that money was abundant with him, for the Imperial exchequer was low then as in later times, and one of his sobriquets was “Poco denari." Max was the first who formed an alliance with Prussia, which had not hitherto been considered a European power, but had recently, under the Czar Ivan Basilowitch, thrown off the Asiatic yoke by the expulsion of the Tartars.</p><p>To the gay eccentric Max, succeeded his grave, stern grandson, Charles V. Of all great potentates who, according to the Persian compliment, have had “the sun for their hat," Charles is to us the least attractive. A hero with a sallow complexion and no teeth, a melancholy debauchee, in whom the demon of gout takes turn with the demon of asthma; a non-masticating gourmand, who in his dyspeptic after-dinner hours amuses himself with dwarfs and court fools; and a bigot withal, plagued with religious terrors, always sinning and always trembling--presents a most uncomfortable sample of Imperial majesty. Charles, however, had some of the elements of greatness--a deep penetration into men, an iron strength of will, and a proud directness, which made him despise flattery. He once said to the Venetian ambassador, Contarini, “It is my nature to persist obstinately in my opinions." “Sire," said the courtly Italian, "to persist in good opinions is firmness, not obstinacy." Charles replied, “Qualche fiate io son fermo in le cattive--sometimes I persist in bad ones." He had an eye for genius of all kinds; and not only, like every other great commander, chose his generals well, but could tell a nobleman to hold the ladder for Titian. One of his physicians was the great Vesalius, the father of modern anatomy, the first who dissected a human body; and it is an interesting example of genius co-operating with genius, that Titian helped Vesalius in producing the illustrations to his great anatomical work. </p><p>There was no profuseness or splendour at Charles's court; he was even niggardly in his economy; his pages went about in threadbare garments, and he himself was seen, at a great military review, to take off his new velvet cap, that he might save it from the rain. He was a Spaniard by nature; and under him began that inoculation of German awkwardness with Spanish hauteur, which characterized the manners of the Austrian court during two centuries. Among the stories more or less probable about Charles and his court, there is one which we are amused to see Dr. Vehse telling without a smile of scepticism. It reads like </p><p>an Eastern apologue. Charles, says the story, ordered for the punishment of slanderers at his court, that they should creep on all fours and bark like a dog for a couple of hours every morning. This, however, lasted but a short time; for the ministers complained that for half the morning they could not have one rational idea, so loud and many-throated was the barking! Among the embassies sent by Charles to foreign countries, was one to Russia, with the purpose of mediating between that empire and Poland. Herberstein, one of the chief functionaries engaged in this embassy, has left a minute account of all that took place--of the gracious demeanour of the Czar, who asked him if he had ever had his beard shaved off; and on hearing “yes," condescendingly observed that he too had undergone that operation on his second marriage. In the entertainment given to the embassy by the Russian nobles, the drinking seems to have been fast and furious, and the drinking of healths must have been especially formidable. “This drinking of healths,“ says Herberstein, “is performed with peculiar ceremony: he who proposes the health stands in the middle of the room, and says what he wishes for the prince or seigneur, whose name he mentions--happiness, victory, and health, and that there may remain just so much blood in his enemies as he (the drinker) will leave in his goblet. This he says with his head uncovered, and as soon as he has drunk the wine to the bottom he throws the drinkingvessel</p><p>on his head” (sets it on, we suppose, after the manner of a hat). The coarseness of this Russian hospitality is curiously in contrast with the sobriety and simplicity of the entertainment which Herberstein and his colleagues met with on their embassy to the Turks, when the whole party ate out of one dish at a time, and moistened their lips with water. </p><p>In 1556, when Charles's brother Ferdinand I. became emperor, nine-tenths of the people even in Austria were, according to the testimony of the Venetian ambassador, Protestant. The new doctrine had indeed a special attraction for the aristocracy in the spoils of church property which it threw in their way. At Wittenberg, the place of education for all the sons of the nobility, three young men of the Austrian aristocracy were successively rectors of the Lutheran university; the authority of the Pope was generally despised, and the two parties lived peacefully side by side until the foundation of the Society of Jesuits. Under these circumstances Ferdinand was by compulsion tolerant, though he was a bigoted Catholic, and had a Jesuit for his confessor. Under him the Jesuits quietly gained a footing in Vienna, at first residing humbly with the Dominicans, and making themselves known chiefly as physicians while the plague was raging. His son and successor, Maximilian II., was tolerant by choice. He was a liberal-minded, strong-hearted man, who had little of the Hapsburg in him besides the gout, which seems to have been so inevitable an attribute of Imperial majesty in those days, that courtiers could hardly have hit on a more delicate mode of flattery than swathing their limbs in flannel and hobbling.* During Maximilian’s short reign, Austria enjoyed the last good government it ever saw under the house of Hapsburg. His successors down to Maria Theresa were a compound in different proportions of the virtuoso and the bigot. In Rudolf II., the next emperor, the virtuoso predominated; and throughout his reign of thirty-six years he neglected all the business of government to shut himself up in his palace, the Hradschin at Prague, in company with his coins and pictures, his pet lions, leopards and eagles, his mechanics, alchemists, and magicians. His letters, published in 1771, give evidence that he was acquainted with six languages, was versed in mathematical, mechanical, and physical science, and yet more in astrology, magic, and alchemy. The first important picture-gallery in Germany was collected by Rudolf; he spent immense sums on antiquities Of all kinds, especially gems, coins, cameos, and medallions; and the unique cabinet of coins and polished stones, at Vienna, is formed chiefly from his collections. Amongst the treasures Which he purchased at an immense price, were the splendid Greek sarcophagus sculptured with the battle of the Amazons, and the great onyx cup with the apotheosis of Augustus. This </p><p>*A certain Eberhard von Raubc, who married Max’s natural daughter, may perhaps excite the envy of this beard-cultivating generation, when they </p><p>are informed that his beard descended from his chin to the earth, and from thence m turned up to his girdle. </p><p>cup had been brought from the East by the Knights of St. John, during the crusades, and owed its preservation in the convent of Poissy, near Paris, to the belief that it bore a representation of the crucifixion! Rudolf"s “Treasure-chamber" at Prague was celebrated far and wide; but, sad to say, its contents were scattered in the enlightened eighteenth century, under Joseph II. The statues were sold; a torso found no purchaser, and was thrown into the garden, where an oculist of Vienna picked it up, and bought it for a trifle, and at the Congress of Vienna, Louis, the Crown Prince of Bavaria, obtained it for a thousand ducats--it is the Ilioneus in the Glyptothek, at Munich. The old coins were sold by weight; and in an inventory made before the sale, a Leda of Titian figured as “A naked Woman bitten by a mad Goose." Rudolf's court was a resort for all the thaumaturgi and necromancers of Europe; and among the rest we find two Englishmen, John Dee and Edward Kelley. John Dee drove the black art with such success, that he could boast of always seeing his genius, when he left his desk, obligingly sit down in his place and carry on his studies; when he returned, he had only to tap his genius on the shoulder, and it stood up. Edward Kelley paid dearly for the honour which Rudolf bestowed on him in making him a Freiherr (Baron) of Bohemia; for, finding that he could not or would not make gold, Rudolf imprisoned him in a Bohemian castle, where he lay for six years. Queen Elizabeth applied for his release in vain; and at last, in an attempt to escape by a rope, the unfortunate alchemist broke his leg, and died in consequence of the fall. To Prague came also the “Illustrissimus" Marco Bragadino, with his two bull-dogs, supposed to be familiar spirits. He was honoured as a second Paracelsus, especially as he seemed to esteem gold no more than brass or quicksilver, made great presents, and kept open table. The “ Illustrissimus," however, died on the gallows. While Rudolf was throwing away money on these charlatans, he was paying, and sometimes omitting to pay, the meagre salary of 1500 guilders (about 150l.), to Kepler, who was installed at Prague as “Imperial Mathematician." Shutting himself up from any personal participation in affairs, the emperor necessarily wanted informers and news-carriers, who were most conveniently to be found among his personal attendants; and he thus began the practice which has characterized the Austrian monarchs, of being distrustful and monosyllabic to their ministers and aristocracy, and confidential to scribes and lackeys. Rudolf remained unmarried, deterred by the horoscope drawn for him by Tycho Brahe, which declared that “danger threatened him from his nearest relative--his own son." He does not seem to have apprehended that any one of his numerous illegitimate children could be implied under this prediction. The terror of assassination naturally grew with advancing years and feebleness, and was exaggerated by the appearance of Halley's comet in 1607, which</p><p>seemed palpably to portend his fall. At length his dread reached such a pitch, that his walks were taken only in long passages, into which the air was admitted by oblique apertures. These passages led to his stables, a favourite resort of his; and those who had to ask a favour of him, frequently disguised themselves as grooms in order to obtain an interview. Such was the emperor whom his servants called the second Solomon! </p><p>Matthias, in whose favour Rudolf was deposed, was a lover of pleasures, and his court was gay with festivals and spectacles .The taste which presided over them may be inferred from the description of a procession in honour of his wedding, in which Greek gods and symbols are oddly mingled with such mediaeval apparitions as a crocodile made of linen and paint, moved by a man placed inside, and surmounted by a “vomehme Person.” Weddings and christenings, among the aristocracy of those days, seem to have been on a colossal scale. It is characteristic that in a contemporary description of a wedding, where 294 guests were invited and 141 aesembled, it is mentioned as a remarkable fact, that “neither curses nor unseemly speech was heard from any one, nor was there any excessive drinking.” This high degree of moderation, however, was not rewarded by a happy termination of the festivity, for the floor fell in, and the gay ladies and gallant gentlemen had to be extricated from dust, beams, and mortar. As they were Protestants, the Catholics regarded this catastrophe as a manifestation of divine wrath--a theory of Providence which the Protestants were equally ready to apply upon occasion. Before the reign of Matthias closed, the first scene in the terrible tragedy of the Thirty Years' War was acted. Two Catholic noblemen, the representatives of the emperor at Prague, were hurled out at window by the deputies of the exasperated Protestants, who had been forbidden to continue the building of their churches. This was the famous Defenestratio Pragensis of 1618. On the 20th of March in the next year, the insignificant Matthias died; an event which was regarded as a marvellous fulfilment of Kepler's prophecy, with the seven M’s for the year 1618:--Magnus Monarcha Mundi Medio Mensa Martii Morietur. Such is the tribute which great men must pay to the spirit of their age!</p><p>“Better a wilderness than a land full of heretics," was the favourite saying of Ferdinand II., who had early made a vow to our Lady of Loretto and the Pope, that he would restore the Catholic religion. The aspect of the court must have been any thing but lively in his day, with an emperor at the head of it whose most important occupation was hearing masses, and assisting, with bare head and taper in hand, at religious pilgrimages. He introduced the procession to Herrnals, which took place in the middle of Lent, and was intended to obliterate the memory of the time when Herrnals was a nest of Protestantism; and the people streamed thither from Vienna to hear the evangelical pastor preach from the castle window. The procession was a sort of sacred masquerade, in which Herod, Pilate, Joseph, and Mary, and the whole personnel of the New Testament history, were represented as riding on asses. The road was lined with people also in masquerade, who scourged themselves, wore black tables of sins on their breasts, or dragged heavy chains and crosses. This is the comic side of Ferdinand’s achievements in majorem gloriam Dei; the tragic side is the devastation of his dominions by the longest of religious wars. His son, Ferdinand III., inherited his spirit, and further distinguished himself by his zeal for the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, though he had not, like us, had the edification of seeing it established on papal authority. </p><p>The Peace of Westphalia, which terminated the Thirty Years' War, left the emperor in an entirely new relation to his aristocracy. Great numbers of the old hereditary nobles in Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary, had been proscribed on account of their Protestantism; and their places had been, to a great extent, taken by military adventurers and parrenus—Scotsmen, Spaniards, Walloons, and Italians—who had risen to prominence in the war. Many of the old nobility, indeed, did not hesitate to de clare themselves converts to Catholicism for the sake of retaining their fortunes or winning advancement; but their position was thenceforth necessarily one of obligation to the court. Thus the chain of aristocratic families, which had once been able to defy the emperor, was broken. From this time, the list of Austrian nobility is variegated with Scotch, Spanish, Flemish, and Italian names—a means of amalgamation which is, probably, less objectionable in its result than in its origin. It is a striking fact in the history of Austria, that the German race has never furnished her most distinguished statesmen and generals. As diplomatists and statesmen, Sclavonians predominate; and among them are, perhaps, the two greatest—Lobkowitz and Kaunitz. Of her generals, Tilly was a Walloon, Wallenstein a Bohemian, Eugene and Montecuculi Italians, and London of Scotch extraction. </p><p>Leopold 1., who succeeded Ferdinand III. in 1657, and reigned nearly half a century, had bigotry enough to merit the epithet “Great” from the Jesuits; but this dark background was relieved by a gay embroidery of virtuosism, love of sports, and splendour. The Maréchal de Grammont has left an amusing description of Leopold when he was eighteen, and as yet only king of Hungary. One of the attributes of his youthful majesty was a large month, which he kept constantly open. Playing one day at nine-pins with his favourite, Prince Portia, he complained that the rain fell into his mouth. The Prince, after due reflection on the difficulty, suggested that his majesty should shut his royal mouth. “Which the king of Hungary did, and found himself much benefited thereby." Besides nine-pins his amusements were a sad and silent game with four cards, played after dinner with the Archduke his uncle, and music, in which he was already so great a proficient that he could compose very wretched melodies with the utmost correctness. Twenty years later, this engaging youth had matured into a little man, still lax as to his mouth, of mumbling speech and weak legs, crushed beneath a huge perruque, and dressed, after the Spanish fashion, with red shoes and stockings. In devotion he was not behind even Ferdinand II.; he heard three masses a day, and was persuaded that he was under a special supernatural guidance. This guidance the priests called his “miracle;" so did his enemies, but they meant by it the miraculous luck of the house of Austria. “Poor Leopold, I am not afraid of," said Louis XIV., “but I am afraid of his miracle." When the Turks, after the capture of Belgrade, in 1688, wished for peace, Leopold would not accept the proposal, although a new war with France was impending. “One must know the Emperor as well as I do," said Max Emanuel of Bavaria to Villars, “to believe what are the reasons which deter him. Monks have prophesied to him that the Empress will have twins, and that contemporaneously with this the Turkish empire will fall, and one of the twins will sit on the throne of Constantinople. When Belgrade was taken, the Empress actually became pregnant; and now Leopold firmly believes that the rest of the prophecy will be fulfilled; and at no price will he hear of peace." This “Leopoldus Magnus" limited his activity in state affairs to signing the papers presented to him by his ministers, writing confidential letters to his brothers and cousins on the thrones of Europe, and giving audiences. These avocations were carefully recorded by Leopold himself in his calendar, together with his losses at cards; and posterity has thus the advantage of knowing that, in the year when the Turks besieged Vienna, and drove Leopold out of his capital, he signed 8256 documents, and lost 965 ducats at cards. Leopold’s apathy was never interrupted except when, as in the Hungarian insurrections, self-preservation and bigotry impelled him to the violent suppression of heresy and rebellion. Then, as he said, “be tapped his fingers and heads flew off." With these exceptions, he left the management of affairs to his ministers, and to the intrigues of the Jesuits and the Camarilla. Leopold's great passion was music. He played on several instruments, and often conducted the orchestra from his box at the opera. “Pity your Majesty was not a professor of music!" said his kapellmeister one day, in a naive burst of admiration. The Pasquin of Vienna, in grimmer mood, posted up on the palace gates—“Leopoldo sis Caesar, et non musicus, sis Caesar et non Jesuita!" The world, however, is really indebted to the musical taste hereditary in the House of Hapsburg; the Imperial Kapelle at Vienna, always kept up on a high scale of magnificence, has been a nursery for the highest music, and has furnished a point d'appui for the genius of such men as Caldara, Gluck, Mozart, and Beethoven. The Ferdinands had only patronized church music, but Leopold was an enthusiastic admirer of the opera; and under him representations were got up in a lavish style. His third wife (the Austrian Emperors were eminently anti-Whiolonian), more unmitigatedly devout than himself, accompanied him in his constant visits to the opera with sighs, and read psalms and prayers instead of the opera text. Another passion of Leopold's was hunting—memorable as having given rise to the tobacco monopoly which has played a great part in Austrian affairs. Leopold, who was always in embarrassment for money, had not enough to carry on his hunting in the country above the Erms, and Count Khevenhuller offered to supply what was necessary, if a monopoly of the importation of tobacco were granted him for twelve years. He received it!</p><p>The dreary stiffness and tedious minuteness of Austrian etiquette seem to have been constantly on the increase. De Grammont gives a curious sample vof punctiliousness which occurred when Leopold, as king of Hungary, was holding his court at Frankfort. All the Electors came to visit the king, and this was his manner of receiving them: he waited for them at the head of the stairs, and when he saw them below, he descended three steps. When the Elector Moritz paid his visit, he observed that the king had only descended two steps, and remained standing at the bottom of the stairs until Leopold had been told that he had yet another step to descend. The Emperor’s toilet—the inducing of the small head and thin legs in the large perruque and red stockings—was performed in the presence of two chamberlains “of the gold key," and two “of the black key." The chamberlains of the black key were the real attendants; they of the golden key assisted with their presence only; and of such officials there were no less than 600 in Leopold's time, the office of course being, in the majority of cases, purely honorary, as that of Hofrath is now. The Emperor dined at eleven, generally alone, for none but princes of the empire were eligible to sit down with him. The papal nuncio and ambassadors attended to see him take his first draught, and then withdrew. When he drove out, he was attended by 300 guards, horse and foot, and more than twenty carriages. The noblemen and gentlemen of his court accompanied him on foot through the town, unless it rained, when they were allowed to go on horse back. Once out of the town, they got into the empty carriages, one half preceding and the other half following the Emperor. All this, says the Abbe Pauchelli, a traveller of that day, diffuses about the person of the Emperor “veramente una venerabile maesta." That all this stiffness of etiquette was after Leopold's own heart, and that there was very little genial human blood in his veins, is proved by his conduct on a memorable occasion. There are few more thrilling moments in history than the early morning of the 12th of September, 1683, when Vienna lay half in ruins under the bombardment of the Turks. The only hope of its deliverance rested on John Sobiesky, king of Poland, who had joined his forces to the Austrians under the Duke of Lorraine, and had posted himself on the neighbouring heights. The evening before, a note from Starhemberg, who commanded in Vienna, and a shower of rockets from the tower of St. Stephen's, had given the signal that “no time was to be lost;" and the answering rockets and cannon from John Sobiesky had thrown the Viennese into an ecstasy of joy. With the first rays of the sun the troops poured down from the heights, and the city which had so long been theoutwork of Christendom was saved. The Turks fled in such haste and dismay, that their tents with all their immense stores were taken into quiet possession by the Poles and Austrians. It is said that the immense provision of coffee found in these tents created the prevalent taste for coffee in Vienna; and the first licence to keep a coffee-house was given in this very year to a Pole named Koffschutzky, who, as messenger to the Duke of Lorraine, had rendered important services to the city. No sooner had it been known that the Turks were approaching Vienna, than Leopold had fled in terror with his family. That he returned in peace and safety he owed to John Sobiesky; yet when he was about to meet the deliverer of his capitol, his grand preoccupation was, how he should compliment the King of Poland without compromising his Imperial dignity. “How shall I receive him?" he said to the Duke of Lorraine. “How else, your Majesty, than with open arms? for he has saved the empire." At last it was decided that they were to meet on horseback: and Leopold behaved with the most repulsive coldness. Sobiesky, indignant, wrote to his wife: “Any one would think now that we had the plague, and people were afraid to come near us; while before the battle my tents which, thank God, are tolerany roomy, could scarcely hold the multitude of comers. . . . . Every one is disheartened, and wishes we had never helped the Emperor; so that this proud race might have been overthrown, never to rise again."</p><p>Leopold's belief in divine protection and guidance did not prevent him from dabbling in alchemy. He more than once threw away his gold on adventurers who held out to him the hope that they could make ducats indefinitely. A certain Conte Ruggiero, whose full title was a mosaic of three languages—Don Dominica Manuel Caiétano, Comte de Ruggiero, Neapolitano, Kurbairischer Feldmarschall und Statsrath—had a salary of 15,000 gulden en attendant the preparation of a certain tincture which was to do the work of Midas's fingers. But before the tincture was prepared, Leopold died. Nor did his devoutness exclude the love of pomp and gaiety; the earlier years of his reign, at least, were crowded with festivities and amusements.</p><p>The year in which Leopold married his first wife, the Spanish Princess, was distinguished by an oddly variegated series of entertainments. One day arrive from Augsburg the wonderful presents in silver—mirrors, candlesticks, caskets, vases, &amp;c., which Grafseslie (one of the murderers of Wallenstein) is to carry to the Sultan. Another day, a Jew is baptized, and the Emperor stands as godfather. Sledging was a favourite recreation, the gentlemen and ladies wearing fancy dresses. But the crowning exhibition in honour of the marriage was a Roos-habet, or spectacle of horsemen. A gigantic wooden building was erected before the palace for the performance, in which the Emperor took part. It was preceded by a prologue representing a contest between the elements, as to which of them had the greater claim to the production of the pearl (Margarita, the name of the Empress). </p><p>The elements were represented by four companies of riders, amounting to 1000 men. The knights of Water were dressed in blue and silver, decked with fish-scales and mussel-shells. Behind them came, on a huge carriage, a whale carrying Neptune on his back, surrounded with sea-monsters and Tritons carrying fire works, and with a chorus of thirty representing the Winds. The knights of Earth were clad in green and silver; behind them came, on a huge carriage, two great elephants bearing a tower on their backs, on which the earth rested. The carriage represented a garden, and in it sat the god Pan, with his shepherds bearing burning clubs, and with a chorus representing the wonders of the earth. The knights of Air were attired in pink </p><p>and gold, adorned with rainbows. On the carriage behind them came the Air sitting on a terrible dragon, accompanied by harpies in gold, who carried a fire before them, and by a chorus of all sorts of birds. Above the carriage was a rainbow, and on it sat a singer who celebrated the praises of the Empress. Last came the knights of Fire, in red and silver, armed with silver hammers, and leading a machine on which there was a monstrous bonfire, containing an unconsumed salamander, with elaborate fire works playing from its jaws. Behind, followed the carriage of Etna, vomiting flame, and on it sat Vulcan attired in flesh-colour and black, and carrying a silver hammer. He was attended by thirty one-eyed giants with silver hammers, and a chorus of Cupids. After a little preliminary interchange of abuse between the squadrons, the combat was announced by the sound of drums and trumpets; the wooden theatre, which had previously represented the Ehrenberg, assumed the form of a ship, and the Argonauts were seen sitting as judges, with a golden fleece and an Imperial crown. When the squadrons had fallen on each other with a terrific clang, a cloud began to spread itself over the heavens; and while they were gazing upwards in amazement, the cloud parted, and disclosed a starry globe with Eternity seated on a rainbow. Eternity forbids the cavaliers to fight for the golden fleece and the Imperial crown, since they have been destined from the beginning for the House of Austria. The globe opens, and shows the Temple of the Elements, with the fifteen genii of the deceased emperors on horseback. The genii approach the temple, followed by the chariot of Glory in the form a silver mussel-shell. The chariot contains a great pearl, with the likeness of the Empress in </p><p>it, and the genius of the Emperor Leopold as the sixteenth of the House of Austria. Three other chariots follow, with Indians, Moors, and Tartars, as prisoners (no Turks). The globe at length disappears, and the Roos-habet begins. </p><p>The inventor of this prologue was rewarded with present of 20,000 gulden (2000l.) and a pension of 1000 gulden; The Roos-habet itself, in which the Emperor appeared, consisted of a procession of cavaliers glittering in gold and jewels, with triumphal chariot drawn by eight white horses, and carrying a company of singers; the chariot paused on arriving beneath the window where the Empress was watching the spectacle; and the singers gave forth their music. After this, the journal which gives the description intimates that the exhibition came to an abrupt ending, by the prudently vague statement that “the parties of cavaliers rode amongst each other." Apparently, Imperial Majesty had not been able to keep its seat on horse</p><p>more excited by the music than subdued to the consciousness of its Imperial burthen. On future occasions, when the Roos-habet was repeated, the Emperor contented himself with being a spectator. </p><p>The most remarkable man among Leopold's ministers was Lobkowitz, who held high posts for more than thirty years, and for a long time had almost unbounded influence over the Emperor. In many points Lobkowitz resembled his great successor, Kaunitz: he loved luxury and splendour, was full of caustic repartee, and had a strong liking for France and French fashions. He was inwardly opposed to the league with the maritime powers against France, which formed the policy of Leopold's reign; and this probably was the real cause of his fall. To the Jesuits, in spite of their formidable power, he was an open foe, and directed the arrows of his wit against them without fear or scruple. Leopold was completely in the grasp of the Jesuits, and could deny nothing. Lobkowitz, however, obviated several of his foolish gifts; for example, on one occasion, when the Emperor had made the Society a grant of the important Grafschaft of Glatz, the determined minister tore up the document, and when the Jesuits came to him to receive the parchment, he showed them a crucifix, and pointing to the letters I. N. R. I., he interpreted them to mean, Jam nihil reportabunt Jesuitae. 'This time the Jesuits will carry away nothing.’ Even in his will he prepared a final sting for them. After an apparently decent preamble, at the bottom of a page he bequeathed to the Fathers of the Society of Jesus 82,000—here the leaf had to be turned over, and on the other side followed—“nails towards a new building." To the bitter enemies whom Lobkowitz thus made for himself he had imprudently added a woman and an empress—Claudia of Tyrol, Leopold's second wife. Their united intrigues, together with his opposition to the French war, at length brought about his disgrace: he was suddenly deprived of all his employments, forbidden to ask the reason, and banished to his country house, where he gratified his sarcastic humour by having a room furnished half with princely splendour, and half as a miserable hut; in the one half he commemorated his former elevation, in the other, on the walls of which he wrote satires and epigrams on his enemies, he indicated his utter fall. </p><p>The ablest military commander in the earlier part of Leopold's reign was Montecuculi, celebrated for his victories over the Turks and his “Memoirs della Guerra." Like Eugene, who near the close of the same reign commenced a similar and yet more brilliant career as generalissimo of the Imperial army against the French and the Turks, Montecuculi was a statesman, a philosopher, and a man of letters, as well as a great general. One of the next to him in command was Count Sporck, who was a type of the tribe of military adventurers and parvenus fostered by the Thirty Years' War—a mixture of the rudeness and ignorance of the common soldier, the instincts of an able commander, and the astuteness of a man of the world who can push his way to fortune, make money, and keep it. In the battle of St. Gothard, when Montecuouli commanded the last attack on the Turks, Sporck knelt down and prayed thus: “Almighty Generalissimo above, if thou will not to-day help us, thy believing children, at least do not help the Turkish dogs, and it shall be the better for thee!" In his last campaign against Turenne, this once hardy soldier had become so enfeebled that he wept when he gave the order to his cavalry to advance—not a very inspiriting sight to subordinates! But then as now, old men lay like the chills of a lingering winter on the youthful vigour of armies. When Sporck was on his death-bed, he ordered his chaplain to read to him some fine story of a hero. The chaplain chose the history of Samson. But when he came to the slaying of a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, the old soldier called out from his pillow, “Hold thy tongue, there, I know well enough what an honest man can do!" </p><p>Characteristic of the time in another way is the story of the Prince de Ligne, who in the last decade of Leopold's reign came as ambassador to Vienna. Of a highly distinguished Flemish family, and possessed of immense wealth by marriage, the Prince created a great sensation in Vienna by the splendour of his establishment and the lavishness of his presents and entertainments. Among the Viennese gentlemen with whom he was most intimate Was a Count Hallweil: both were fond of high play, and were collectors of coins and medals. One day the Prince invited Hallweil to hunt with him, and they drove out into the forest together, accompanied by a single servant, a Frenchman, the</p><p>Prince having excused himself from taking the Count's servant also, on the ground that the carriage would not hold four. In the evening the Prince returned without the Count, and at a soirée, in answer to the inquiries of the latter's sister, said carelessly, that on their way they had met with a servant in yellow livery with a carriage, and Hallweil had joined him, intending to go to Baden. Two days passed, and the Count did not appear; articles forwarded for him to Baden did not reach him, and he was nowhere to be heard of. His relatives began “to have suspicions. They knew that a short time before, the Prince had lost 50,000 gulden to Hallweil, and that, not being able to pay immediately, he had given a bill for the amount, at the same time begging the Count not to mention the debt, lest it should be sup posed that he (the Prince) was in want of money. Notwithstanding his promise of silence, Hallweil had publicly spoken of the debt, and the Prince was aware of it. One evening soon </p><p>[Vol.LXIII. No.CXXIV.]—NEW SERIES, Vol.VII. No.II.	Y</p><p>after, on his sitting down to cards with a lady, she said to him, “But if your Excellency loses, will you pay me?" “Madam," he replied, “it is true I am in debt to Hallweil, but he shall certainly be paid." In answer to the pressing demands of the Count’s relatives, the Prince continued to reply that he was not bound to say what had become of him after they had separated. At length they applied to the Emperor, the forest was searched with dogs, and the Count's body, with four wounds in it, two from a pistol and two from under a heap of stones to in a marshy place. It was brought to Vienna and publicly exhibited in the Count's hotel, in the hope of raising popular tumult against the ambassador, whom the law of nations protected from Austrian justice. After demanding in vain an audience of the Emperor and the ministers, the Prince presented himself unannounced to Count Kinsky, and begged to lay down his function, that he might fight his slanderers. “In that case," said Kinsky, "you must fight every old woman, for the talk of the whole country." The people had laid wait to attack him as he returned to his palace, but he eluded them, and managed to escape from Vienna in the dress of monk. In Portugal he had to undergo a trial for the murder, but was acquitted. He urged in his defence that the Count had played falsely, and therefore he was no longer bound to treat him as a gentleman—even if he had been guilty of the deed. On his acquittal he appeared again at court, and subsequently pursued his study of coins and medals at Venice, where he died in 1710. At Vienna there remained a tradition that jealousy had been the motive of the murder. </p><p>The iniquitous war of the Spanish succession, inaugurated on the side of France by the lowest treachery and tampering with wills, and on the side of Austria by the poisoning of a queen and boy-prince, occupied the last years of Leopold‘s reign, and was carried on with vigour under his successor, Joseph I. It opened a field for the genius of Marlborough and Eugene, and enabled them to present the unfrequent spectacle of two men great enough to be friends in circumstances which would have made meaner natures rivals. In its general bearing the war was momentous to Europe, but its immediate object is best characterized by the words of the adventurous Peterborough, who had a brilliant share it it, to his opponent, Vendome. Vendome wore the likeness of Philip V., the French claimant of the Spanish throne, set in diamonds, on his breast, and Peterborough that of Charles VI, the Austrian claimant, in “Are we not a couple of good-natured old donkeys," said Peterborough, “to knock ourselves about for these two simpletons? In either case, Spain gets a sorry king!" Joseph I., who lived only six years after his accession, was not without sense and spirit. He had been brought up by men who were no friends to the Jesuits, and he was the first emperor, since the institution of the Order, who had not a Jesuit for his confessor. This was by no means satisfactory to the fathers of the Society; they accused the confessor to the Pope of being more devoted to the Emperor than to the Vatican, and he was cited to appear at Rome. Hereupon Joseph declared, that “ If his confessor must go to Rome, he should not go without plentiful companionship, for all the Jesuits in the Austrian dominions should go with him!" The Pope gave way to this energetic threat.</p><p>Charles VI. had spent eight years of his youth in Spain, and had come back with a double incrustation of Spanish hauteur overlaying his Austrian phlegm. When he visited England on his way to Spain, he was shocked and annoyed at the unceremonious manners of the English, who, not at all awed by this avatar of Imperial majesty, came close to his carriage to offer their greetings and shout their cheers. It seems indeed that he had the smallest possible liking for our country and ways, for notwithstanding the cordial reception given him by Queen Anne, and the rows of young ladies who stood like a grove of dahlias and hollyhocks lining the way to his apartment, he hurried away from Windsor the next day, and though a storm drove his shipback into Torbay, the pressing invitations of the Queen and nobility could not induce him to set his foot on English ground again. In person and in taste Charles was very nearly a reproduction of his father, Leopold I.; he inherited the thin legs, the hanging lip, the confused utterance, and the love for hunting and music. The bigotry in him was of rather a milder cast, owing perhaps to his travels and his intercourse with Englishmen and Hollanders; but all the hatred he economised on heretics he gave to the French. The Spanish dress, with the red stockings and shoes obligato, was still the mode at court, and if any one appeared there in white silk stockings, Charles pointed him out to the general disgust as a "cursed Frenchman." One French fashion, however, the perruque, was oddly blended with the severity of the garments which we admire in the portraits of Velasquez, but the privilege of appearing in this incongruous adjunct was confined to the Emperor when the court was at Vienna, and was only allowed to the nobility at the country palaces. The Prater, which had hitherto been a hunting forest, was altered after the pattern of the Prado at Madrid, and was reserved for the slow and solemn promenades of the Emperor and his court. The members of the Imperial family were saluted with three reverences in the Spanish fashion, which included the bending of the knee, and the Emperor and Empress dined alone under a canopy on a dais, like the ideal kings and queens of a child's fairy tale. Some relaxation of etiquette was allowed at supper in the apartments of the Empress, but even then, no minister could sit at table with her unless he were a cardinal. All the movements of the court were ordered according to an inexorable rule. Each month had its regular gala-days, in which courtiers were admitted to the honour of kissing hands and seeing their majesties dine; its Golden Fleece days, when all the knights of the Order appeared in their robes at mass and vespers; and last, not least, its Devotion-days, which were a terrible corvée to the foreign ambassadors who happened to be of a mercurial temperament. The gay Duc de Richelieu relieved himself, after the endurances of a Lent at the Viennese court, by a piteous complaint to Cardinal Polignac. “Il n'y a qu’un Capucin avec la santé la plus robuste qui puisse résister a cette vie pendant le caréme. Pour en donner une idée a Votre Eminence j'ai été de compte fait depuis le dimanche des rameaux jusqu'au mercredi d'apres Paques, cent heures a l'église avec l'Empereur." His Eminence replied, “Imaginez-vous précisément la meme chose d'un cardinal a Rome. Il est vrai que nous sommes payés pour cela." </p><p>The number of persons attached to the court by some titular dignity or pension under Charles VI., is said to have been not less than forty thousand; and of these, two thousand were salaried and active officials. How, it is natural to ask, was this host of attendants lodged? They were quartered on the householders of Vienna, who were expected, for a slight compensation, to reserve the second story of their dwellings for the reception of persons attached to the court. At first it seems astounding that this burthen could be quietly submitted to, but the patience of the Viennese under it is partly explained by the fact that it opened an avenue to a little interest at court. It was abolished by Joseph II., who commuted the furnishing of houseroom into a small yearly payment. The traditional idea that it was beneath the imperial dignity to have any care for the finances, gave the utmost licence to shameless prodigality and peculation in subordinates. The expenses of the court as well as the wars of the empire were carried on only by means of advances on the revenue, and loans for which the Emperor was glad to pay eight per cent. Greedy nobles, officials, and Jews became rich at the expense of the Imperial exchequer, and while the magnificence of the Austrian aristocracy was the amazement of travellers, the service on the Emperor’s table was old and shabby. Half Vienna lived and avowedly lived out of the Imperial cellar and kitchen. Of course the accounts were of the usual imaginative kind:—the Empress required twelve cans of Hungarian wine for her sleeping draught, and each of her ladies could not be supplied with less than six; two casks of Tokay were yearly required to soak the bread for the Empress’s parrots, and the parsley for the court kitchen cost about 4001. a year. The system of boundless almsgiving contributed not a little towards the financial confusion. Leopold had introduced the practice of giving regular audiences to beggars, in which he sometimes distributed packets containing 50, 100, or 200 ducats; and this mode of seeking the salvation of the Imperial soul at the expense of the commonwealth was continued to the end of Maria Theresa's reign. The court also bore the entire cost of the Opera, which was conducted on a very lavish scale; a first representation rarely costing less than £6000. A new era was then beginning for the Italian opera, into which Metastasio was breathing the tender, amorous spirit of his honeyed verse. The little Abbé, of rococo appearance, came to Vienna as court poet in 1729, invited by the Emperor's accomplished mistress, the “Spanish Althann," whom Metastasio at first worshipped as a “bright particular star," but was afterwards supposed to have privately married. Charles’s passion for this mistress—who more than divided his time and attentions with his lovely wife, Elizabeth of Brunswick—so far from scandalizing the Jesuits, was encouraged by them, for reasons of their own; indeed, they found in it an edifying resemblance to the love of Jesus and the wounds of the Lamb.</p><p>The luxury of the aristocracy at this period—the taste and splendour of their furniture, and the profusion of their tables— astonished Lady Mary Wortley Montague. It was especially the fashion to have a multiplicity of wines, and at dinner-parties, a list of wines was placed under the cover of each guest. The witty Bussy, who had been sent on a temporary mission to Vienna, allowed himself the pleasure of a joke at the expense of this Viennese ostentation. He had an unusually long list of wines placed under the plates, and when one of the guests expressed his surprise that the ambassador could have laid in so various a stock of wines, Bussy requested him to read the superscription to the list. It was this: “Inventory of the wines which I have not." On the opposite side of the carts was a list of the few kinds which he could really offer his guests. Alchemy still continued to be a drain on the fortunes of the great. Vienna swarmed with alchemists, and those who could afford kept an </p><p>alchemist in their establishment. How strong was the epidemic belief in occult powers, may be judged from the fact that the Due de Richelieu, fort esprit as he was, could be induced, with two of his Austrian companions, to appoint a midnight rendezvous with a charlatan who promised to give them what they most desired. That the expectation which led them out was a serious one, seemed to have a terrible proof in the discovery, made the next morning, of the unfortunate charlatan weltering in his blood—a victim, as was supposed, of the young noblemen's vengeance on him for his imposture. The Sybaritism of the higher ranks was mingled with no little ferocity, heightened probably by the abundant sprinkling amongst them of Spanish and Italian blood, and by the perpetual wars in which the empire had been engaged. Duels, in spite of the severest edicts in which both principals and seconds were threatened with death and confiscation of property, were very rife in Vienna, where a spot called the “ Ochsengriessen” was the Austrian “Chalk Farm." Duels were then often fought on horseback, a custom of which we see a memorial in Wouveremann's pictures; and not unfrequently the seconds, nay, the passers-by, mixed themselves in the combat, so that it became</p><p>a kind of skirmish. Domestic morals, as might be expected, were not of a higher order than social morals: the rule for the higher classes was a mariage de convenance, tempered by cicisbeism. The first care of a woman after her marriage was to provide herself with a cavalier, as a necessary part of her establishment; and so completely was this kind of double marriage recognised in Vienna, that it was thought a mortal offence to a lady to invite her to dinner without inviting her lover as well as her husband. This second relation, however, like the first, seldom had love for its basis; it was entered into with the utmost deliberation, and among the articles of the contract was a pension to be paid to the to the lady if her lover should prove inconstant, as event which the said article might have some potency in preventing; at any rate it was of rare occurrence, and some of these liaisons lasted twenty years. We might wonder that many men were found willing to incur such an alternative, but it seems that relation of this kind was one of the things “expected of them" by society, and without it a man was held to cut a poor figure. Lady Mary Wortley Montague tells us that she knew several ladies in the highest society, whose hypothetic pensions were talked of as confidently as their actual incomes. It may be imagined that with these calculating ladies, who moreover had daily to construct and support a headdress about as large and heavy as a milk-pail, the coquetry and intrigue of French society were unknown: they sinned with solemnity. </p><p>Far above all other men at Charles's court, like an oak among brambles, was Prince Eugene, one of the seven generals whose genius Napoleon declared to be worth studying, a far-sighted and liberal-minded statesman, a student as well as a patron of art and science, and an ingenuous, unaffected, and warm-hearted man. The youngest of the five sons of Olympia Mancini, one of Mazarin's celebrated nieces, he was brought up at the French court, but was looked on with little favour by Louis Quatorze, who made the great mistake of refusing him a military commission, which he had asked for as a substitute for ecclesiastical dignities. On his refusal, Eugene left France, declaring that he would not set foot there again but with sword in hand as an enemy, a threat which nine years later he fulfilled. Louis thus made the fatal blunder of unconsciously presenting his enemy Austria with the greatest general she ever possessed. Eugene was beloved by his soldiers, for whom he often provided out of his own purse, when, as it frequently happened, the administration at home had no money for them. In spite of Austrian obstructiveness, he abolished in his army advancement by seniority. “Messieurs the civilians," he said, “may be as strict as they like in their regard to seniority in their council chambers; but in the end it will be seen, even there, that it leads to nothing but an increase of confusion. Seniority in service is the mother of jealousy, self-interest and cabals. As subtle and slow poison gradually destroys the body, so seniority undermines states and armies. Nothing must be left untried to rid us of this incumbrance." When Eugene laid down the sword, he devoted himself with all the energy of his intense nature to the labours of states manship: he attempted to introduce reforms in administration and finance, to stimulate commerce, and to rouse the Emperor to a real interest in the condition of the people. Charles, however, never heartily liked his great general, and only endured the predominance which his achievements and character made inevitable. But unmindful of coldness and jealousies, happy in his own activity, in his correspondence with men of science, his collections, and his buildings, as well as his political projects, he remained, to the good old age of seventy-three, according to Lady Mary Wortley Montague’s comparison, “like Hercules at the court of Omphale." For a quarter of a century he had scarcely ever failed, when in Vienna, to spend his evening at the Duchess of Holstein's, where he met his beloved friend the Countess Batthiany, or at the Countess's own house. His well-known horses, with their rose-coloured harness, might be seen in the last years of his life, finding their way from his palace to the hetel of the beautiful Countess, and standing still at the door, though for some time no one got down; for the aged servants were asleep outside the carriage, and their aged master asleep within.</p><p>With Charles VI. the male line of the House of Hapsburg terminated, and his daughter Maria Theresa, by her marriage, introduced what is called the House of Lorraine. Under Maria Theresa the thick ice of Austrian etiquette began to thaw. Her proud and high spirit was tempered with a certain bourgeoise good nature; the troubles which surrounded her on her accession compelled her to court popularity, and the predilections of her husband, added to the alliance with France which was ultimately brought about by Kaunitz, helped to introduce French fashions and the French language. Maria Theresa had been educated by her father with Spartan severity; coffee, that sweet unmurderous poison, was rigorously withheld; and, like the disciples of Pythagoras, she was commanded to abstain from beans, for which, however, she had an unconquerable weakness. Even after she was married, her waiting-woman could only smuggle the too tempting vegetable in a cap-box, in a prayer-book case, or in the riding equipage of her husband. The rules for her intellectual education seem to have been chiefly of the negative kind, defining what she was not to know: her historical and geographical knowledge was such as could be gathered from a miserable Jesuitic compendium; and even in languages, a part of culture which is not dangerous to piety, she was so poorly taught that she spoke them all with the most comic Germanisms. But her mother-wit and strength of character secured for her a personal influence which no mere acquirements can obtain; perhaps, also, she owed some of her ascendency to her beauty, which, as pictures and the less questionable testimony of eye-witnesses assure us, was imperial. It was a tall, luxuriant, Gothic beauty, with blue eyes, magnificent blond hair, and admirable hands and arms. Yet Podewils, in one of his despatches, says of her that she took no care of her beauty, and exposed herself fearlessly in all weathers, walking many hours together in the heat of the sun or in the most biting cold. She was the most intrepid of horse women, and won the enthusiastic affection of her troops by show ing herself among them continually, bestowing marked distinction on military merit, and giving liberal largesses. “Elle cherche généralement," says the ambassador, "a s'eloigner de son sexe et ambitionne des vertus qui lui sont moins propres et qui en font rarement l'appanage. Il semble qu'elle soit fachée d'etre née femme." In one of her weaknesses she was at once masculine and feminine—she had a man's jealousy of her power and a woman's jealousy of her husband; and by the one passion she created the evil which the other passion made her dread. She would allow her husband no share in the direction of affairs, she even checked him in the presence of her council, for giving his opinion on business of which he knew nothing. He was thus reduced to be, as his son Joseph said, "an idle man surrounded by idlers," and his natural inclination to gallantry led him into flirtations with the fair ladies of the court. Francis was a handsome, fascinating, easy-tempered man, affectionate, temperate, free from bigotry, and a hater of constraint and etiquette. His education had been so neglected that he could barely read and write, but he had abundant sense, had travelled much in Germany, France, Italy, and England, and had a taste for art. His talent at calculation he turned to practical account, not only by conducting profitable speculations for himself, but by exposing many financial abuses in the state. Maria Theresa at once domineered over him and doated on him. Any of her ladies to whom he was observed to pay more than usual attention was removed; and she used all the devices of a woman and an empress to prevent him from having male associates who had a reputation for gallantry. The consequence was that petits soupers and excursions were arranged with the most cautious secrecy. After years of unavailing marital police, Maria Theresa resigned herself to her husband's habits, and on one occasion showed a complete triumph over her personal feeling. When, after the death of this beloved husband, the Empress presented herself for the first time in the midst of her court, she found the crowd of ladies and gentlemen gathered on one side, while on the other, in deep mourning, bathed in tears and deserted by all, stood the Princess Auersperg, Francis's mistress. The Empress, not without a smile of contempt at the mean crowd who, but a few days before, had courted the woman they now shunned, went up to the Princess, took her hand, and said aloud, “We have indeed had a great loss, dear friend!" For fifteen years after her husband's death the Empress remained in the deepest mourning. She never again occupied the apartments where she had lived with Francis, but removed to the next story, where all the rooms were hung with black. On the 18th of every month, and through the whole month of Augustin every year, she shut herself up from the World to mourn for her loss. She was equally affectionate as a mother, and many letters of hers remain to attest the anxiety she felt about the education of her sixteen children. It is a curious instance of the perverting tendency of state policy, that this tender mother used the utmost exertions to effect a marriage between one of her daughters and the coarse, brutal Ferdinand of Naples, of whose character she had the greatest horror. In a letter giving minute directions as to the discipline which she thinks will best prepare her daughter for this destiny, she says, “I regard the poor Josepha as a sacrifice to policy; provided that she does her duty towards God and her husband, and secures her salvation, even if she must be unhappy, I shall be contented." Josepha was rescued from marriage by death, and her place was taken by Caroline—the Caroline who is associated with the darkest page in Nelson's history. Of her still more unhappily celebrated daughter Marie Antoinette, there is a story which, if not true, is not ill-invented. When her marriage with the Dauphin was in contemplation, Maria Theresa went to visit a nun in a neighbouring convent, who had the reputation of being able to look into the future. She expressed her anxiety for the good, pious child, who for the rest of her life was to be separated from her and live at a court so corrupt as that of Louis XV. The answer she received was: “She will have great reverses, and afterwards she will become pious again.” It pierced the heart of the Empress to think that her daughter would cease to be pious, but the negotiations for the marriage were not broken off. Of another daughter, the Archduchess Elizabeth, who was never married, a charming mot is recorded. She had an abscess in her cheek, and when Sir Robert Keith, the English ambassador, paid her a visit of condo lence, she laughed and said: “Croyez-moi, pour une archiduchesse de quarante ans, qui n'est pas mariée, on trou a la joue est an amusement." The good-natured ease, liveliness, and beauty of Maria Theresa had a magical effect on her subjects at the commencement of her reign; and even later, when discontent at unfulfilled promises and unpopular measures created murmurs against her, her radiant presence was like a sudden sunbeam to them. For some time after her husband‘s death she had never appeared in the theatre. One evening, as she was working in her cabinet, the news came that her first grandson was born; she rushed in her dishabille into the Palace theatre, and leaning over the front of her box, exclaimed, “Poldel (Leopold) has a boy, and it is just come as a present on my wedding-day—that is gallant !" Pit and boxes were electri.ed. Her most fetal weakness was bigotry. It led her into the wretched mistakes of pensioning converts to Catholicism, and forcing the children of Protestant parents into conventual education and Catholic marriages. It instigated the oppressive “transplantation" of Lutherans into Saxony, and the petty persecution of those who were still suffered to remain in her dominions. She was equally tyrannical in morals, and visited aberrations with a severity almost as inquisitorial as that of the English Puritans. Thinking it possible to “put down vice by external measures, she instituted a Commission of Chastity—a kind of extra police, to watch over one</p><p>department of morals.—In spite of her active and temperate habits, she became so corpulent as she, advanced in life, that all movement was difficult to her, and she was conveyed up and down stairs in a machine. When she heard mass, the floor of her bedroom was opened, and the service was performed in a chapel arranged in the room below. She repeatedly insisted on being let down by a chair and rope into her husband's grave. When, the last time, the rope broke, she said, “ He wants to keepme: I shall soon come." A few days after she was taken ill. She had agreed with her physician that when her last moment was come, he should intimate it to her by asking if she wished for lemonade. When the words were uttered, she struggled to rise, and said, “ Open the window." “ Whither does your Majesty wish to go?" said her son Joseph, gently holding her arm to support her. “To thee! I come!" were her last words. </p><p>Kaunitz, the soul and right hand of Maria Theresa's policy, was so highly valued by her that she tolerated the licence of his life, which he took no pains to conceal from her. He one day put a stop to an incipient lecture on this subject, by saying, “Madam, I came here to speak on your affairs, not mine." In his efforts towards an alliance with France he won her hearty co-operation: and this head of the Commission of Chastity, who never spoke of the Empress Catherine but as “cette femme," was induced by Kaunitz to write a letter to Madame de Pompadour, in which she addressed the all-powerful mistress of Louis XV. as "Madame, ma chere soerr et cousine,"—a “sacrifice to policy" which threw her husband Francis into convulsions of laughter. Kaunitz had more difficulty in winning over the Empress to his second great scheme, the expulsion of the Jesuits. To his arguments she had two replies: “The Jesuits are the bulwark of all authority," and—tears. At length the discovery that her confessions had been revealed by her Jesuit confessor, and other secrets of the Order which Kaunitz had become possessed of through an apostate, prevailed, and the edict for their expulsion was signed in 1772. These two wise measures of Kaunitz were more than counterbalanced by his co-operation in the partition of Poland, into which he was cajoled by the flattery of Frederick the Great. It is honourable to the judgment of Maria Theresa that she saw at once the impolicy and the moral turpitude of this measure. On signing the deed for the partition, she recorded her disapprobation in these words: “Placet, because so many great and learned men desired it; but when I have been long dead, it will be seen what are the consequences of this injury to all that has hitherto been held sacred and just." On a separate paper She wrote a further protest, in which she says, “In this matter, wherein not only public right is notoriously against us, but all justice and sound reason, I must confess that never in my life have I been so grieved or so ashamed to let myself be seen." Maria Theresa felt the value of Poland as a screen between her dominions and Russia, which she always dreaded as a neighbour; but Kaunitz, if he had ever shared her opinions, had had his perceptions deadened by the grateful incense of Frederick's flattery. Indeed, this acute diplomatist, who was all his life occupied in piercing the minds of other men, had a colossal vanity and self-valuation that made him appear quite naive. “Heaven," he used to say, “requires a hundred years in order to produce a mind great enough to restore a monarchy. Then it rests a hundred years; this makes me fear for the Austrian monarchy after my death." The Prince de Ligne heard him say to a Russian who was presented to him: “I advise you, Sir, to buy my portrait, for your countrymen will be glad to become acquainted with the person of a man who for fifteen years governed this monarchy as its greatest minister; who knows everything, understands every thing, and sits better on horseback than any man of his time." His tastes and habits were all formed on the French model, much to the advantage of Austrian manners, for in spite of envious blame, his influence inevitably determined the reigningfashion. In one point he set an excellent example: like Eugene, he treated men of letters and artists with distinction, and placed them at his table among counts and princes. Gluck was an especial favourite with him; and the great composer often showed his broad, scarred, manly face in the minister's circle, where he must have looked very much like a rough shepherd's dog among the sleek pets of the drawing-room. It is true Kaunitz thought himself entitled to exact no slight deference from artists, as well as from the rest of the world. When the Archduke Leopold was about to be married at Innspruck, Kaunitz went there beforehand to see that all was in order for the festivities. The opera, above all things, was the object of his attention; and when Gluck assured him that everything was in perfect preparation, “Good," said Kaunitz, “let the opera be at once performed." “How!" exclaimed Gluck, “without an audience?" “Monsieur Gluck," answered the minister, “sachez que la qualité vaut bien la quantité; je suis moi seul une audience." Kaunitz had three horrors—scents, fresh air, and death. Ladies piquing themselves peihaps on their récherchi perfumes, were chased from him with the terrible words, “Allez-vous en, Madame, vous puez!" His coach was hermetically closed, and his favourite exercise of horsemanship was taken under cover, except in the heat of summer. “The Prince is coming!" was the signal for closingthe ever-open windows of Maria Theresa's apartments, and Caroline Pichler says that he wore nine black silk mantles, in order to accommodate the layers of drapery to the temperature of the room. Yet, in defiance of hygiene, he lived to be eighty-four. The mention of “death” and “small-pox" was strictly forbidden in his presence, and his readers and friends had to tax their talent for periphrasis in order to avoid the offensive words. The death of his old friend Baron Binder was thus announced to him: “Baron Binder is no longer to be met with." Like Lobkowitz and Metternich, Kaunitz had always the mot saillant at command, and from the shelter of his position he darted his sarcasms with little consideration for others. Now and then, as will happen, he got a Roland for his Oliver. “ So," he once said to Casanova, “ Rubens was a diplomatist who amused him self with painting?" “No, your highness," said the caustic Italian, “ he was a painter who amused himself with diplomacy."</p><p>One of the most graphic accounts of Maria Theresa's court is that of our countryman, Wraxall. When the education of the Empress was so deficient, it is not surprising to learn from him that the culture of women generally in Vienna was extremely narrow. They received their education in convents, and their literature consisted chiefly of such sacred legends as those of St. Theresa and St. Catherine; a woman who had read Cervantes, Crebillon, and Le Sage was a prodigy. The morning was spent either in dishabille and idleness or in the labours of the toilette. To be sure, the morning was a short one, dinner being then, as now, the only thing towards which Germans seem to hurry. Half-past one was the dinner hour, and it was bon ton to make calls about half-past two, when people were supposed to be rising from dinner. In a few of the principal houses, such as those of Kaunitz and Colloredo, the evening receptions were perfectly unconstrained; the guests amused themselves with play or conversation, at their pleasure. Cards were universal. Wraxall, less critical than Lady Mary Wortlsy Montague, who in the preceding reign thought the Austrian women endowed by Heaven with an exceptional share of ugliness, praises the persons of the Viennese ladies and the taste with which they were their jewels. It is true, he says, that the most beautiful women in Vienna are not at all Austrian, but Italians, Bohemians, Hungarians, and Poles. Rouge was adopted by young and old, notwithstanding the better example of the archduchesses, to whom the Empress strictly forbade it. After the death of Francis, rouge was prohibited, on pain of the Empress’s displeasure, and it is a proof of the unlimited authority which Maria Theresa exercised, that this prohibition was effectual. Gradually, however, when the deepest mourning was over, rouge was again adopted. On the other sex, Wraxall passes a severe judgment. According to him, the Austrian exquisite was an insufferable mixture of awkwardness, ignorance, and pride, with an elephantine imitation of French manners. The standard of education at the universities and seminaries was very low; and in fact the sweeping character of the censorship, due mainly to Maria Theresa’s bigotry, is sufficiently significant of the prevalent intellectual condition. The greater part of the books which formed the library of cultivated peoplein England and France, nay, even in Florence and Rome, were forbidden, and their introduction was attended with difficulty and danger.</p><p>In the early part of Maria Theresa’s reign, the court balls and other festivities were conducted with oriental magnificence, and gave rise to some grumbling on the part of her English allies, who had not furnished substdics for such a purpose. Dutens tells of a masked ball at which there were 6000 persons, and supper prepared for 10,000. The rooms were illuminated with 18,000 wax lights, and everything had been so thoroughly provided for, that physicians, surgeons, and even midwives, were in attendence in case of accident. The appointments of the palace—furniture, plate, and stables, were on a scale of reckless luxury, and, strange to say, all this was in the most terrible period of the Seven Years' War. Alms and pensions were </p><p>another tremendous item in state expenditure, and every change in the ministry cost the exchequer the price of splendid estates and palaces to the in-comers, and consolamry presents to the out-goers. The change in the ministry by which Kaunitz cum to the head of a.hirs, cost the state a million gulders (£100,000). </p><p>When Joseph II. was eight-and-twenty, Frederick the Great passed this significant judgment on him: “He has grown up at a bigoted court, and has rejected superstition; he has been brought up in splendour, and has adopted simple habits; he has been nourished on incense, and is nevertheless modest." An emperor filled with enthusiasm for the general well-being, a venerator of Rousseau, an asserter of right in opposition to privilege, was indeed a new apparition on the throne of the Hapsburgs. “Since I have ascended the throne," wrote Joseph, “and have borne the first diadem in the world, I have made philosophy the lawgiver of my kingdom." Unhappily, Joseph and his lawgiver wrought in too crude a material for their creations to be lasting, and his nine years’ efforts shared the fate of all sweeping reforms which emanate from a single mind, and are not the outgrowth of national development. An edict of tolerance was followed by the boldest measures tending to the emancipation of the Church from Home, and the abolition of superstitions practices. In the suppression of monasteries and shrines, many precious manuscripts and works of art were lost, but in this matter Joseph was relentless; he was an adorer of the useful, and had little sensibility to art. The administration of justice, bureaucracy, taxation—every department was included in his schemes of purification and reform. His grand mistake was the attempt to force his wide and heterogeneous dominions into a system of centralization, a mistake which was soon revealed to him by the revolt of the Netherlands and of Hungary. In the curtailment of aristocratic privileges, and the cheapening of rank, his influence was more permanent. He not only ennobled mercantile men to an unprecedented extent, and created, to the amazement of Vienna, the first Jewish baron, but also enriched his exchequer by an indiscriminate sale of titles. The once imposing “von," became as common as the English “esquire." Joseph sternly refused to recognise rank as a claim to preferment. To the widow of a general of high birth, who had asked him to give a company of infantry to her son, he wrote: “I by no means see the obligation a monarch is under to confer a place on a subject because he is an aristocrat by birth. . . . I know your son, and I know what belongs to a soldier. . . . Hence, I pity you, madam, that, your son is fit neither for an officer, nor for a statesman, nor for a priest,——in a word, that he is nothing but an aristocrat, and is that to the backbone." The Prater, which had before been reserved for the nobility, was opened to the people, and nine years later, the Augarten also, with this inscription over its gate: “A place of recreation, dedicated to all men by one who esteems them." To the lavishness of Maria Theresa's reign was substituted the utmost economy in every department. Joseph's personal habits were simple and laborious: he rose at five, and devoted his whole morning to work the length of the morning varying according to the amount of business, so that his dinner, prepared for two o'clock, was often, to the anguish of cooks, kept waiting till four. His chief amusements were music,—for which he had considerable talent, writing a sonata, which Mozart told him, was “good, though he who composed it was better"—the theatre, travelling incognito, and conversation. He patronized the German, and not the French theatre; for he was bent on giving the predominance to the German language, which had been so long thrust out of the court, first by Italian, and recently by French. During the later years of his life, he spent five evenings of every week in a select circle of the most intelligent women in Vienna, and on his death-bed, he wrote a charming note of thanks to this little society, addressed, “Aux cinq dames réunies de la société, qui m'y toleraient." Joseph had a feverish impetuosity, a haste to set everything right, which was often</p><p>self-defeating, and made Frederick the Great say of him, that “he always took the second step before the first." But, as if to justify this haste, death soon came to put an end to his noble efforts. In the beautiful words of the Prince de Ligne— </p><p>	“Il entreprit beaucoup et commencant toujours,</p><p>	Ne put rien achever éxcepté sea beaux jours.”</p><p>Joseph was deeply attached to his first wife, Isabella of Parma, in whose history there is a melancholy interest. Accomplished and agreeable, she had yet a deep stamp of sadness, which was either constitutional or, as some believed, the result of a hopeless attachment formed before marriage. She made Joseph happy by responding outwardly to his affection; but even after the birth of a child, she remained, when in private, unvaryingly sad, and frequently expressed to her female friends the belief that her death was near. This presentiment was fulfilled only two years after her marriage, and Joseph remained inconsolable for her loss. At length his sister Christina, with the idea of alleviating his sorrow, told him that Isabella had only apparently and not really returned his affection. This lightning-stroke at once scorched and seared Joseph's heart. For a long time he was embittered against women generally, and was with difficulty persuaded to a second marriage. The choice at length made was an unfortunate one; Joseph had no more domestic happiness,and died without children. </p><p>The two years of his feeble and dissolute brother Leopold's reign, from 1790 to 1792, were made memorable by the declaration of war against France, and were followed by the long reign of Francis II., who, in that notable shuffling of the cards known as the Congress of Vienna, dropped the venerable but long unmeaning title, “Emperor of Germany," and became “Emperor of Austria." Francis's affectation of the Viennese dialect, his professed interest in the private affairs of his citizens, his ostentatious observance of trivial laws, and his will, in which he bequeathed his love to his people, and promised to "pray for them at the throne of God," prevailed on some of his credulous subjects to believe that the virtual gaoler of Spielberg, the man who imprisoned Pellico and Gonfalonieri, and who betrayed Hofer, was a kind soul—a people's emperor. Civil crimes, such as murder, theft, and swindling, he often pardoned, but towards political crimes he was implacable; and he said of himself, “I am a bad Christian at pardoning—that is hard work for me; Metternich is much milder." Fonder of making sealing-wax and carving miniature boxes than of attending to affairs, he was yet too cold, suspicious, and obstinate to rely on others; and even Metternich was obliged sometimes to bend to his blind will, for “over stupidity the gods themselves are powerless." The good nature which he only affected, his son, Ferdinand I., really possessed; but he had also more than the paternal inheritance of genuine intellectual nullity. This harmless “King Log," whom the storm of 1848 swept into a safe nook out of the current of affairs, had a naive conviction of his own efficiency in the state. “I should like," he said, “for once to go to a suburban theatre, but it is impossible—I may be wanted:" and on hearing, in his retirement at Prague, that the good old status quo was fast returning, he exclaimed, “Ah, we made our people happy; but it was a dog's life we led!" On the high priest of these wooden Dagons, Metternich, we have not space to dwell. Those who watched the earlier part of his career, saw no prognostics that he was to become, like Kaunitz, “the coachman of Europe," and keep the reins for nearly forty years. Stein pronounced him “vain, cunning, shallow, and frivolous," and despised the assiduity with which Metternich arranged tableaux vivans, and ranged the ladies who were to take part in them, at the very moment when momentous conferences were going forward. But while Metternich was playing the lady’s man, he was acquiring his diplomatic accomplishments, in which he was avowedly both a pupil and a utilizer of women. When ambassador at Paris, in 1808, his first achievement was to win the favour of Caroline Murat, Napoleon's favourite sister. The Emperor at first said scornfully to her, “Amusez ce niais la; nous en avons besoin a present." But it was soon found that Metternich made important political use of the lady's smiles. Every one knows how the great coachman had to lay down the reins, leave the box, and escape for his life; but as every one may not know a few particulars of this fight, which Count Mailath tells us, we will close with them our fragmentary sketches of Austrian rulers and Austrian manners. After escaping from Vienna in a fiacre, and remaining in concealment at a friend's house for three days, Metternich and his wife were at length safely deposited in a private carriage, supposed to be empty, on the railway at Olmutz. After remaining for seventeen hours shut up in this carriage, the Prince exclaimed, “Whether I die of thirst, or any other way, is all one; I must have something to drink." At a station he called for a glass of water, and thus the rest of the passengers became aware that the carriage was not empty. Immediately it was whispered about, “They are suspicious persons." At this critical moment, the friend who had charge of Metternich's car riage, let the conductor into the secret, and the signal for starting was given; several passengers who had got down were left behind, but the Prince was saved. Once more he was in danger. At an inn it was noticed that the pretended English always spoke French, and the fineness of their linen was remarked. The suggestion, “It may be Prince Metternich," was met with the energetic answer, “If I knew that, I would kill him with my own hand." This admonition that it would be well to push on was not neglected, and thenceforward their journey was pursued without any further threatening adventures to Holland, and finally to England.</p><p>[VoL LXIII. No. CXXIV.]—NEW SERIES, Vol. VII. No. II. 	Z</p><p>THREE MONTHS IN WEIMAR. </p><p>IT was between three and four o'clock, on a fine morning in August, that, after a ten hours' journey from Frankfort, I awoke at the Weimar station. No tipsiness can be more dead to all appeals than that which comes from fitful draughts of sleep on a railway journey by night. To the disgust of your wakeful companions, you are totally insensible to the existence of your umbrella, and to the fact that your carpet-bag is stowed under your seat, or that you have borrowed books and tucked them behind the cushion. 'What's the odds, so long as one can sleep?' is your formule de la vie, and it is not until you have begun to shiver on the platform in the early morning air that you become alive to property and its duties, i.e., to the necessity of keeping a fast grip upon it. Such was my condition when I reached the station at Weimar. The ride to the town thoroughly roused me, all the more because the glimpses I caught from the carriage window were in startling contrast with my preconceptions. The lines of houses looked rough and straggling, and were often interrupted by trees peeping out from the gardens behind. At last we stopped before the Erbprinz, an inn of long standing in the heart of the town, and were ushered along heavy-looking in-and-out corridors, such as are found only in German inns, into rooms which overlooked a garden just like one you may see at the back of a farmhouse in many an English village. </p><p>A walk in the morning in search of lodgings confirmed the impression that Weimar was more like a market town than the precinct of a Court. 'And this is the Athens of the North!' we said. Materially speaking, it is more like Sparta. The blending of rustic and civic life, the indications of a central government in the midst of very primitive-looking objects, has some distant analogy with the condition of old Laced mon. The shops are most of them such as you would see in the back streets of an English provincial town, and the commodities on sale are often chalked on the doorposts. A loud rumbling of vehicles may indeed be heard now and then; but the rumbling is loud, not because the vehicles are many, but because the springs are few. The inhabitants seemed to us to have more than the usual heaviness of Germanity; even their stare was slow, like that of herbivorous quadrupeds. We set out with the intention of exploring the town, and at every other turn we came into a street which took us out of the town, or else into one that led us back to the market from which we set out. One's first feeling was how could Goethe live here in this dull, lifeless village? The reproaches cast on him for his worldliness and attachment to court splendor seemed ludicrous enough, and it was inconceivable that the stately Jupiter en redingote, so familiar to us all through Rauch's statuette, could have habitually walked along these rude streets and among these slouching mortals. Not a picturesque bit of building was to be seen; there was no quaintness, nothing to remind one of historical associations, nothing but the most arid prosaism.</p><p>This was the impression produced by a first morning's walk in Weimar, an impression which very imperfectly represents what Weimar is, but which is worth recording, because it is true as a sort of back view. Our ideas were considerably modified when, in the evening, we found our way to the Belvedere chauss e, a splendid avenue of chestnut trees, two miles in length, reaching from the town to the summer residence of Belvedere; when we saw the Schloss, and discovered the labyrinthine beauties of the park; indeed, every day opened to us fresh charms in this quiet little valley and its environs. To any one who loves Nature in her gentle aspects, who delights in the checkered shade on a summer morning, and in a walk on the corn-clad upland at sunset, within sight of a little town nestled among the trees below, I say come to Weimar. And if you are weary of English unrest, of that society of 'eels in a jar,' where each is trying to get his head above the other, the somewhat stupid bien- tre of the Weimarians will not be an unwelcome contrast, for a short time at least. If you care nothing about Goethe and Schiller and Herder and Wieland, why, so much the worse for you you will miss many interesting thoughts and associations; still, Weimar has a charm independent of these great names. </p><p>First among all its attractions is the Park, which would be remarkably beautiful even among English parks, and it has one advantage over all these, namely, that it is without a fence. It runs up to the houses, and far out into the corn fields and meadows, as if it had a 'sweet will' of its own, like a river or a lake, and had not been planned and planted by human will. Through it flows the Ilm not a clear stream, it must be confessed, but, like all water, as Novalis says, 'an eye to the landscape.' Before we came to Weimar we had had dreams of boating on the Ilm, and we were not a little amused at the difference between this vision of our own and the reality. A few water-fowl are the only navigators of the river, and even they seem to confine themselves to one spot, as if they were there purely in the interest of the picturesque. The real extent of the park is small, but the walks are so ingeniously arranged, and the trees are so luxuriant and various, that it takes weeks to learn the turnings and windings by heart, so as no longer to have the sense of novelty. In the warm weather our great delight was the walk which follows the course of the Ilm, and is overarched by tall trees with patches of dark moss on their trunks, in rich contrast with the transparent green of the delicate leaves, through which the golden sunlight played, and chequered the walk before us. On one side of this walk the rocky ground rises to the height of twenty feet or more, and is clothed with mosses and rock plants; on the other side there are, every now and then, openings breaks in the continuity of shade, which show you a piece of meadow land, with fine groups of trees; and at every such opening a seat is placed under the rock, where you may sit and chat away the sunny hours, or listen to those delicate sounds which one might fancy came from tiny bells worn on the garment of Silence to make us aware of her invisible presence. It is along this walk that you come upon a truncated column with a serpent twined round it, devouring cakes, placed on the column as offerings a bit of rude sculpture in stone. The inscription Genio loci enlightens the learned as to the significance of this symbol, but the people of Weimar, unedified by classical allusions, have explained the sculpture by a story which is an excellent example of a modern myth. Once on a time, say they, a huge serpent infested the park, and evaded all attempts to exterminate him, until at last a cunning baker made some appetizing cakes which contained an effectual poison, and placed them in the serpent's reach, thus meriting a place with Hercules, Theseus, and other monster-slayers. Weimar, in gratitude, erected this column as a memorial of the baker's feat, and its own deliverance. A little farther on is the Borkenhaus, where Carl August used to play the hermit for days together, and from which he used to telegraph to Goethe in his Gartenhaus. Sometimes we took our shady walk in the Stern, the oldest part of the park plantations, on the opposite side of the river, lingering on our way to watch the crystal brook which hurries on, like a foolish young maiden, to wed itself with the muddy Ilm. The Stern (Star), a large circular opening amongst the trees, with walks radiating from it, has been thought of as the place for the projected statues of Goethe and Schiller. In Ranch's model for these statues the poets are draped in togas, Goethe, who was considerably the shorter of the two, resting his hand on Schiller's shoulder; but it has been wisely determined to represent them in their 'habit as they lived,' so Rauch's design is rejected. Of classical idealising in portrait sculpture, Weimar has already a sufficient exemplar ad evitandum in the colossal statue of Goethe, executed after Bettina's design, which the readers of the 'Correspondence with a Child' may see engraved as a frontispiece to the second volume. This statue is locked up in an odd structure, standing in the park, and looking like a compromise between a church and a summer-house (Weimar does not shine in its buildings!) How little real knowledge of Goethe must the mind have that could wish to see him represented as a naked Apollo, with a Psyche at his knee! The execution is as feeble as the sentiment is false; the Apollo-Goethe is a caricature, and the Psyche is simply vulgar. The statue was executed under Bettina's encouragement, in the hope that it would be bought by the King of Prussia; but a breach having taken place between her and her royal friend, a purchaser was sought in the Grand Duke of Weimar, who, after transporting it at enormous expense from Italy, wisely shut it up where it is seen only by the curious.</p><p>As autumn advanced and the sunshine became precious, we preferred the broad walk on the higher grounds of the park, where the masses of trees are finely disposed, leaving wide spaces of meadow which extend on one side to the Belvedere all e with its avenue of chestnut trees, and on the other to the little cliffs which I have already described as forming a wall by the walk along the Ilm. Exquisitely beautiful were the graceful forms of the plane trees, thrown in golden relief on a back-ground of dark pines. Here we used to turn and turn again in the autumn afternoons, at first bright and warm, then sombre with low-lying, purple clouds, and chill with winds that sent the leaves raining from the branches. The eye here welcomes, as a contrast, the white facade of a building looking like a small Greek temple, placed on the edge of the cliff, and you at once conclude it to be a bit of pure ornament a device to set off the landscape; but you presently see a porter seated near the door of the basement story, beguiling the ennui of his sinecure by a book and a pipe, and you learn with surprise that this is another retreat for ducal dignity to unbend and philosophize in. Singularly ill-adapted to such a purpose it seems to beings not ducal. On the other side of the Ilm the park is bordered by the road leading to the little village of Ober Weimar, another sunny walk which has the special attraction of taking one by Goethe's Gartenhaus, his first residence at Weimar. Inside, this Gartenhaus is a homely sort of cottage, such as many an English nobleman's gardener lives in; no furniture is left in it, and the family wish to sell it. Outside, its aspect became to us like that of a dear friend, whose irregular features and rusty clothes have a peculiar charm. It stands, with its bit of garden and orchard, on a pleasant slope, fronting the west; before it the park stretches one of its meadowy openings to the trees which fringe the Ilm, and between this meadow and the garden hedge lies the said road to Ober Weimar. A grove of weeping birches sometimes tempted us to turn out of this road up to the fields at the top of the slope, on which not only the Gartenhaus but several other modest villas are placed. From this little height one sees to advantage the plantations of the park in their autumnal coloring; the town with its steep-roofed church, and castle clock-tower, painted a gay green; the bushy line of the Belvedere chauss e, and Belvedere itself peeping on an eminence from its nest of trees. Here, too, was the place for seeing a lovely sunset such a sunset as September sometimes gives us, when the western horizon is like a rippled sea of gold, sending over the whole hemisphere golden vapors, which, as they near the east, are subdued to a deep rose-color.</p><p>The Schloss is rather a stately, ducal-looking building, forming three sides of a quadrangle. Strangers are admitted to see a suit of rooms called the Dichter-Zimmer (Poets' Rooms), dedicated to Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland. The idea of these rooms is really a pretty one: in each of them there is a bust of the poet who is its presiding genius, and the walls of the Schiller and Goethe rooms are covered with frescos representing scenes from their works. The Wieland room is much smaller than the other two, and serves as an antechamber to them; it is also decorated more sparingly, but the arabesques on the walls are very tastefully designed, and satisfy one better than the ambitious compositions from Goethe and Schiller. A more interesting place to visitors is the library, which occupies a large building not far from the Schloss. The principal Saal, surrounded by a broad gallery, is ornamented with some very excellent busts and some very bad portraits. Of the busts, the most remarkable is that of Gluck, by Houdon a striking specimen of the real in art. The sculptor has given every scar made by the small-pox; he has left the nose as pug and insignificant, and the mouth as common, as Nature made them; but then he has done what, doubtless, Nature also did he has made one feel in those coarsely-cut features the presence of the genius qui divinise la laideur. A specimen of the opposite style in art is Trippel's bust of Goethe as the young Apollo, also fine in its way. It was taken when Goethe was in Italy; and in the Itali nische Reise, mentioning the progress of the bust, he says that he sees little likeness to himself, but is not discontented that he should go forth to the world as such a h bscher Bursch a good-looking fellow. This bust, however, is a frank idealization; when an artist tells us that the ideal of a Greek god divides his attention with his immediate subject, we are warned to take his representation cum grano. But one gets rather irritated with idealization in portrait when, as in Dannecker's bust of Schiller, one has been misled into supposing that Schiller's brow was square and massive, while, in fact, it was receding. We say this partly on the evidence of his skull, a cast of which is kept in the library, so that we could place it in juxtaposition with the bust. The story of this skull is curious. When it was determined to disinter Schiller's remains, that they might repose in company with those of Carl August and Goethe, the question of identification was found to be a difficult one, for his bones were mingled with those of ten insignificant fellow mortals. When, however, the eleven skulls were placed in juxtaposition, a large number of persons who had known Schiller, separately and successively fixed upon the same skull as his, and their evidence was clinched by the discovery that the teeth of this skull corresponded to the statement of Schiller's servant, that his master had lost no teeth, except one, which he specified. Accordingly it was decided that this was Schiller's skull, and the comparative anatomist, Loder, was sent for from Jena, to select the bones which completed the skeleton.* The evidence certainly leaves room for a doubt; but the front fuyant of the skull agrees with the testimony of persons who knew Schiller, that he had, as Ranch said to us, a 'miserable forehead;' it agrees, also, with a beautiful miniature of Schiller, taken when he was about twenty. This miniature is deeply interesting; it shows us a youth whose clearly cut features, with the mingled fire and melancholy of their expression, could hardly have been passed with indifference; it has the langer g nsehals (long goose-neck), which he gives to his Karl Moor; but instead of the black, sparkling eyes, and the gloomy, overhanging, bushy eyebrows he chose for his robber hero, it has the fine wavy, auburn locks, and the light-blue eyes, which belong to our idea of pure German race. We may be satisfied that we know at least the form of Schiller's features, for in this particular his busts and portraits are in striking accordance; unlike the busts and portraits of Goethe, which are a proof, if any were wanted, how inevitably subjective art is, even when it professes to be purely imitative how the most active perception gives us rather a reflex of what we think and feel, than the real sum of objects before us. The Goethe of Ranch or of Schwanthaler is widely different in form, as well as expression, from the Goethe of Stieler; and Winterberger, the actor, who knew Goethe intimately, told us that to him not one of all the likenesses, sculptured or painted, seemed to have more than a faint resemblance to their original. There is, indeed, one likeness, taken in his old age, and preserved in the library, which is startling from the conviction it produces of close resemblance, and Winterberger admitted it to be the best he had seen. It is a tiny miniature painted on a small cup, of Dresden china, and is so wonderfully executed, that a magnifying-glass exhibits the perfection of its texture as if it were a flower or a butterfly's wing. It is more like Stieler's portrait than any other; the massive neck, unbent though withered, rises out of his dressing-gown, and supports majestically a head, from which one might imagine (though, alas! it never is so in reality) that the discipline of seventy years had purged away all meaner elements than those of the sage and the poet a head which might serve as a type of sublime old age. Amongst the collection of toys and trash, melancholy records of the late Grand Duke's eccentricity, which occupy the upper rooms of the library, there are some precious relics hanging together in a glass case, which almost betray one into sympathy with 'holy coat' worship. They are Luther's gown, the coat in which Gustavus Adolphus was shot, and Goethe's Court coat and schlafrock. What a rush of thoughts from the mingled memories of the passionate reformer, the heroic warrior, and the wise singer!</p><p>* I tell this story from my recollection of Stahr's account in his Weimar und Jena, an account which was confirmed to me by residents in Weimar; but as I have not the book by me, I cannot test the accuracy of my memory. </p><p>The only one of its great men to whom Weimar has at present erected a statue in the open air is Herder. His statue, inaugurated in 1850, stands in what is called the Herder Platz, with its back to the church in which he preached; in the right hand is a roll bearing his favorite motto Licht, Liebe, Leben (Light, Love, Life), and on the pedestal is the inscription von Deutscher aller lande (from Germans of all lands). This statue, which is by Schaller of Munich, is very much admired; but, remembering the immortal description in the Dichtung und Wahrheit, of Herder's appearance when Goethe saw him for the first time at Strasburg, I was disappointed with the parsonic appearance of the statue, as well as of the bust in the library. The part of the town which imprints itself on the memory, next to the Herder Platz, is the Markt, a cheerful square, made smart by a new Rath-haus. Twice a week it is crowded with stalls and country people; and it is the very pretty custom for the band to play in the balcony of the Rath-haus about twenty minutes every market-day to delight the ears of the peasantry. A head-dress worn by many of the old women, and here and there by a young one, is, I think, peculiar to Thuringia. Let the fair reader imagine half a dozen of her broadest French sashes dyed black, and attached as streamers to the back of a stiff black skullcap, ornamented in front with a large bow, which stands out like a pair of donkey's ears; let her further imagine, mingled with the streamers of ribbon, equally broad pendants of a thick woollen texture, something like the fringe of an urn-rug, and she will have an idea of the head-dress in which I have seen a Thuringian damsel figure on a hot summer's day. Two houses in the Markt are pointed out as those from which Tetzel published his indulgences and Luther thundered against them; but it is difficult to one's imagination to conjure up scenes of theological controversy in Weimar, where, from princes down to pastry-cooks, rationalism is taken as a matter of course.</p><p>Passing along the Schiller-strasse, a broad pleasant street, one is thrilled by the inscription, Hier wohnte Schiller, over the door of a small house with casts in its bow window. Mount up to the second story and you will see Schiller's study very nearly as it was when he worked in it. It is a cheerful room with three windows, two toward the street and one looking on a little garden which divides his house from the neighboring one. The writing-table, which he notes as an important purchase in one of his letters to K rner, and in one of the drawers of which he used to keep rotten apples for the sake of their scent, stands near the last-named window, so that its light would fall on his left hand. On another side of the room is his piano, with his guitar lying upon it, and above these hangs an ugly print of an Italian scene, which has a pendant equally ugly on another wall. Strange feelings it awakened in me to run my fingers over the keys of the little piano and call forth its tones, now so queer and feeble, like those of an invalided old woman whose voice could once make a heart beat with fond passion or soothe its angry pulses into calm. The bedstead on which Schiller died has been removed into the study, from the small bedroom behind, which is now empty. A little table is placed close to the head of the bed, with his drinking-glass upon it, and on the wall above the bedstead there is a beautiful sketch of him lying dead. He used to occupy the whole of the second floor. It contains, besides the study and bedroom, an ante-chamber, now furnished with casts and prints on sale, in order to remunerate the custodiers of the house, and a salon tricked out, since his death, with a symbolical cornice, statues, and a carpet worked by the ladies of Weimar. </p><p>Goethe's house is much more important-looking, but, to English eyes, far from being the palatial residence which might be expected, from the descriptions of German writers. The entrance hall is indeed rather imposing, with its statues in niches, and its broad staircase, but the rest of the house is not proportionately spacious and elegant. The only part of the house open to the public and this only on a Friday is the principal suite of rooms which contain his collection of casts, pictures, cameos, &amp;c. This collection is utterly insignificant, except as having belonged to him, and one turns away from bad pictures and familiar casts, to linger over the manuscript of the wonderful R mische Elegien, written by himself in the Italian character. It is to be regretted that a large sum offered for this house by the German Diet, was refused by the Goethe family, in the hope, it is said, of obtaining a still larger sum from that mythical English Cr sus always ready to turn fabulous sums into dead capital, who haunts the imagination of Continental people. One of the most fitting tributes a nation can pay to its great dead, is to make their habitation, like their works, a public possession, a shrine where affectionate reverence may be more vividly reminded that the being who has bequeathed to us immortal thoughts or immortal deeds, had to endure the daily struggle with the petty details, perhaps with the sordid cares of this working-day world; and it is a sad pity that Goethe's study, bedroom, and library, so fitted to call up that kind of sympathy, because they are preserved just as he left them, should be shut out from all but the specially privileged. We were happy enough to be amongst these, to look through the mist of rising tears at the dull study with its two small windows, and without a single object chosen for the sake of luxury or beauty; at the dark little bedroom with the bed on which he died, and the arm-chair where he took his morning coffee as he read; at the library with its common deal shelves, and books containing his own paper marks. In the presence of this hardy simplicity, the contrast suggests itself of the study at Abbotsford, with its elegant gothic fittings, its delicious easy chair, and its oratory of painted glass.</p><p>We were very much amused at the privacy with which people keep their shops at Weimar. Some of them have no kind of enseigne not so much as their names written up; and there is so much nonchalance towards customers, that one might suppose every shopkeeper was a salaried functionary employed by government. The distribution of commodities, too, is carried on according to a peculiar Weimarian logic: we bought our lemons at a seiler's, or ropemaker's, and should not have felt ourselves very unreasonable if we had asked for shoes at a stationer's. As to competition, I should think a clever tradesman or artificer is almost as free from it at Weimar as  sculapius or Vulcan in the days of old Olympus. Here is an illustration. Our landlady's husband was called the 's sser Rabenhorst,' by way of distinguishing him from a brother of his who was the reverse of sweet. This Rabenhorst, who was not sweet, but who nevertheless dealt in sweets, for he was a confectioner, was so utter a rogue that any transaction with him was avoided almost as much as if he had been the Evil One himself, yet so clever a rogue that he always managed to keep on the windy side of the law. Nevertheless, he had so many dainties in the confectionery line so viel S ssigkeiten und Leckerbissen that people bent on giving a fine entertainment were at last constrained to say, 'After all, I must go to Rabenhorst;' and so he got abundant custom, in spite of general detestation.</p><p>A very fair dinner is to be had at several tables d'h te in Weimar for ten or twelve groschen (a shilling or fifteenpence). The Germans certainly excel us in their mehlspeise, or farinaceous puddings, and in their mode of cooking vegetables; they are bolder and more imaginative in their combination of sauces, fruits, and vegetables with animal food, and they are faithful to at least one principle of dietetics variety. The only thing at table we have any pretext for being supercilious about is the quality and dressing of animal food. The meat at a table d'h te in Thuringia, and even Berlin, except in the very first hotels, bears about the same relation to ours as horse-flesh probably bears to German beef and mutton; and an Englishman with a bandage over his eyes would often be sorely puzzled to guess the kind of flesh he was eating. For example, the only flavor we could ever discern in hare, which is a very frequent dish, was that of the more or less disagreeable fat which predominated in the dressing; and roast meat seems to be considered an extravagance rarely admissible. A melancholy sight is a flock of Weimarian sheep, followed or led by their shepherd. They are as dingy as London sheep, and far more skinny; indeed an Englishman who dined with us said the sight of the sheep had set him against mutton. Still, the variety of dishes you get for ten groschen is something marvellous to those who have been accustomed to English charges, and among the six courses it is not a great evil to find a dish or two the reverse of appetizing. I suppose, however, that the living at tables d'h te gives one no correct idea of the mode in which the people live at home. The basis of the national food seems to be raw ham and sausage, with a copious superstratum of blaukraut, sauerkraut, and black bread. Sausage (wurst) seems to be to the German what potatoes were to the Irish the sine qu  non of bodily sustenance. Goethe asks the Frau von Stein to send him so eine wurst when he wants to have a make-shift dinner away from home; and in his letters to Kestner he is enthusiastic about the delights of dining on blaukraut and leberwurst (blue cabbage and liver sausage). If kraut and wurst may be called the solid prose of Thuringian diet, fish and kuchen (generally a heavy kind of fruit tart) are the poetry: the German appetite disports itself with these as the English appetite does with ices and whipped creams.</p><p>At the beginning of August, when we arrived in Weimar, almost every one was away 'at the Baths,' of course except the tradespeople. As birds nidify in the spring, so Germans wash themselves in the summer; their waschungstrieh acts strongly only at a particular time of the year; during all the rest, apparently, a decanter and a sugar-basin or pie-dish, are an ample toilettte service for them. We were quite contented, however, that it was not yet the Weimar 'season,' fashionably speaking, since it was the very best time for enjoying something far better than Weimar gaieties the lovely park and environs. It was pleasant, too, to see the good bovine bourgeoisie enjoying life in their quiet fashion. Unlike our English people, they take pleasure into their calculations, and seem regularly to set aside part of their time for recreation. It is understood that something is to be done in life besides business and housewifery: the women take their children and their knitting to the Erholung, or walk with their husbands to Belvedere, or in some other direction, where a cup of coffee is to be had. The Erholung, by the way, is a pretty garden, with shady walks, abundant seats, an orchestra, a ball-room, and a place for refreshments. The higher classes are subscribers and visitors here as well as the bourgeoisie; but there are several resorts of a similar kind frequented by the latter exclusively. The reader of Goethe will remember his little poem, Die Lustigen von Weimar, which still indicates the round of amusements in this simple capital: the walk to Belvedere or Tiefurt; the excursion to Jena, or some other trip, not made expensive by distance; the round game at cards; the dance; the theatre; and so many other enjoyments to be had by a people not bound to give dinner parties and 'keep up a position.' Another times I will tell what we saw of these recreations, rural and theatrical; of lovely walks along chauss es bordered by plum-trees laden with purple fruit, or by the mountain ash, lifting its bunches of coral against the sky, to country seats where no gate or padlock obstructs your entrance, and no gardener haunts you, expectant of a fee, and to happy-looking villages </p><p>	Each with its little patch of fields</p><p>		And little lot of hills;</p><p>of excursions to the classic Jena and the romantic Ilmenau; and, for a variety, of Weimar fairs and target-shooting, and Wagner operas presided over by Liszt. </p><p>MENANDER  AND  THE  GREEK  COMEDY.  </p><p>Menandre : Etude historique et litteraire sur la Comedie et la Societe Grecques Par M. Guillaume Guizot. 	Paris : Didier,</p><p>THOSE are pleasant epochs in our lives when what has hitherto been a mere name for us becomes the centre for a group of pleasant and fertile ideas--when, for instance, our travels bring us to some southern village which we have only known before as a mark in our map, and from that day forth the once barren word suggests to us a charming picture of houses lit up by a glowing sun, a cluster of tall trees with tame goats browsing on the patch of grass beneath them, and a large stone fountain where dark-complexioned women are filling their pitchers--or when Mr. A. B., whose name we have seen in the visiting-book of an hotel, becomes the definite image of a capital fellow, whose pleasant talk has beguiled a five hours' journey in a diligence, and who turns out to be a man very much like ourselves, with dubious theories, still more dubious hopes, and quite indubitable sorrows. And there is the same sort of pleasure in getting something like a clear conception of an ancient author, whose name has all our life belonged to that inventory of unknown things which so much of our youth is taken up in learning. If we may suppose that to any of our readers Menander has hitherto thus remained a mere nominis umbra, let such readers go to Mr. Guillaume Guizot's very agreeable volume, and they will learn, without the least trouble to themselves, all that scholarly research has hitherto been able to discover of Menander and his writings. It is is true that all the preliminary hard work had been done by Meineke, for what hard work in the way of historical research and criticism has not been done by Germans? They are the purveyors of the raw material of learning for all Europe; but, as Mr. Toots suggests, raw materials require to be cooked, and in this kind of cookery, as well as in the other, the French are supreme. To have the Latin work of a German writer boiled down to a portable bulk and served up in that delicate crystal vessel, the French language, is a benefit that will be appreciated by those who are at all acquainted with the works of Germans, and still more by those who are not acquainted with Latin. This is the service rendered by M. Guillaume Guizot, and the way in which he has performed it quite merits, as it has won, the prize of the French Academy. It is a double pleasure to welcome a young author when he is an exception to that rather melancholy generalisation, that great fathers have insignificant sons; and we think this book on Menander gives some promise that we may one day have to speak familiarly of Guizot the Elder, lest our hearers should confound an illustrious father with an illustrious son.</p><p>In the first chapter of this work, which is only an octavo of about 450 pages, we have the history of Menander's reputation and writings:--the abundant jealousy and the sparing justice awarded him by his contemporaries, his long reign as a "dead but sceptred monarch" over the comic stage, first of Athens and then of Rome, the almost total destruction of his works, first through the bigotry of Byzantine priests and subsequently through the oblivion of Greek literature in the middle ages, and lastly the awakened interest about his works on the revival of !earning, when scholars, amongst whom it is interesting to know that Grotius was one, began to collect the fragments--the disjecti membra poetoe. In the second chapter M. Guizot presents all the accessible details concerning Menander's life and character, details which may be summed up under his early but not unquestioned success as a dramatist, his friendship for Epicurus and Theophrastus, his addiction to pleasure in general, and to the pleasure of loving Glycera in particular. Indeed, if we accept the rather dubious authority of Phraedrus, neither Menander's wisdom nor his wit saved him from being something of a fop; for that fabulist says of him, we hope calumniously, </p><p>	Unguento delibutus, vestitu adfluens,</p><p>	Veniebat gressu delicato et languido;</p><p>which is as much as to say of a man in these days that he scents himself with otto of roses, is fastidious about the cut of his trousers and walks--like a "walking gentleman." This description is strangely at variance with the calm, massive dignity of his fine statue in the Vatican, of which M. Guizot gives us an excellent engraving at the beginniqg of his volume. But then, dear reader, Menander squinted, and where relentless destiny has inflicted a personal defect of that sort, poor human nature is rarely great enough to keep between the two extremes of an attempt to dazzle beholders into oblivion of the defect by finery, and a despairing self-neglect. So, for our parts, we think Menander's foppery belonged to the pathos of his life; and, indeed, what weakness of a great man is not pathetic?  The third chapter discusses the Subjects of the Drama in the three periods of Greek comedy: the ancient period, when its main object was political satire, a form of comedy peculiar to Greece, and made immortal by the genius of Aristophanes; the middle period, when its subjects ceased to be political, and became purely social, but when the manners were chiefly caricature and the characters conventional types, corresponding in many respects to the early comedies of Moliere; and the new period, when it became what the highest modern comedy is, a picture of real domestic life and manners. Of this last species of comedy, Menander was, by the common consent of critics subsequent to his own age, the greatest master Greece ever produced; and the simple statement of this fact is enough to indicate how great a loss is the destruction of his comedies to those who care about a knowledge of Greek life; for Terence, while appropriating the plots and characters and poetry of Menander, threw away all that was specifically Greek and substituted what was specifically Roman. The succeeding chapters on the plot, the characters, the sentiments, and the passions in the Greek drama of the three periods are really fascinating, from the skill with which M. Guizot weaves together his materials and the judgment with which he chooses his illustrative extracts. The fragments of Menander--mere "dust of broken marble" as they are--afford us some interesting glimpses into the Greek interieur of his time. Amongst other things, we gather that the married woman in Greece had then ceased to be a mere piece of furniture, or live stock, too insignificant to determine in any degree a man's happiness or misery. The bitter invectives against women and marriage in the New Comedy are the best--or the worst--proofs of the domestic ascendancy women had acquired. Here is a fragment in which a female emancipationist of that day asserts the rights of woman, according to the moderate views of 300 B.C.:--"Above all if a man is wise, he will not keep his wife too much a prisoner in the recesses of his house. For our eyes take delight in outdoor pleasures. Let a woman have as much as she likes of these pleasures, see everything, and go everywhere. This sight-seeing will of itself satisfy her, and keep her out of mischief; whereas all of us, men, women, and children alike, ardently desire what is hidden from us. But the husband who shuts up his wife under lock and seal, fancying that he shows his prudence in this way, loses his labour, and is a wiseacre for his pains; for if one of us has placed her heart out of the conjugal home, she flies away more swiftly than an arrow or a bird; she would deceive the hundred eyes of Argus! . . . "</p><p>It is amusing also to see how despotic a personage the cook had become in the establishment, giving himself the airs common to people who are conscious of being indispensable. "He who insults one of us," said these mighty functionaries, "never escapes the punishment he deserves: so sacred is our art." They piqued themselves immensely on their skill. Here is a story of one who seems to have been the prototype of that famous French chef who prepared a multifarious dinner tout en boeuf. "I was the pupil of Soterides. One day the King Nicomedes wished to eat some sardines. It was the depth of winter, and twelve days march from the sea. Nevertheless Soterides satisfied the king so completely, that there was a general cry of admiration. Pray how was that possible? He took a radish, cut it into long thin slices, which he shaped like sardines; then, while they were frying, he basted them with oil, sprinkled them with salt very cleverly, threw over them a dozen black poppy seeds, and presented this ragout to the Bythinian appetite of his master. Nicomedes ate the radish, and praised the sardines. You see, cooks differ in nothing from poets: the art of both is equally an art of intelligence." </p><p>In his two last chapters, M. Guizot considers the style and the imitators of Menander, and in an appendix he presents a translation of all the fragments that have any other than a philological interest. Among these there are no fewer than seven hundred and fifty-seven aphorisms, which are preserved to us in greater abundance than other fragments, because they were collected as "beauties" by ancient scholars. Very grave and very melancholy some of these moral sentences are, but probably an equal number of sad and serious sayings might be culled from Moliere. We may say of the highest comedy what Demetrius said in another sense of the satiric drama--that it is [other language], "tragedy in the disguise of mirth." Indeed it may be likened to those choicest of all fruits, the flavour of which is so cunningly mixed by Nature that we know not whether to call them sweet or acid, and in this wonderful equivoque lies their very exquisiteness. </p><p>Among the fragments of Menander there are some passages of elegiac sadness; for example: "0 Parmeno, I call him a happy man, nay, the happiest of all men, who soon returns to the place whence he came, after having contemplated, without sorrow, the magnificence of this world, the sun that everywhere diffuses its beams, the stars, the ocean, the clouds and fire; whether he lives an age or only a few short years, this spectacle will always be the same: never will he see one more sublime. Think of life as</p><p>a fair, where man arrives like a wayfarer: tumult, market, thieves, games of chance and amusements! If thou set out first for the place of halting and </p><p>repose, thou wilt be the better provided for the end of the journey, and thou wilt go without having made enemies. But he who late in the day falls into poverty--a wretched old man, weary, disenchanted and ruined--loses his way, and meets nothing but hatred and snares: a long life leads not to a gentle death." </p><p>But perhaps we are dwelling a little too long on this subject of Menander and Greek Comedy--we should rather say flitting about it a little too long. Let us hope, however, that we have dwelt enough on it to persuade the reader that he will find in M. Guizot's book a masterly treatment of a subject which has a really human and not merely a scholarly interest. </p><p>BELLES LETTRES (JULY 1855). </p><p>EVERY one who was so happy as to go mushrooming in his early days, remembers his delight when, after picking up and throwing away heaps of dubious fungi, dear to naturalists but abhorred of cooks, he pounces on an unmistakeable mushroom, with its delicate fragrance and pink lining tempting him to devour it there and then, to the prejudice of the promised dish for breakfast. We speak in parables, after the fashion of the wise, amongst whom Reviewers are always to be reckoned. The plentiful dubious fungi are the ordinary quarter’s crop of novels, not all poisonous, but generally not appetizing, and certainly not nourishing; and the unmistakeable mushroom is a new novel by Charles Kingsley. It seemed too long since we had any of that genuine description of external nature, not done after the poet’s or the novelist’s recipe, but flowing from spontaneous observation and enjoyment any of that close, vigorous painting of out-door life, which serves as myrrh and rich spices to embalm much perishable theorizing and offensive objurgation—too long since we had a taste of that exquisite lyrical inspiration to which we owe— </p><p>"0, Mary! go and call the cattle home </p><p>Along the sands of Dee.” </p><p>After courses of “psychological” novels (very excellent things in their way), where life seems made up of talking and journalizing, and men are judged almost entirely on "carpet consideration,” we are ready to welcome a stirring historical romance, by a writer who, poet and scholar and social reformer as he is, evidently knows the points of a horse and has followed the hounds, who betrays a fancy for pigs, and becomes dithyrambic on the virtues of tobacco. After a surfeit of Hebes and Psyches, or Madonnas and Magdalens, it is a refreshment to turn to Kiss’s Amazon. But this ruddy and, now and then, rather ferocious barbarism, which is singularly compounded in Mr. Kingsley with the susceptibility of the poet and the warm sympathy of the philanthropist, while it gives his writings once of their principal charms, is also the source of their gravest fault. The battle and the chase seem necessary to his existence; and this Red Man’s nature, planted in a pleasant rectory among corn fields and pastures, takes, in default of better game, to riding down capitalists and Jesuits, and fighting with that Protean personage—“the devil.” If, however, Mother Nature has made Mr. Kingsley very much of a poet and philanthropist, and a little of a savage, her dry-nurse Habit has made him superlatively a preacher: he drops into the homily as readily as if he had been "to the manner born;" and while by his artistic faculty he can transplant you into whatever scene he will, he can never trust to the impression that scene itself will make on you, but, true to his cloth, must always “improve the occasion.” In these two points—his fierce antagonism and his perpetual hortative tendency—lie, to our thinking, the grand mistakes which enfeeble the effect of all Mr. Kingsley's works, and are too likely to impede his production of what his high powers would otherwise promise—a fiction which might be numbered among our classics. Poet and artist in a rare degree, his passionate impetuosity and theological prepossessions inexorably forbid that he should ever be a philosopher; he sees, feels, and paints vividly, but he theorizes illogically and moralizes absurdly. If he would confine himself to his true sphere, he might be a teacher in the sense in which every great artist is a teacher—namely, by giving us his higher sensibility as a medium, a delicate acoustic or optical instrument, bringing home to our coarser senses what would otherwise be unperceived by us. But Mr. Kingsley, unhappily, like so many other gifted men, has two steeds—his Pegasus and his hobby: the one he rides with a graceful abandon, to the admiration of all beholders; but no sooner does he get astride the other, than he becomes a feeble imitator of Carlyle’s manege, and attempts to put his wooden toy to all the wonderful paces of the great Scotchman’s fiery Tartar horse. This imitation is probably not a conscious one, but arises simply from the fact, that Mr. Kingsley’s impetuosity and Boanerges’ vein give him an affinity for Carlyle’s faults—his one-sided judgment of character and his undiscriminating fulminations against the men of the present as tried by some imaginary standard in the past. Carlyle’s great merits Mr. Kingsley's powers are not fitted to achieve; his genius lies in another direction. He has not that piercing insight which every now and then flashes to the depth of things, and alternating as it does with the most obstinate one-sidedness, makes Carlyle a wonderful paradox of wisdom and wilfulness; he has not that awful sense of the mystery of existence which continually checks and chastens the denunciations of the Teufelsdrockh; still less has he the rich humour, the keen satire, and the tremendous word-missiles, which Carlyle hurls about as Milton’s angels hurl the rocks. But Mr. Kingsley can scold; he can select one character for unmixed eulogy and another for unmitigated vituperation; he can undertake to depict a past age and try to make out that it was the pattern of all heroisms now utterly extinct; he can sneer at actual doings which are only a new form of the sentiments he vaunts as the peculiar possession of his pet period; he can call his own opinion God, and the opposite opinion the Devil. Carlyle’s love of the concrete makes him prefer any proper name rather than an abstraction, and we are accustomed to smile at this in him, knowing it to be mere Carlylian rhetoric; but with Mr. Kingsley, who has publicly made a vehement disclaimer of all heterodoxy, and wishes to be understood as believing "all the doctrines of the Catholic Church," we must interpret such phraseology more literally. But enough of general remarks. Let us turn to the particular work before us, where we shall find all the writer’s merits and faults in full blow. We abstain on principle from telling the story of novels, which seems to us something like stealing geraniums from your friend’s flower-pot to stick in your own button-hole: you spoil the effect of his plant, and you secure only a questionable ornament for yourself. We shall therefore be careful to give the reader no hint of the domestic story around which Mr. Kingsley has grouped the historical scenes and characters of "Westward Ho!”</p><p>Hardly any period could furnish a happier subject for an historical fiction than the one Mr. Kingsley has here chosen. It is unhackneyed, and it is unsurpassed in the grandeur of its moral elements, and the picturesqueness and romance of its manners and events. Mr. Kingsley has not brought only genius but much labour to its illustration. He has fed his strong imagination with all accessible material, and given care not only to the grand figures and incidents but to small details. One sees that he knows and loves his Devonshire at first hand, and he has evidently lingered over the description of the forests and savannahs and rivers of the New World, until they have become as vividly present to him as if they were part of his own experience. We dare not pronounce on the merit of his naval descriptions, but to us, landlubbers as we are, they seem wonderfully real, and not to smack at all of technicalities learned by rote over the desk. He has given a careful and loving study to the history and literature of the period, and whatever misrepresentation there is in the book, is clearly not due to ignorance but to prepossession: if he misrepresents, it is not because he has omitted to examine, but because he has examined through peculiar spectacles. In the construction of a story</p><p>Mr. Kingsley has never been felicitous; and the feebleness of his denoucements have been matter of amazement, even to his admirers. In this respect, "Westward Ho!" though by no means criticism-proof, is rather an advance on his former works, especially in the winding-up. It is true, this winding-up reminds us a little of Jane Eyre, but we prefer a partially borrowed beauty to an original bathos, which was what Mr. Kingsley achieved in the later chapters of “Alton Locke” and "Yeast." Neither is humour his forte. His Jack Brimblecombe is too much like a piece of fun obligato, after the manner of Walter Scott, who remains the unequalled model of historical romancists, however they may criticize him. Mr. Kingsley’s necessity for strong loves and strong hatreds, and his determination to hold up certain persons as models, is an obstacle to his successful delineation of character, in which he might otherwise excel. As it is, we can no more believe in and love his men and women than we could believe in and love the pattern-boy at school, always cited as rebuke to our aberrations. Amyas Leigh would be a real, loveablc fellow enough if he were a little less exemplary, and if Mr. Kingsley would not make him a text to preach from, as we suppose he is accustomed to do with Joshua, Gideon, and David. Until he shakes off this parsonic habit he will not be able to create truly human characters, or to write a genuine historical romance. Where his prepossessions do not come into play, where he is not dealing with his model heroes, or where the drama turns on a single passion or motive, he can scarcely be rivalled in truthfulness and beauty of presentation; for in clothing passion with action and language, and in the conception of all that gives local colouring, he has his best gifts to aid him. Beautiful is that episode of Mr. Oxenham’s love, told by Salvation Yeo! Very admirable, too, is the felicity with which Mr. Kingsley has seized the style and spirit of the Elizabethan writers, and reproduced them in the poetry and supposed quotations scattered through his story. But above all other charms in his writings, at least to us, is his scene-painting. Who does not remember the scene by the wood in “Alton Locke,” or that of the hunt at the beginning of “Yeast”? And “Westward Ho!” is wealthy in still greater beauties of the same kind. Here is a perfect gem. After a description of the old house at Stow, the residence of Sir Richard Grenvile, we read— </p><p>"From the house on three sides, the hill sloped steeply down, and the garden where Sir Richard and Amyas were walking gave a truly English prospect. At one turn they could catch, over the western walls, a glimpse of the blue ocean flecked with passing sails; and at the next, spread far below them, range on range of fertile park, stately avenue, yellow autumn woodland, and purple heather moors, lapping over and over each other up the valley to the old British earthwork, which stood black and furze-grown on its conical peak; and standing out against the sky on the highest bank of hill which closed the valley to the east, the lofty tower of Kilkhampton church, rich with the monuments and offerings of five centuries of Grenviles. A yellow eastern haze hung soft over park, and wood, and moor; the red cattle lowed to each other as they stood brushing away the flies in the rivulet far below; the colts in the horse-park close on their right whinnied as they played together, and their sires from the Queen’s park, on the opposite hill, answered them in fuller though fainter voices. A rutting stag made the still woodland rattle with his hoarse thunder, and a rival far up the valley gave back a trumpet note of defiance, and was himself defied from heathery brows which quivered far away above, half seen through the veil of eastern mist. And close at home, upon the terrace before the house, amid romping spaniels and golden-haired children, sat Lady Grenvile herself, the beautiful St. Leger of Annery, the central jewel of all that glorious place, and looked down at her noble children, and then at her more noble husband, and round at that broad paradise of the west, till life seemed too full of happiness, and heaven of light.” </p><p>It is pleasanter to linger over beauties such as these, than to point out faults; but unhappily, Mr. Kingsley’s faults are likely to do harm in other ways than in subtracting from the lustre of his fame, and a faithful reviewer must lift up his voice against them, whether men “will hear, or whether they will forbear." Who that has any knowledge of our history and literature—that has felt his heart beat high at the idea of great crises and great deeds—that has any true recognition of the greatest poetry, and some of the greatest thoughts enshrined in our language, is not ready to pay the tribute of enthusiastic reverence to the Elizabethan age? In his glowing picture of that age, Mr. Kingsley would have carried with him all minds in which there is a spark of nobleness, if he could have freed himself from the spirit of the partisan, and been content to admit that in the Elizabethan age, as in every other, human beings, human parties, and human deeds are made up of the most subtly intermixed good and evil. The battle of Armageddon in which all the saints are to fight on one side, has never yet come. It is perfectly true that, at certain epochs, the relations and tendencies of ideas and events are so clearly made out to minds of any superiority, that the best and ablest men are for the most part ranged under one banner: there was a point at which it must have become disgraceful to a cultivated mind not to accept the Copernican system, and in these days we are unable to draw any favourable inference concerning the intellect or morals of a man who advocates capital punishment for sheep-stealing or forgery. But things have never come to this pass with regard to Catholicism and Protestantism; and even supposing they had, Mr. Kingsley's ethics seem to resemble too closely those of his bugbears the Dominicans, when he implies that it is a holy work for the “Ayes” to hunt down the “Noes” like so many beasts of prey. His view of history seems not essentially to differ from that we have all held in our childish days, when it seemed perfectly easy to us to divide mankind into the sheep and the goats, when we devoutly believed that our favourite heroes, Wallace and Bruce, and all who fought on their side, were “good," while Edward and his soldiers were all “wicked;" that all the champions of the Reformation were of unexceptionable private character, and all the adherents of Popery consciously vicious and base. Doubtless the Elizabethan age bore its peculiar fruit of excellence, as every age has done which forms a nodus, a ganglion, in the historical development of humanity—as the age of Pericles produced the divinest sculptures, or the age of the Roman Republic the severe grandeur of Roman law and Roman patriotism, or as the core of the Middle Ages held the germ of chivalrous honour and reverential love. Doubtless the conquest of the Spanish Armada was virtually the triumph of light and freedom over darkness and bondage. What then? Is this a reason why Mr. Kingsley should seem almost angry with us for not believing with the men of that day in the golden city of Manoa and the Gulf-stream, or scold by anticipation any one who shall dare to congratulate himself on being undeceived in these matters? Doubtless Drake, Hawkins, Frobisher, and the rest, were brave, energetic men—men of great will and in some sort of great faculty; but like all other human agents, they “builded better than they knew;” and it would be as rational to suppose that the bee is an entomological Euclid, interested only in the solution of a problem, as to suppose that the motives of these mariners were as grand as the results of their work. </p><p>We had marked several passages as specimens of the small success which attends Mr. Kingsley in his favourite exercise of deducing a moral, but our want of space obliges us to renounce the idea of quoting them, with the exception of one, which, we think, will in some degree justify our low estimate of Mr. Kingsley’s gifts as a philosophizer. Here is the passage— </p><p>"Humboldt has somewhere a curious passage; in which, looking on some wretched group of Indians, squatting stupidly round their fires, besmeared with grease and paint, and devouring ants and clay, he somewhat naively remarks, that were it not for science, which teaches us that such is the cruel material of humanity, and this the state from which we all have risen, he should have been tempted rather to look upon those hapless beings as the last degraded remnants of some fallen and dying race. One wishes that the great traveller had been bold enough to yield to that temptation, which his own reason and common sense presented to him as the real explanation of the sad sight, instead of following the dogmas of a so-called science, which has not a fact whereon to base its wild notion, and must ignore a thousand facts in asserting it. His own good sense, it seems, coincided instinctively with the Bible doctrine, that man in a state of nature is a fallen being, doomed to death—a view which may be a sad one, but still one more honourable to poor humanity than the theory, that we all began as some sort of two-handed apes. It is surely more hopeful to believe that those poor Otomaes or Guahibas were not what they ought to be, than to behave that they were. It is certainly more complimentary to them, to think that they had been somewhat nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by, than that they were such blockheads as to have dragged on, the son after the father, for all the thousands of years which have elapsed since man was made, without having had wit enough to discover any better food than ants and clay.</p><p>“Our voyagers, however, like those of their time, troubled their heads with no such questions. Taking the Bible story as they found it, they agreed with Humboldt's reason, and not with his science; or, to speak correctly, agreed with Humboldt's self, and not with the shallow anthropologic theories which happened to be in vogue fifty years ago; and their new hosts were in their eyes immortal souls like themselves, 'captivated by the devil at his will,' lost there in the pathless forests, likely to be lost hereafter." </p><p>Note the accuracy of Mr. Kingsley's reasoning. Humboldt observes that, but for scientific data leading to an opposite conclusion, he could have imagined that a certain group of Indians were the remnants of a race which had sunk from a state of well-being to one of almost helpless barbarism. Hereupon, Mr. Kingsley is sorry that Humboldt did not reject "the dogmas of a so-called science," and rest in this conception which "coincided with the Bible doctrine;" and he urges as one of his reasons for this regret, that it would be complimentary to the Otomacs and Guahibas to suppose that in centuries gone by, they had been nobler and more prudent. Now, so far as we are acquainted with the third chapter of Genesis, and with the copious exegeses of that chapter from St. Paul downwards, the "Bible doctrine" is not that man multiplied on the earth and formed communities and nations-amongst the rest, noble and prudent societies of Otomacs and Guahibas-in a state of innocence, and that then came the Fall. We have always understood that for the Fall "we may thank Adam," and that consequently the very first Otomac or Guahiba was already "captivated by the devil," and "likely to be lost hereafter." Hence, what the question of the Otomacs and Guahibas having been nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by, can have to do with the doctrine of the Fall, we are at a loss to perceive. We will do no more than point to Mr. Kingsley's cool arrogance in asserting that a man like Humboldt, the patriarch of scientific investigators, is "misled by the dogmas of a so-called science, which has not a fact whereon to base its wild notions." Indeed it is rather saddening to dwell on the occasional absurdities into which anomalous opinions can betray a man of real genius; and after all, the last word we have to say of "Westward Ho!" is to thank Mr. Kingsley for the great and beautiful things we have found in it, as our dominant feeling towards his works in general is that of high admiration. </p><p>Next in interest to "Westward Ho!" at least among the English novels of the quarter, is "Constance Herbert." Miss Jewsbury has created precedents for herself which makes critics exacting towards her. We measure her work by her own standard, and find it deficient; when if measured by the standard of ordinary feminine novelists, it would perhaps seem excellent. We meet with some beauties in it which, coming from the author of the "Half Sisters," we take as a matter of course, but we miss other beauties which she has taught us to expect; we feel that she is not equal to herself; and it is a tribute to her well-attested powers if we dwell on what has disappointed us, rather than on what has gratified us. An easy, agreeable style of narrative, some noble sentiments expressed in the quiet, unexaggerated way that indicates their source to be a deep spring of conviction and experience, not a mere rain-torrent of hearsay enthusiasm, with here and there a trait of character or conduct painted with the truthfulness of close observation, are merits enough to raise a book far above the common run of circulating library fiction; but they are not enough to make a good novel, or one worthy of Miss Jewsbury's reputation. "Constance Herbert" is a Tendenz-roman; the characters and incidents are selected with a view to the enforcement of a principle. The general principle meant to be enforced is the unhesitating, uncompromising sacrifice of inclination to duty, and the special case to which this principle is applied in the novel, is the abstinence from marriage where there is an inheritance of insanity. So far, we have no difference of opinion with Miss Jewsbury. But the mode in which she enforces the principle, both theoretically in the Envoi and illustratively in the story of her novel, implies, we think, a false view of life, and virtually nullifies the very magnanimity she inculcates. "If," she says in the Envoi, "we have succeeded in articulating any principle in this book, it is to entreat our readers to have boldness to act up to the sternest requirements that duty claims as right. Although it may at the time seem to slay them, it will in the end prove life. Nothing they renounce for the sake of a higher principle, will prove to have been worth the keeping." The italics are ours, and we use them to indicate what we think false in Miss Jewsbury's moral. This moral is illustrated in the novel by the story of three ladies, who, after renouncing their lovers, or being renounced by them, have the satisfaction of feeling in the end that these lovers were extremely “good-for-nothing,” and that they (the ladies) have had an excellent riddance. In all this we can see neither the true doctrine of renunciation, nor a true representation of the realities of life; and we are sorry that a writer of Miss Jewsbury’s insight and sincerity should have produced three volumes for the sake of teaching such copy-book morality. It is not the fact that what duty calls on us to renounce, will invariably prove “not worth the keeping,” and if it were the fact, renunciation would cease to be moral heroism, and would be simply a calculation of prudence. Let us take the special case which Miss Jewsbury has chosen as her illustration. It might equally happen that a woman in the position of Constance Herbert, who renounces marriage because she will not entail on others the family heritage of insanity, had fixed her affections, not on an egotistic, shallow worldling like Philip Marchmont, but on a man who was fitted to make the happiness of a woman’s life, and whose subsequent career would only impress on her more and more deeply the extent of the sacrifice she had made in refusing him. And it is this very perception that the thing we renounce is precious, is something never to be compensated to us, which constitutes the beauty and heroism of renunciation. The only motive that renders such a resolution as Constance Herbert’s noble, is that keen sympathy with human misery which makes a woman prefer to suffer for the term of her own life, rather than run the risk of causing misery to an indefinite number of other human beings; and a mind influenced by such a motive will find no support in the very questionable satisfaction of discovering that objects once cherished were in fact worthless. The notion that duty looks stern, but all the while has her hand full of sugar-plums, with which she will reward us by-and-by, is the favourite cant of optimists, who try to make out that this tangled wilderness of life has a plan as easy to trace as that of a Dutch garden; but it really undermines all true moral development by perpetually substituting something extrinsic as a motive to action, instead of the immediate impulse of love or justice, which alone makes an action truly moral. This is a grave question to enter on a proper of a novel; but Miss Jewsbury is so emphatic in the enunciation of her moral, that she forces us to consider her book rather in the light of a homily than of a fiction—to criticise her doctrine rather than her story. On another point, too, we must remonstrate with her a little, chiefly because we value her influence, and should like to see it always in what seems to us the right scale. With the exception of Mr. Harrop, who is simply a cipher awaiting a wife to give him any value, there is not a man in her book who is not either weak, perfidious, or rascally, while almost all the women are models of magnanimity and devotedness. The lions, i.e., the ladies, have got the brush in their hands with a vengeance now, and are retaliating for the calumnies of men from Adam downwards. Perhaps it is but fair to allow them a little exaggeration. Still we must meekly suggest that we cannot accept an ex parte statement, even from that paragon Aunt Margaret, as altogether decisive. Aunt Margaret tells us that in the bloom of youth and beauty, with virtues and accomplishments to correspond, she alienated her husband by pure devotion to him. “No man," she says, “can bear entire devotion.” This reminds us of a certain toper, who after drinking a series of glasses of brandy-and-water one night, complained the next morning that the water did not agree with him. We are inclined to think that it is less frequently devotion which alienates men, than something infused in the devotion—a certain amount of silliness, or temper, or exigeance, for example, which, though given in small doses, will, if persevered in, have a strongly alterative effect. Men, in fact, are in rather a difficult position: in one car a Miss Grace Lee, or some such strong-minded woman, thunders that they demand to be worshipped, and abhor a woman who has any self-dependence; on the other, a melancholy Viola complains that they never appreciate devotion, that they care only for a woman who treats them with indifference. A discouraging view of the case for both sexes! Seriously, we care too much for the attainment of a better understanding as to woman’s true position, not to be sorry when a writer like Miss Jewsbury only adds her voice to swell the confusion on this subject.</p><p>“The merits of "Thorney Hall" are of the negative kind. It is not sentimental, not inflated, not religio-didactic: it has no pretension to be anything else than a story of ordinary life, with its inward and outward trials, its mistakes and misfortunes. But this one pretension it fails to make good; its scenes and characters are vague and shadowy; they neither remind us of our own experience nor make us believe in them as the experience of another. However, those who are looking out for a one-volumed novel, which will not disturb the initiation of the digestive process, and is likely, by-and-by, to lull them into their siesta, will find "Thorney Hall" unexceptionable for their purpose. </p><p>"Our World; or, the Democrat’s Rule,” is an American novel which will attract only those readers who can be induced to linger over scenes more painful than the most painful in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” by any slighter motive than a stern necessity for becoming acquainted with the facts of a special case. Compared with the perverted feeling shown in the choice of such subjects, we can tolerate the milk-and-water triviality of “Married Women.” We suppose there is still a public for novels like this among the clients of the circulating libraries in provincial towns; and, after all, an interest in such feeble creations is better than blank ennui or indulgence in acrid gossip. After this home-made gooseberry,it is curious to taste the fine old crusted port (not without bee’s wing) of Cervantes' “Exemplary Novels," which Mr. Bohn gives us in one of his extra volumes, or the double stout of De Foe’s works, of which a new volume, containing "Roxana," and the "Life and Adventures of Mrs. Christian Davies,” has appeared in the same publisher's "British Classics." A propos of the "British Classics" (not a propos of novels), we may mention that another new issue of that series is the fourth volume of Addison’s Works, edited by Bishop Hurd. </p><p>Emile Souvestre is deservedly a favourite writer in England. The translation of his “Leaves from a Family Journal,” which appeared last quarter, is now followed by a translation of "Tales and Sketches” by him, illustrative of scenery and manners in Britanny and La Vendée, published in that attractive series, Constable's Miscellany of Foreign Literature. The beautiful paper and type, and the convenient size of the volume, make these pleasant tales seem all the more readable—in happy contrast with the getting up of German books which you can only read in spite of the fact that they fall to pieces before you have turned over half-a-dozen pages.</p><p>The name of Matthew Arnold on a volume of Poems is a sufficient recommendation to the notice of all those who are careful to supply themselves with poetry of a new vintage, so we need not regret, except on our own account, that we have made rather a late acquaintance with his Second Series of Poems, published last quarter. If we had written of these poems after reading them only once, we should have given them a tepid kind of praise, but after reading them again and again, we have become their partizan, and are tempted to be intolerant of those who will not admit their beauty. Our first impression from a poem of Mr. Arnold’s—and with some persons this is the sole impression-generally is, that it is rather tame and prosaic. The thought is always refined and unhackneyed, sometimes new and sublime, but he seems not to have found the winged word which carries the thought at once to the mind of the reader; his poems do not come to us like original melodies, which are beautiful facts that one never thinks of altering any more than a pine-tree or a river; we are haunted by the feeling that he might have said the same thing much better. But when, simply for the sake of converse with a nature so gifted and cultivated as Mr. Arnold's, we linger over a poem which contains some deep and fresh thought, we begin to perceive poetic beauties-felicities of expression and description, which are too quiet and subdued to be seized at the first glance. You must become familiar with his poems before you can appreciate them as poetry, just as in the early spring you must come very near to the woods before you can discern the delicate glossy or downy buds which distinguish their April from their winter clothing. He never attains the wonderful word-music of Tennyson, which lives with you like an Adelaide of Beethoven, or a Preghiera of Rossini; but his combinations and phrases are never common, they are fresh from the fountain, and call the reader’s mind into new activity. Mr. Arnold’s grand defect is want of rhythm——we mean of that rhythm which is music to an English ear. His imitations of the classical metres can no more win a place in our lasting national poetry than orange and olive-trees can flourish in our common English gardens; and his persistence in these imitations is, we think, a proof that he lacks that fine sense of word-music, that direct inspiration of song, as distinguished from speech, which is the crowning gift of the poet. </p><p>This Second Series is not equal, though it is a worthy companion,to the first; there is no poem in it so fine as "Zohrab and Rustum,” or "Tristan and Iseult;” but in putting the volume into the hands of a reader to whom Mr. Arnold’s poems were new, we should point to “Resignation,” and to “The Last Glen,” and “Typho” in “The Harp-player on Aetna," as favourable specimens of the author‘s power in two directions—the expression of exquisite sensibility united with deep thought, in which he reminds us of Wordsworth, and the revivifying of antique conceptions by freshly-felt descriptions of external nature and masterly indications of permanent human feeling, after the manner of Tennyson. We steal space for the sake of quoting two passages from "Resignation:”— </p><p>“The Poet, to whose mighty heart </p><p>Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart, </p><p>Subdues that energy to scan </p><p>Not his own course, but that of Man. </p><p>From some high station he looks down, </p><p>At sunset, on a populous town; </p><p>Surveys each happy group that fleets, </p><p>Toil ended, through the shining streets, </p><p>Each with some errand of his own;-</p><p>And does not say, I am alone. </p><p>He sees the gentle stir of birth </p><p>When Morning purifies the earth; </p><p>He leans upon a gate, and sees </p><p>The pastures, and the quiet trees. </p><p>Low woody hill, with gracious bound, </p><p>Folds the still valley almost round: </p><p>The cuckoo, loud on some high lawn, </p><p>Is answer'd from the depth of dawn; </p><p>In the hedge straggling to the stream, </p><p>Pale, dew-drench’d, half-shut roses gleam: </p><p>But where the further side slopes down </p><p>He sees the drowsy new-wak’d clown </p><p>In his white quaint-embroider‘d frock </p><p>Make, whistling, towards his mist-wreath’d flock; </p><p>Slowly, behind the heavy tread </p><p>The wet flower’d grass heaves up its head.— </p><p>Lean’d on his gate, he gazes: tears </p><p>Are in his eyes, and in his ears </p><p>The murmur of a thousand years: </p><p>Before him he sees Life unroll, </p><p>A placid and continuous whole: </p><p>That general Life, which does not cease, </p><p>Whose secret is not joy, but peace; </p><p>That Life, whose dumb wish is not miss'd </p><p>If birth proceeds, if things subsist: </p><p>The Life of plants, and stones, and rain: </p><p>The Life he craves; if not in vain </p><p>Fate gave, what Chance shall not controul, </p><p>His sad lucidity of soul. </p><p>"Enough, we live:——and if a life, </p><p>With large results so little rife, </p><p>Though bearable, seem hardly worth </p><p>This pomp of worlds, this pain of birth; </p><p>Yet, Fausta, the mute earth we tread, </p><p>The solemn hills around us spread, </p><p>This stream that falls incessantly, </p><p>The strange-scrawl’d rocks, the lonely sky, </p><p>If I might lend their life a voice, </p><p>Seem to bear rather than rejoice. </p><p>And even could the intemperate prayer </p><p>Man iterates, while these forbear, </p><p>For movement, for an ample sphere, </p><p>Pierce Fate’s impenetrable ear; </p><p>Not milder is the general lot </p><p>Because our spirits have forgot, </p><p>In action’s dizzying eddy whirl’d, </p><p>The something that infects the world.” </p><p>The transition from Matthew Arnold to Chaucer is not a startling one, for our modern school of poets are more obviously the lineal descendants of the Father of English Poetry than many poets who were nearer to him chronologically. We have been struck with special indications of this kinship in turning over the four volumes of Chaucer which form the last issue of Mr. Robert Bell’s excellent and attractive annotated edition of the English poets—excellent from the careful and agreeable manner in which the editor performs his labour of illustrating and commenting, and attractive from the clearness of the type and the comfortable pocket-size of the volumes. Poets, of all writers, should be given to us in a portable shape; we study them less at our desk than under the branching shade of a beech or a chesnut, or when we are resting in our easy chair from the fatigues of prosaic life, or still more prosaic learning; and in such circumstances we shudder at a double-columned royal octavo, or at an edition which scatters our favourite passages in majestic type through ten or twelve cumbrous volumes. Those who share our taste will find in Mr. Bell’s edition of Chaucer precisely what they want. The editor, after much consideration, has wisely decided on leaving Chaucer’s orthography intact, attempts at modernizing being impossible without injury to the metre, and without settling questions which the balance of opinion demands should be left open. Chaucer himself has left what may be construed into an appeal against any tampering with his English:—</p><p>“And for there is so great diversity </p><p>In English, and in writing of our tongue, </p><p>So I pray God that none miswrite thee </p><p>Ne thee mismetre for defaut of tongue;” </p><p>and this is at least a hint that with him, as with all true poets, the minutest details of language are as essential to his creation as the skin to the beauty of the human form. Mr. Bell promises to give, at the end of his final volume, a glossary which has been revised by the light of the latest researches into our mediaeval language and provincial dialects; and with this, added to the Introduction and Notes, the reader will find himself in possession of all necessary aids to the enjoyment of Chaucer. The notes are brief and really enlightening. Mr. Bell does not incessantly invite your eye to the bottom of the page in order to expatiate on something quite beside the question; but wherever you are conscious of fogginess, you find a reference to a note which detains you from the text only just so long as is necessary. We must except the case of words which, we suppose, will be contained in the glossary—an exception which is a considerable disadvantage to readers who can have only one volume at hand at a time, but which probably was inevitable. On the whole, the thoroughness with which this “Annotated Edition of the English Poets" is projected, and hitherto carried out, does honour to the publishers’ taste and spirit, as well as to Mr. Bell’s ability and conscientiousness. </p><p>The same skies that make our garden flowers flourish encourage the growth of weeds, and so a time that produces real poets has generally a large crop of versifiers, whom the Reviewer must resignedly expect as so much inevitable chickweed or dandelion which will spring up round the heliotropes and anemones. On laying down Matthew Arnold, for example, we had to take up Mr. A. M. Morgan, who tells us on superfine paper and in neat type that </p><p>"a mighty citadel, </p><p>A throbbing nation’s eagle eye </p><p>To focus half humanity </p><p>Hath evermore a nameless spell;” </p><p>and who has the audacity to inscribe “From the German of Goethe”—meaning, we suppose, Mignon’s divine song, "So lasst mich scheinen bis ich werde,”—over stanzas like this: </p><p>“Farewell, my own dear mother earth, </p><p>Sweet children, farewell ye! </p><p>The breath of spring, the voice of mirth </p><p>Too soon shall charm not me.” </p><p>Again, Mr. William Ball, a “Lake Poet,” makes “accessible to some inquiry" beyond the circle of private friends, a thick volume of verse, in which he boldly invokes the muse on such subjects as “Macaulay on William Penn” and “Exeter v. Gorham,” and in a long poem called "The Transcript," turns into blank verse the doctrines of the Anti-State-Church Association in this style:—</p><p>“Law makes a priest the gospel that betrays; </p><p>Schools may make clergy; Heaven makes ministers. </p><p>Tell not of Simony: who sells the gift </p><p>May sell the living too: ’tis man made all, </p><p>Throughout the cold dry clauses of the Act </p><p>That settles and maintains a Church by law.” </p><p>“Echoes of the War" are unpretending rhymes, which seem to be the sincere response of a warm British heart to the tales of noble deeds, and nobly endured suffering, which have come to us from the Crimea. The poem on Inkermann is an easy, spirited ballad of the kind we wish our war poets had hit on more frequently, instead of the highflown metaphysical strain. The war has called forth little poetry such as our sons may learn along with "Hohenlinden” and “The Burial of Sir John Moore.” </p><p>Under the title of “Passing Thoughts," "Mr. James Douglas, of Cavers, prints what might have been a series of magazine articles on miscellaneous subjects. The "Passing Thoughts" on Goethe and Rousseau were certainly not worth arresting, but those on Italy show some largeness of view and some feeling for the beautiful. </p><p>“Once on a time,” says a fabulist, “the cattle grazing on a large common, agreed to admit a good number of donkeys into their society. An old race-horse, indeed, neighed some objections, but they were overcome by a placid bullock trained to the harness, who suggested, that as donkeys were numerous and there was plenty of pasture on the common, it was but fair to let them have a bite and to put up with a little braying now and then. So the donkeys were treated in a friendly way, till one of them gave himself airs of importance, kicked up behind, offered to run races with the horses, and kept up such a loud and continuous braying, that he was unanimously voted a nuisance, and driven off the common with kicks and blows.” We use this fable to intimate why we show less tolerance to Mr. C.W. Fullom than to many other utterly unqualified authors who come under our notice. An obscure writer who announces himself through a string of newspaper puffs, which insinuate that he has “taken the town by storm," and that “his career of fame continues unchecked,”—who has the audacity to call a book stuffed with vulgar anecdotes and vulgar errors, the mere froth and scum of historical reading, a "History of Woman," and to prefix to it a preface, in which he says, with an air of grave patronage, that he has not chosen to “harass and perplex" the reader by a citation of authorities, but that, “should it be thought desirable, they can be given more fully in another edition”—such a writer becomes insufferable from the mere loudness of his braying. Mr. Fullom’s mastery of language and style may be judged of from the following specimens. He tells us that “the four rivers of Moses now baffle identity;" that "the military success of a hero ignored his crimes;” that "three queens of England, though all of foreign extraction, accompanied their consorts to the battle-ground of the East;” and that Pericles, while he denied Aspasia his purse, "so entirely reciprocated her affection, that he never entered or quitted her house without saluting her." Perhaps in his next edition, when the public has become sufficiently accustomed to the brilliancy of Mr. Fullom’s erudition to bear the additional blaze of his "authorities,” he will tell us from what ancient author he gathers that knowledge of the precise amount of Aspasia’s affection, which enables him to pronounce that a salute on entering and leaving her house was an exact equivalent. We shall also be glad to learn in what edition of Plato we shall find the "Symposiacs" to which Mr. Fullom refers on the sixth page of his first volume. The rich string of authorities that he could cite "an’ if he would,” may be inferred from the use he has made of the sources he does mention. He tells as a piece of veridical history the fable of Pope Joan, though Gibbon, of whom, as well as of Plato and Herodotus, he "talks familiarly, as maidens do of puppy dogs,” might have told him better. Another of Mr. Fullom’s "facts” by which he offers to aid us in ascertaining "the effect of the female character on human progress at particular periods,” is the story of St. Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins. But these stories are highly relevant and appropriate, compared with the mass (we had almost written mess) of matter in these volumes, especially the second, where the writer hops through history from the days of Hypatia to those of Josephine, apparently without any other guide than the fact that his scraps of knowledge here and there give him stepping-stones through the immeasurable morass of his ignorance. At Josephine he stops, from exhaustion, he tells us, "not of the subject," but of his "limited space”——limited apparently from his having been so extravagant as to widen the spaces between his lines (in printers’ phrase, "leading”) in the last forty pages of his second volume. It is not worth while to detain our readers longer over such a book; it has been our duty to examine it precisely for the sake of saving them from wasting their time upon it, and indeed, to adopt the equivocal compliment paid by a newspaper critic to another of Mr. Fullom’s productions, the "History of Woman” "offers a forcible instance of what has to be surmounted in the journey of life,"-by a devoted reviewer.</p><p>The most important work amongst the contributions of French literature on our table, is a volume which has obtained the prize of the French Academy. It is a study of Menander, in which M. Guillaume Guizot very ably popularizes the labours of Meineke. Lessing’s fable of the blind hen industriously scratching up the grain which the alert cock forthwith appropriates, retains its application to the laborious German scholar, and his facile interpreter the Frenchman. In M. Guizot’s moderately sized volume of very easy reading, those who, like Goldsmith's professor, manage to eat, drink, and sleep well without the aid of Greek, may learn perhaps as much as they care to know about Menander, and may gather withal an intelligent conception of Greek Comedy, Ancient, Middle, and New. An appendix contains a translation of the Fragments—many of them were chips from a marble statue, others, like a finger or a piece of muscular neck, revealing the hand of the master. One very numerous class of fragments, amounting to between seven and eight hundred, are the vapar poyooixm, or moral sentiments and aphorisms contained in a single verse or sentence, which we owe to the anthologies compiled by ancient grammarians (as we absurdly call the ypapparmu, or literary men of Greece). Moliere, we are told, after the success of his Précieuscs ridicules, said: "Je n’ai plus que faire d’étudier Plaute et Terence, ni d’éplucher les fragments de Ménandre;” and in turning over these fragments one understands how they might give precious hints to a creative genius, for even to more passive and obtuse readers they are very suggestive. M. Guizot first presents a history of Menander’s fame and works. Like so many other chefs-d'oeuvre, his comedies were far from attaining popularity at once; the mediocrities of his contemporary, Philemon, were generally preferred; and of a hundred and five comedies written by Menander, only eight carried off the prize. The devices of barren critics have always been the same: first, Menander was too young; then he was a plagiarist; then he held the pernicious doctrines of Epicurus; then his life was immoral. Everything was easier to prove than that he had written bad comedies. Menander avenged himself by asking Philemon: “Do you not sometimes blush when your comedies are preferred to mine?” and the next age avenged him by placing him at the head of all comic dramatists. The celebrated critic, Aristophanes, ranked him even next to Homer; his comedies were performed at private banquets as well as on the stage; and, four centuries after Menander’s day, Plutarch, in an enthusiastic eulogy, said, that at such banquets they were equally acceptable to the graver judgment of the sober guests and the rather riotous spirits of the winebibbers. It was the critic Aristophanes, by the way, who applied to Menander the graceful compliment, which has since been so often borrowed, and paid to forgotten immortals: O Menander! O Life! which of you has imitated the other?” Equally ardent admiration was given to Menander in Rome, and his comedies became the model for Roman imitators, or rather the quarry for Roman “adapters.” Terence, whom Caesar intended to compliment by addressing him as dimidiate Menander, being, as every one knows, the arch-adapter, who made such pillage respectable. Many comedies of Menander survived the destructive bigotry of the Christians so late even as the middle of the twelfth century, when they were frequently cited by the Archbishop Eustathius, in his Commentary on the “Iliad” and “Odyssey.” After that time, there is no reliable trace of their existence; and unless some happy accident should reveal at Mount Athos, or elsewhere, an entire manuscript of a comedy or comedies of Menander, our literary Cuviers are reduced to a merely imaginary reconstruction of the whole to which the disjocti membra poetae belonged.</p><p>M. Guizot next knits together the scattered threads of information concerning Menander's life and character—his early authorship (his first dramatic prize having been won when he was only twenty-one); his friendship with Epicurus and Theophrastus; his luxurious habits; his love of Glycera, the celebrated hetaira, whom he introduced into one of his comedies; his refusal to leave Athens for the sake of honours at the court of Ptolemy Lagus; and his accidental death by drowning, at the age of fifty-two, when he was bathing in the Piraeus, on the borders of which the Athenians erected his tomb, near to that of Euripides. According to Suidas, Menander was mpaog rag oEug—in plain English, he squinted; but the same writer is careful to add that he was aimrow wow, that is to say, he had no mental squint, which unhappily can co-exist with the most symmetrical pair of eyes. We are amused to see the way in which M. Guizot expatiates on an anecdote told by Athenaeus. Menander, says that ancient gossip and gourmand, coming in one day, as great and small men will sometimes do, hipped and out of humour, Glycera offered him some warmed milk, which he refused because of the wrinkled skin which gathers on the surface of boiled milk; whereupon Glycera, like a sensible woman, said: “Blow, and take the milk under." On reading this anecdote, M. Guizot tells us, he is no longer astonished that Charlotte fascinated Werther while she was cutting bread and butter; before this, probably he had thought with Lord Jeffrey, that the author of Werther was “not a gentleman.” </p><p>To understand the position and merit of Menander as a comic dramatist, it is necessary to know something of the development of Greek comedy from its embryonic condition in the Bacchic hymns; and accordingly M. Guizot considers in succession the subjects, plan, and characters of the Greek comedy in the ancient and middle period as well as in the new, to which Menander belonged. The ancient comedy, represented by Aristophanes, occupied itself almost entirely with political subjects: it was a dramatised criticism and satire of public men and public measures—the acted "Punch" or "Charivari" of Athens. The characters were either personifications in which there was the most daring combination of extravagant fancy with acutely portrayed reality, or outrageous caricatures of well-known individuals; personal attack was its essence; the public weal was the only thing it held sacred. After the Peloponnesian war, when Athens had lost its supremacy and the Athenians had exchanged the proud sense of self-government for a prosperous subordination, this form of comedy was no longer possible, and dramatic talent took for its object not public life, but life in public-the types of character and the habits which form the elements of social life, as distinguished from political and domestic life. The courtesan, the fishmonger (the bete noire of the Athenian market), the parasite, the drunkard, the foreign visitor at Athens, the peasant, were the favourite types of the middle comedy; and when it dealt with philosophers and literary men, the object was not, as in the ancient comedy, to impale them as pernicious to the commonwealth, but simply to hold up to laughter their fine-spun distinctions and the affectations of their style. The new comedy had much in common with the middle, but to the satire of vices and absurdities, to the acute perception and delineation of characteristics, Menander added the profound comprehension of character, the sense of beauty, and the pathos which are essential to high comedy; in fact, he was the Moliere of antiquity. But in Moliere, as well as in Menander, we find many of the specific features of the middle Greek comedy. Here, for example, is a passage from a comic dramatist of the middle period, which one might imagine to have been extracted from Moliere, if indeed it is not more like our English ridicule of Hegel. A father asks his son:—</p><p>"'What worthy employment do you speak of? Passing your days in the Lyceum with the sophists, a half-starved race who eat nothing but figs? And what do you talk about there?’—Son. ‘That which becomes, is not, for that which becomes cannot be while it is becoming; and if, to speak absolutely, that which becomes, was formerly, it was not at least what it becomes at this moment, for nothing can be without being, or can become what it is already. But that which is not become, is not; and, in fact, how can that have become which has not become? For, in order to become, it is necessary first to be, and if the first state of being is wanting, how can being arise out of non-being? It is impossible. If, then, a thing, from being what it is, becomes something else, in future it will not be. But some one will say to me here:-And non-being? If one day it becomes, what will it become?-Non-being will not become; for from the day in which it became, it would be, and non-being would not be itself.' 'Hold!' cries the father, 'Apollo himself could make nothing of such reasoning.'" </p><p>And here again is a passage, satirizing the rage for periphrasis, which might have come from the same mint as the Precieuses ridicules:- </p><p>"A. Shall! I say-a mixture of the fair sweets of honey and the tears which flow from the teats of the bleating goats, placed on a large napkin of flour, ehaste daughter of Ceres, and ornamented with a thousand delicate knick-knacks? or shall I say-a cake?-B. A cake; I like it better.-A. Will you take the drops perspired from the springs of Bacchus?-B. Abridge; say wine.-A. Or the moist dew of the fountain?" &amp;c. </p><p>The fishmonger was the favorite butt of the middle comedy; nothing is too hyperbolical to convey an idea of his stupendous impudence and the profound cunning of the ruses by which he evaded the law:- </p><p>"Does the law forbid them to water their fish?-Yes; but no sooner does one of these shameless men see his fish getting dry, than he picks a quarrel on the spot; it soon comes to blows, and suddenly, making believe that he has received a mortal blow, he falls down amongst his fish as if stunned. 'Water! water!' is the cry. A comrade seizes a bucket, scarcely sprinkles the pretended dying man, and inundates the fish, so that you would vow they had been fished the moment before!" </p><p>One of the novelties introduced into the comedy by Menander was the prominent position he gave to women; he was wise enough to see that they were necessary to any varied and romantic interest in his plays. Not that he is complimentary to women; on the contrary, a large proportion of his remaining fragments are rather sharp epigrams on women and marriage. But the very bitterness of the new comedy on these subjects is a proof how important woman had become, how erroneous the notion is, that the married woman in Greece was never anything more than a pampered slave. In the ancient comedy, and generally in the middle, the character of a wife is no theme for satire or invective; it was a matter of too much indifference. The husband could turn the key on her whenever he liked, and find the main objects of his life elsewhere. But clearly, in the period of Alexander's successors, which was the period of the new comedy, something very like hen-pecking was not foreign to the experience of Greek husbands. One feels especial interest in reading the pathetic fragments of Menander, several of which are expansions of his often-quoted passage: "Whom the gods love, die young." But we must allow ourselves no more quotations, and will only tell the reader that M. Guizot's two last chapters are occupied with the style of Menander, the strong influence of Euripides on his writings, and his various imitators, Greek and Roman.</p><p>"Tolla" is a perfectly charming tale, by M. Edmond About, a young writer already known by an interesting book of travel in Greece. The incidents of this little story, which forms only a small volume of this "Bibliotheque des Chemins de Fer," are very simple, but they are made of absorbing interest by the artistic mastery with which the writer transports us beneath the skies of Italy, and shows us the life of the modern Italian grandee, or the romantic barbarism still existing in the Italian peasant; by the living, unexaggerated reality of the characters; and by the pure and tender spirit which breathes through the whole narrative, and tempers the French point and vivacity of the style. Since George Sand's "Andre" we remember no picture of a character at once amiable, infirm, and selfish, superior to this of Lello, and the delicacy of the touches which indicate the love of the peasant Menico for his high-born mistress, is a kind of excellence which Sand has never attained. We hope and believe that "Tolla" is only the first of many beautiful stories for which we will have to thank M. Edmond About: a bit of virgin gold like this tells of a rich mine yet to be worked. We turned with some expectation to another volume of the same series, containing some translations of Danish tales, thinking that we should perhaps find in them some fresh local colouring in so unhackneyed a region as Denmark. Frederika Bremer and Hans Christian Andersen, with all their faults, have given us an inclination for Scandinavian fiction. These "Nouvelles Danoises," however, are nothing more than love stories of the very flimsiest texture, impressing one simply with the strong family resemblance there is between poor writers of all nations. In the same cheap form is republished Theophile Gautier's little tale, "Militona," which opens with a fascinating picture of Spanish life, but falls off terribly towards the end. How is it that novels and tales are so often like the baskets of strawberries which tempt the thirsty pedestrian at Kew or elsewhere on a bright summers’ day—all inviting, ripe, and fresh at the beginning, and, as you near the end, poor, crude, and stale? Perhaps many reasons might be given for the declension, if this were a place for a dissertation on the subject; but at present we merely remark on the fact, as a hint to any reader who may have an unfinished novel on the anvil. </p><p>The supply of German literature this quarter is unusually meagre. "Werther und seine Zeit" is a small volume which gives us, without the vehicle of irrelevant prolixity in which the contributions to Goethe-Literatur are generally presented, the whole bibliography of “Werther;” an account of the various translations and criticisms—in fact, the entire fortunes of the book from its first appearance up to Mr. Bohn’s edition of it in the “Standard Library;” and also some new details concerning Goethe's Wetzlar acquaintances, which will be interesting to the few readers who make Goethe-literature a special study. We cannot equally recommend Herr Hartung’s "Ungele-hrte Erklarung des Goethe’schen Faust:” he makes the common mistake of being too scanty in real illustration and too diffuse in paraphrase. </p><p>If there are any readers of Gowdie-Castle and St. Roche who are curious for information about the authoress, Frau Paalzow, they will find it in a small volume entitled "Ein Schriftsteller-Leben," which contains a short sketch of her life and a collection of her letters, chiefly occupied with her little anxieties and satisfactions as an authoress. A selection of original novels, under the title of the Deutsche Bibliothek, has now reached the sixth volume, which closes the first series. Among the writers engaged, perhaps the best known in England are Leopold Schefer and Theodor Mugge, the latter of whom contributed the first volume—“Afraja,” a story of Lapland life, which excited much attention from its freshness, and has been translated into English. The fifth and sixth volumes contain “Die Freimaurer” and “Die Familie Ammer.” Each novel of the series is complete in one volume, of unusually good paper, type, and binding for a German publication, thick and closely printed withal, so that the lovers of long romances, who like to feel that they have before them hour after hour of quiet trotting in a pony-chaise, rather than the brain-congesting hurry of a railway journey, will find the Deutsche Bibliothek to their taste in this respect. "We no longer travel, we arrive at places,” says Thackeray, regretting the incident and variety of the old-fashioned journey; and perhaps there is the same sort of disadvantage in short tales, which are always bringing one to the shock or the terminus of a dénoucment.</p><p>BELLES LETTRES (WESTWARD HO! AND CONSTANCE HERBERT) (JULY 1855). </p><p>EVERY one who was so happy as to go mushrooming in his early days, remembers his delight when, after picking up and throwing away heaps of dubious fungi, dear to naturalists but abhorred of cooks, he pounces on an unmistakeable mushroom, with its delicate fragrance and pink lining tempting him to devour it there and then, to the prejudice of the promised dish for breakfast. We speak in parables, after the fashion of the wise, amongst whom Reviewers are always to be reckoned. The plentiful dubious fungi are the ordinary quarter s crop of novels, not all poisonous, but generally not appetizing, and certainly not nourishing; and the unmistakeable mushroom is a new novel by Charles Kingsley.1 It seemed too long since we had any of that genuine description of external nature, not done after the poet s or the novelist s recipe, but flowing from spontaneous observation and enjoyment any of that close, vigorous painting of out-door life, which serves as myrrh and rich spices to embalm much perishable theorizing and offensive objurgation too long since we had a taste of that exquisite lyrical inspiration to which we owe </p><p>"O, Mary! go and call the cattle home </p><p>Along the sands of Dec." </p><p>After courses of "psychological" novels (very excellent things in their way), where life seems made up of talking and journalizing, and men are judged almost entirely on "carpet consideration," we are ready to welcome a stirring historical romance, by a writer who, poet and scholar and social reformer as he is, evidently knows the points of a horse and has followed the hounds, who betrays a fancy for pigs, and becomes dithyrambic on the virtues of tobacco. After a surfeit of Hebes and Psyches, or Madonnas Magdalens, it is refreshment to turn Kiss's Amazon. But this ruddy and, now and then, rather ferocious barbarism, which singularly compounded in Mr. Kingsley with the susceptibility of the poet and the warm sympathy of the philanthropist, while it gives his writings one of their principal </p><p>1 ""Westward Ho! or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of Burrough, in the County of Devon, in the Reign of Her Most Glorious Majesty Queen Elizabeth." Rendered into Modern English by Charles Kingsley. Cambridge: Macmillan and Co. 1855. </p><p>charms, is also the source of their gravest fault. The battle and the chase seem necessary to his existence; and this Red Man s nature, planted in a pleasant rectory among corn fields and pastures, takes, in default of better game, to riding down capitalists and Jesuits, and fighting with that Protean pcrsonage "the devil." If, however, Mother Nature has made Mr. Kingsley very much of a poet and philanthropist, and a little of a savage, her dry-nurse Habit has made him superlativer a preacher: he drops into the homily as readily as if he had been "to the manner born;" and while by his artistic faculty he can transplant you into whatever scene he will, he can never trust to the impression that scene itself will make on you, but, true to his cloth, must always "improve the occasion." In these two points his fierce antagonism and his perpetual hortative tendency lie, to our thinking, the grand mistakes which enfeeble the effect of all Mr. Kingsley"s works, and are too likely to impede his production of what his high powers would otherwise promise a fiction which might be numbered among our classics. Poet and artist in a rare degree, his passionate impetuosity and theological prepossessions inexorably forbid that he should ever be a philosopher; he sees, feels, and paints vividly, but he theorizes illogically and moralizes absurdly. If he would con.ne himself to his true sphere, he might be a teacher in the sense in which every great artist is a teacher namely, by giving us his higher sensibility as a medium, a delicate acoustic or optical in strument, bringing home to our coarser senses What would otherwise be unperceived by us. But Mr. Kingsley, unhappily, like so many other gifted men, has two steeds his Pegasus and his hobby: the one he rides with a graceful abandon, to the admiration of all beholders; but no sooner does he get astride the other, than he becomes a feeble imitator of Carlyle s man ge, and attempts to put his wooden toy to all the wonderful paces of the great Scotchman s fiery Tartar horse. This imitation is probably not a conscious one, but arises simply from the fact, that Mr. Kingsley s impetuosity and Boanerges  vein give him an affinity for Carlyle s faults his one-sided judgment of character and his undiscriminating fulminations against the men of the present as tried by some imaginary standard in the past. Carlyle s great merits Mr. Kingsley's powers are not fitted to achieve; his genius lies in another direction. He has not that piercing insight which every now and then flashes to the depth of things, and alternating as it does with the most obstinate one-sidedness, makes Carlyle a wonderful paradox of wisdom and wilfulness; he has not that awful sense of the mystery of existence which continually checks and chastens the denunciations of the Teufelsdr ckh; still less has he the rich humour, the keen satire, and the tremendous word-missiles, which Carlyle hurls about as Milton s angels hurl the rocks. But Mr. Kingsley can scold; he can select one character for unmixed eulogy and another for unmitigated vituperation; he can undertake to depict a past age and try to make out that it was the pattern of all heroisms now utterly extinct; he can sneer at actual doings which are only a new form of the sentiments he vaunts as the peculiar possession of his pet period; he can call his own opinion God, and the opposite</p><p>[Vo. LXIV. No.CXXV.] NEW SERIES,Vol. VIII. No. I. U </p><p>opinion the Devil. Carlyle s love of the concrete makes him prefer any proper name rather than an abstraction, and we are accustomed to smile at this in him, knowing it to be mere Carlylian rhetoric; but with Mr. Kingsley, who has publicly made a vehement disclaimer of all heterodoxy, and wishes to he understood as believing "all the doctrines of the Catholic Church," we must interpret such phraseology more literally. But enough of general remarks. Let us turn to the particular work before us, where we shall find all the writer s merits and faults in full blow. We abstain on principle from telling the story of novels, which seems to us something like stealing geraniums from your friend s flower-pot to stick in your own button-hole: you spoil the effect of his plant, and you secure only a questionable ornament for yourself. We shall therefore be careful to give the reader no hint of the domestic story around which Mr. Kingsley has grouped the historical scenes and characters of "Westward Ho!" </p><p>Hardly any period could furnish a happier subject for an historical fiction than the one Mr. Kingsley has here chosen. It is unhackneyed, and it is unsurpassed in the grandeur of its moral elements, and the picturesqueness and romance of its manners and events. Mr. Kingsley has not brought only genius but much labour to its illustration. He has fed his strong imagination with all accessible material, and given care not only to the grand figures and incidents but to small details. One sees that he knows and loves his Devonshire at first hand, and he has evidently lingered over the description of the forests and savannahs and rivers of the New World, until they have become as vividly present to him as if they were part of his own experience. We dare not pronounce on the merit of his naval descriptions, but to us, landlubbers as we are, they seem wonderfully real, and not to smack at all of technicalities learned by rote over the desk. He has given a careful and loving study to the history and literature of the period, and whatever misrepresentation there is in the book, is clearly not due to ignorance but to prepossession: if he misrepresents, it is not because he has omitted to examine, but because he has examined through peculiar spectacles. In the construction of a story Mr. Kingsley has never been felicitous; and the feebleness of his d nouements have been matter of amazement, even to his admirers. In this respect, "Westward Ho!" though by no means criticism-proof, is rather an advance on his former works, especially in the winding-up. It is true, this winding-up reminds us a little of Jane Eyre, but we prefer a partially borrowed beauty to an original bathos, which was what Mr. Kingsley achieved in the later chapters of "Alton Locke" and "Yeast." Neither is humour his forte. His Jack Brimblecombe is too much like a piece of fun obligato, after the manner of Walter Scott, who remains the unequalled model of historical romancists, however they may criticize him. Mr. Kingsley s necessity for strong loves and strong hatreds, and his determination to hold up certain persons as models, is an obstacle to his successful delineation of character, in which he might otherwise excel. As it is, we can no more believe in and love his men and women than we could believe in and love the pattern-boy at school, always cited as a rebuke to our aberrations. Amyas Leigh would be a real, loveable fellow enough if he were a little less exemplary, and if Mr. Kingsley would not make him a text to preach from, as we suppose he is accustomed to do with Joshua, Gideon, and David. Until he shakes off this parsonic habit he will not be able to create truly human characters, or to write a genuine historical romance. Where his prepossessions do not come into play, where he is not dealing with his model heroes, or where the drama turns on a single passion or motive, he can scarcely be rivalled in truthfulness and beauty of presentation; for in clothing passion with action and language, and in the conception of all that gives local colouring, he has his best gifts to aid him. Beautiful is that episode of Mr. Oxenham s love, told by Salvation Yeo! Very admirable, too, is the felicity with which Mr. Kingsley has seized the style and spirit of the Elizabethan writers, and reproduced them in the poetry and supposed quotations scattered through his story. But above all other charms in his writings, at least to us, is his scene-painting. Who does not remember the scene by the wood in "Alton Locke," or that of the hunt at the beginning of "Yeast"? And "Westward Ho!" is wealthy in still greater beauties of the same kind. Here is a perfect gem. After a description of the old house at Stow, the residence of Sir Richard Grenvile, we read</p><p>"From the house on three sides, the hill sloped steeply down, and the garden where Sir Richard and Amyas were walking gave a truly English prospect. At one turn they could catch, over the western walls, a glim so of the blue ocean flecked with passing sails; and at the next, spread far he below them, range on range of fertile park, stately avenue, yellow autumn woodland, and purple heather moors, lapping over and over each other up the valley to the old British earthwork, which stood black and furze-grown on its conical peak; and standing out against the sky on the highest bank of hill which closed the valley to the east, the lofty tower ony Kilkhampton church, rich with the monuments and offerings of five centuries of Grenviles. A yellow eastern haze hung soft over park, and wood, and moor; the red cattle lowed to each other as they stood brushing away the flies in the rivulet far below; the colts in the horse-park close on their right whinnied as they played together, and their sires from the Queen s park, on the opposite hill, answered them in fuller though fainter voices. A rutting stag made the still woodland rattle with his hoarse thunder, and a rival far up the valley gave back a trumpet note of defiance, and was himself defied from heathery brows which quivered far away above, half seen through the veil of eastern mist. And close at home, upon the terrace before the house, amid romping spaniels and golden-haired children, sat Lady Grenvile herself, the beautiful St. Leger of Annery, the central jewel of all that glorious place, and looked down at noble children, and then at her more noble husband, and round at that broad paradise of the west, till life seemed too full of happiness, and heaven of light."</p><p>It pleasanter to linger over beauties such as these, than to point out faults; but unhappily, Mr. Kingsley s faults are likely to do harm in other ways than in subtracting from the lustre of his fame, and a faithful reviewer must lift up his voice against them, whether men "will hear, or whether they will forbear." Who that has any knowledge of our history and literature that has felt his heart beat high at the idea of great crises and great deeds that has any true recognition of the greatest poetry, and some of the greatest thoughts enshrined in our language, is not ready to pay the tribute of enthusiastic reverence to the Elizabethan age? In his glowing picture of that age, Mr. Kingsley would have carried with him all minds in which there is a spark of nobleness, if he could have freed himself from the spirit of the partisan, and been content to admit that in the Elizabethan age, as in every other, human beings, human parties, and human deeds are made up of the most subtly intermixed good and evil. The battle of Armageddon in which all the saints are to fight on one side, has never yet come. It is perfectly true that, at certain epochs, the relations and tendencies of ideas and events are so clearly made out to minds of any superiority, that the best and ablest men are for the most part ranged under one banner: there was a point at which it must have become disgraceful to a cultivated mind not to accept the Copernican system, and in these days we are unable to draw any favourable inference concerning the intellect or morals of a man who advocates capital punishment for sheep-stealing or forgery. But things have never come to this pass with regard to Catholicism and Protestantism; and even supposing they had, Mr. Kingsley's ethics seem to resemble too closely those of his bugbears the Dominicans, when he implies that it is a holy work for the "Ayes" to hunt down the" Noes" like so many beasts of prey. His view of history seems not essentially to differ from that we have all held in our childish days, when it seemed perfectly easy to us to divide mankind into the sheep and the goats, when we devoutly believed that our favourite heroes, Wallace and Bruce, and all who fought on their side, were " good," while Edward and his soldiers were all "wicked;" that all the champions of the Reformation were of unexceptionable private character, and all the adherents of Popery consciously vicious and base. Doubtless the Elizabethan age bore its peculiar fruit of excellence, as every age has done which forms a nodus, a ganglion, in the historical development of humanity as the age of Pericles produced the divinest sculptures, or the age of the Roman Republic the severe grandeur of Roman law and Roman patriotism, or as the core of the Middle Ages held the germ of chivalrous honour and reverential love. Doubtless the conquest of the Spanish Armada was virtually the triumph of light and freedom over darkness and bondage. What then? Is this a reason why Mr. Kingsley should seem almost angry with us for not believing with the men of that day in the golden city of Manoa and the Gulf-stream, or scold by anticipation any one who shall dare to congratulate himself on being undeceived in these matters? Doubtless Drake, Hawkins, Frobisher, and the rest, were brave, energetic men men of great will and in some sort of great faculty; but like all other human agents, they "builded better than they knew;" and it would be as rational to suppose that the bee is an entomological Euclid, interested only in the solution of a problem, as to suppose that the motives of these mariners were as grand as the results of their work. </p><p>We had marked several passages as specimens of the small success which attends Mr. Kingsley in his favourite exercise of deducing a moral, but our want of space obliges us to renounce the idea of quoting them, with the exception of one, which, we think, will in some degree justify our low estimate of Mr. Kingsley s gifts as a philosophizer. Here is the passage</p><p>"Humboldt has somewhere a curious passage; in which, looking on some wretched group of Indians, squatting stupidly round their fires, besmeared with grease an paint, and devouring ants and clay, he somewhat na vely remarks, that were it not for science, which teaches us that such is the crude material of humanity, and this the state from which we all have risen, he should have been tempted rather to look upon those hapless beings as the last degraded remnants of some fallen and dying race. One wishes that the great traveller had been bold enough to yield to that temptation, which his own reason and common sense presented to him as the real explanation of the sad sight, instead of following the dogmas of a so-called science, which has not a fact whereon to base its wild notion, and must ignore a thousand facts in asserting it. His own good sense, it seems, coincided instinctively with the Bible doctrine, that man in a state of nature is a fallen being, doomed to death a view which may be a sad one, but still one more honourable to poor humanit than the theory, that we all began as some sort of two-handed apes. It is surely more hopeful to believe that those poor Otomaes or Guahibas were not what they ought to be, than to behave that they were. It is certainly more complimentary to them, to think that they had been somewhat nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by, than that they were such blockheads as to have dragged on, the son after the father, for all the thousands of cars which have elapsed since man was made, without having had wit enough to discover any better food than ants and clay. </p><p>"Our voyagers, however, like those of their time, troubled their heads with no such questions. Taking the Bible story as they found it, they agreed with Humboldt s reason, and not with his science; or, to speak correctly, agreed with Humboldt s self, and not with the shallow anthropologic theories which happened to be in vogue fifty years ago; and their new hosts were in their eyes immortal souls like themselves, 'captivated by the devil at his will,' lost there in the pathless forests, likely to be lost hereafter." </p><p>Note the accuracy of Mr. Kingsley s reasoning. Humboldt observes that, but for scientific data leading to an opposite conclusion, he could have imagined that a certain group of Indians were the remnants of a race which had sunk from a state of well-being to one of almost helpless barbarism. Hereupon, Mr. Kingsley sorry that Humboldt did not reject "the dogmas of so-called science," and rest in this conception which "coincided with the Bible doctrine;" and he urges as one of his reasons for this regret, that would be complimentary to the Otomacs and Guahibas to suppose that in centuries gone by, they had been nobler and more prudent. Now, so far as we are acquainted with the third chapter of Genesis, and with the copious exegeses of that chapter from St. Paul downwards, the "Bible doctrine" is not that man multiplied on the earth and formed communities and nations amongst the rest, noble and prudent societies of Otomacs and Guahibas in a state of innocence, and that then came the Fall. We have always understood that for the Fall "we may thank Adam," and that consequently the first Otomac or Guahiba was already "captived by the devil," and "likely to be lost hereafter." Hence, what the question of the Otomacs and Guahibas having been nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by, can have to do with the doctrine of the Fall, we are at a loss to perceive. We will do no more than point to Mr. Kingsley s cool arrogance in asserting that a man like Humboldt, the patriarch of scientific investigators, is "misled bythe dogmas of a so-called science, which has not a fact whereon to base its wild notions." Indeed it is rather saddening to dwell on the occasional absurdities into which anomalous opinions can betray a man of real genius; and after all, the last word we have to say of "Westward Ho!" is to thank Mr. Kingsley for the great and beautiful feeling towards his works in general is that of high admiration. </p><p>Next in interest to "Westward Ho!" at least among the English novels of the quarter, is "Constance Herbert."2 Miss Jewsbury has created precedents for herself which make critics exacting towards her. We measure her work by her own standard, and find it deficient; when if measured by the standard of ordinary feminine novelists, it would perhaps seem excellent. We meet with some beauties it which, coming from the author of the "Half Sisters," we take as a matter of course, but we miss other beauties which she has taught us to expect; we feel that she is not equal to herself; and it is a tribute to her well-attested powers if we dwell on what has disappointed us, rather than on what has gratified us. An easy, agreeable style of narrative, some noble sentiments expressed in the quiet, unexaggerated way that indicates their source to be a deep spring of conviction and experience, not a mere rain-torrent of hearsay enthusiasm, with here and there a trait of character or conduct painted with the truthfulness of close observation, are merits enough to raise a book far above the common observation, are merits enough to raise a book far above the common run of circulating library fiction; but they are not enough to make a good novel, or one worthy of Miss Jewsbury s reputation. "Constance Herbert" is a Tendenz-roman; the characters and incidents are selected with a view to the enforcement of a principle. The general principle to be enforced is the unhesitating, uncompromising sacrifice inclination to duty, and the special case to which this principle is applied in the novel, is the abstinence from marriage where there is an inheritance of insanity. So far, we have no difference of opinion with Miss Jewsbury. But the mode in which she enforces the principle, both theoretically in the Envoi and illustratively in the story of her novel, implies, we think, a false view of life, and virtually nullifies the very magnanimity she inculcates. "If," she says in the Envoi, "we have succeeded in articulating any principle in this book, it is to entreat our readers to have boldness to act up to the sternest requirements that duty claims as right. Although it may at the time seem to slay them, will in the end prove life. Nothing they renounce for the sake of a higher principle, will prove to have been worth the keeping." The italics are ours, and we use them to indicate what we think false in Miss Jewsbury's moral. This moral is illustrated in the novel by the story of three ladies, who, after renouncing their lovers, or being renounced by them, have the satisfaction of feeling in the end that </p><p>2 "Constance Herbert." By Geraldine E. Jewsbury. London: Hurst and Blackett. </p><p>these lovers were extremely "good-for-nothing," and that they (the ladies) have had an excellent riddance. In all this we can see neither the true doctrine of renunciation, nor a true representation of the realities of life; and we are sorry that a writer of Miss Jewsbury s insight and sincerity should have produced three volumes for the sake of teaching such copy-book morality. It is not the fact that what duty calls on us to renounce, will invariably prove "not worth the keeping;" and if it were the fact, renunciation would cease to be moral heroism, and would be simply a calculation of prudence. Let us take the special case which Miss Jewsbury has chosen as her illustration. It might equally happen that a woman in the position of Constance Herbert, who renounces marriage because she will not entail on others the family heritage of insanity, had fixed her affections, not on an egotistic, shallow worldling like Philip Marchmont, but on a man who was fitted to make the happiness of a woman s life, and whose subsequent career would only impress on her more and more deeply the extent of the sacrifice she had made in refusing him. And it is this very perception that the thing we renounce is precious, is something never to be compensated to us, which constitutes the beauty and heroism of renunciation. The only motive that renders such a resolution as Constance Herbert s noble, is that keen sympathy with human misery which makes a woman prefer to suffer for the term of her own life, rather than run the risk of causing misery to an indefinite number of other human beings; and a mind influenced by such a motive will find no support in the very questionable satisfaction of discovering that objects once cherished were in fact worthless. The notion that duty looks stern, but all the while has her hand full of sugar-plums, with which she will reward us by-and-by, is the favourite cant of optimists, who try to make out that this tangled wilderness of life has a plan as easy to trace as that of a Dutch garden; but it really undermines all true moral development by perpetually substituting something extrinsic as a motive to action, instead of the immediate impulse of love or justice, which alone makes an action truly moral. This is a grave question to enter on  propos of a novel; but Miss Jewsbury is so emphatic in the enunciation of her moral, that she forces us to consider her book rather in the light of a homily than of a fiction to criticise her doctrine rather than her story. On another point, too, we must remonstrate with her a little, chiefly because we value her influence, and should like to see it always in what seems to us the right scale. With the exception of Mr. Harrop, who is simply a cipher awaiting a wife to give him any value, there is not a man in her book who is not either weak, perfidious, or rascally, while almost all the women are models of magnanimity and devotedness. The lions, i.e., the ladies, have got the brush in their hands with a vengeance now, and are retaliating for the calumnies of men from Adam downwards. Perhaps it is but fair to allow them a little exaggeration. Still we must meekly suggest that we cannot accept an ex parte statement, even from that paragon Aunt Margaret, as altogether decisive. Aunt Margaret tells us that in the bloom of youth and beauty, with virtues and accomplishments to correspond, she alienated her husband by pure devotion to him. "No man," she says, "can bear entire devotion." This reminds us of a certain toper, who after drinking a series of glasses of brandy-and-water one night, complained the next morning that the water did not agree with him. We are inclined to think that it is less frequently devotion which alienates men, than something infused in the devotion a certain amount of silliness, or temper, or exigeance, for example, which, though given in small doses, will, if persevered in, have a strongly alterative effect. Men, in fact, are in rather a difficult position: in one ear a Miss Grace Lee, or some such strong-minded woman, thunders that they demand to be worshipped, and abhor a woman who has any self-dependence; on the other, a melancholy Viola complains that they never appreciate devotion, that they care only for a woman who treats them with indifierence. A discouraging view of the case for both sexes! Seriously, we care too much for the attainment of a better understanding as to woman s true position, not to be sorry when a writer like Miss Jewsbury only adds her voice to swell the confusion on this subject.</p><p>"The merits of Thorney Hall"3 are of the negative kind. It is not sentimental, not inflated, not religio-didactic: it has no pretension to be anything else than a story of ordinary life, with its inward and outward trials, its mistakes and misfortunes. But this one pretension it fails to make good; its scenes and characters are vague and shadowy; they neither remind us of our own experience nor make us believe in them as the experience of another. However, those who are looking out for a one-volumed novel, which will not disturb the initiation of the digestive process, and is likely, by-and-by, to lull them into their siesta, will find Thorney Hall" unexceptionable for their purpose. </p><p>"Our World; or, the Democrat s Rule,"4 is an American novel which will attract only those readers who can be induced to linger over scenes more painful than the most painful in "Uncle Tom s Cabin," by any slighter motive than a stern necessity for becoming acquainted with the facts of a special case. Compared with the perverted feeling shown in the choice of such subjects, we can tolerate the milk-and-water triviality of "Married Women."5 We suppose there is still a public for novels like this among the clients of the circulating libraries in provincial towns; and, after all, an interest in such feeble creations is better than blank ennui or indulgence in acrid gossip. After this home-made gooseberry, it is curious totaste the fine old crusted port (not without bee s wing) of Cervantes' "Exemplary Novels,"6 which Mr. Bohn gives us in one of his extra volumes, or the "double stout" of De Fee s works,7 of which a new volume, containing "Roxana,"</p><p>3 "Thorney Hall: a Story of an Old Family."

A very pretty theatre it is, and all its appointments show that the Grand Duke does not grudge expense for tho sake of keeping up its traditional reputation. The operahere, as every one knows, has two special attractions : it is superintended by Liszt; and Wagner's operas, in many places consigned to the Index Expurgatorius of mana gers, are a standing part of the Weimar repertoire. Most London concert-goers, for whom Liszt has 'blazed the comet of a season,' think of him as certainly the archimagus of pianists, but as otherwise a man of no particular significance; as merely an erratic, flighty, artistic genius, who has swept through Europe, the Napoleon of the talon, carrying devastation into the hearts of countesses. A single morning's interview with him is enough to show the falsity of this conception. In him Nature has not sacrificed the man to the artist; rather, as the blossom of the acacia is a glorious ornament to the tree, but we see it fall without regret because the tree itself is grand and beautiful, so if Liszt the pianist were unknown to you, or even did not exist, Liszt the man would win your admiration and love. See him for a few hours and you will be charmed by the originality of his conversation and the brilliancy of his wit; know him for weeks or months, and you will discern in him a man of various thought, of serious purpose, and of a moral nature which, in its mingled strength and gentleness, has the benignest influence on those about him. </p><p>The lovers of characteristic heads could hardly have a more interesting study than the head of Liszt. No wonder Ary Scheffer is fond of painting him, and that the type of Liszt's face seems to haunt this artist in so many of his compositions. I never saw features having at once so strong and clear an outline and so rich a gamut of expression; at one moment you think what a capital [?] for a witch in Macbeth, in the party, brow and preternatural grey light in his eyes; at another, with head thrown back and nostril dilated, he suggests a prophet in the moment of inspiration: and then again, seated placidly silent amidst a group of gay talkers, he is a perfect model of a St. John. Scheffer has seized something of the second expression in a picture in which he expressly intended to introduce an idealization of Liszt. The picture represents the three Magi, two of whom are venerable bearded sages watching with bent head the third a young man in the likeness of Liszt who is gazing in ecstasy at the guiding light above them. In Liszt, of course, there is baser metal mingled with the fine gold; and besides this natural alloy, there is the tarnish contracted in a life spent in the midst of adulation. Even an ordinary man has to pass through so many 'mud baths' before he reaches his fortieth year, and some of the mud will become ingrained in the process. But, take him all in all, he is a glorious creature one of those men whom the ancients would have imagined the son of a god or goddess, from their superiority to the common clay of humanity. </p><p>It seems to be understood that we may write the more freely of our personal admiration for musical and dramatic artists, because their fame does not live after them, except for a few short years in the eulogies of their superannuated contemporaries, who are listened to with an incredulous smile as laudatores lemporis acti. It is this fact which gives a character of justice to the apparently excessive tribute of adoration paid to a great actor, a great singer, or a great instrumentalist; they have but their 'one crowded hour of glorious life,' while the genius who can leave permanent creations behind him knows that he shall live for the next ago more emphatically than for his own an ideal life, if you will, but happily one which is felt to be more real by many a noble soul than the pudding and praise of the present hour. Fame is but another word for the sympathy of mankind with individual genius, and the great poet or the great composer is sure that that sympathy will be given some day, though his Paradise Lost will fetch only five pounds, and his symphony is received with contemptuous laughter, so he can transport himself from the present and live by anticipation in that future time when he will be thrilling men's minds and ravishing their ears. But the artist whose genius can only act through his physical presence has not this reversionary life; the memory of the prima donna scarcely outlives the flowers that are flung at her feet on her farewell night, and even the fame of a Garrick or a Siddons is simply a cold acquiescence in the verdict of the past. It is possible, however, that Liszt will turn out to be something more than one of those coruscating meteors, who come, are seen, and are extinguished in darkness; he is now devoting himself principally to composition, and may perhaps produce something perennial, though the opponents of the Wagner sect, of which Liszt is the great apostle, will not believe that any good can come out of Nazareth.</p><p>Liszt, indeed, has devoted himself with the enthusiasm of earnest con viction to the propaganda of Wagnerism: he has not only used his personal influence to get Wagner's operas put on the stage, but he has also founded a musical newspaper(Neue Zeittchriflfiir Musik), which is the organ of the Romantic School in music, and derives its chief value from the contributions of his pen. Much cheap ridicule has been spent on the 'music of the future;' a ridicule excused, perhaps, by the more than ordinary share Herr Wagner seems to have of a quality which is common to almost all innovators and heretics, and which their converts baptize as profound conviction, while the adherents of the old faith brand it as arrogance. It might be well, however, if the ridicule were arrested by the consideration that there never was an innovating movement which had not some negative value as a criticism of the prescriptive, if not any positive value as a lasting creation. The attempt at an innovation reveals a want that has not hitherto been met, and if the productions of the innovator are exaggerated symbols of the want, rather than symmetrical creations which have within them the conditions, of permanence like an Owenite parallelogram, an early poem of Wordsworth's, or an early picture of Overbeck's still they are protests which it is wiser to accept as strictures than to hiss down as absurdities. Without pretending to be a musical critic, one may be allowed to give an opinion as a person with an ear and a mind susceptible to the direct and indirect influences of music. In this character I may say that, though unable to recognise Herr Wagner's compositions as the ideal of the opera, and though, with a few slight exceptions, not deeply affected by his music on a first nearing, it is difficult to me to understand how any one who finds deficiencies in the opera as it has existed hitherto, can give fair attention to Wagner's theory, and his exemplification of it in his operas, without admitting that he has pointed out the direction in which the lyric drama must develope itself, if it is to be developed at all. Moreover, the musician who writes librettos for himself, which can be read with interest as dramatic poems, must be a man of no ordinary mind and accomplishments, and such a man, even when he errs, errs with ingenuity, so that his mistakes are worth studying. </p><p>Wagner would make the opera a perfect musical drama, in which feelings and situations spring out of character, as in the highest order of tragedy, and in which no dramatic probability or poetic beauty is sacrificed to musical effect. The drama must not be a mere pretext for the music; but music, drama, and spectacle must be blended, like the coloured rays in the sunbeam, so as to produce one undivided impression. The controversy between him and his critics is the old controversy between Gluck and Piccini, between the declamatory and melodic schools of music, with the same difference in comprehensiveness as between the disputes of La Motte and the Daciers about the value of the classics, and the disputes of the classical and romantic schools of literature in our own day. In its first period the opera aimed simply at the expression of feeling through melody ; the second period, which has its culmination in the joint productions of Meyerbeer and Scribe, added the search for effective situations and a heightening of dramatic movement, which has led more and more to the predominance of the declamatory style and the subordination of melody. But in Meyerbeer's operas the grand object is to produce a climax of spectacle, situation, and orchestral effects; there is not attempt at the evolution of these from the true workings of human character and human passions; on the contrary, the characters seem to be a second thought, and with a few exceptions, such as Alice and Marcel, are vague and uninteresting. Every opera-goer has remarked that Robert is a mere nose of wax; or has laughed at the pathos with which the fiend Bertram invites his son to go to the bottomless pit with him, instead of settling into respectability above ground; or has felt that Jean, the Prophet, is a feeble sketch, completely lost in the blaze of spectacle. Yet what a progress is there in the libretto of these operas compared with the libretto of Der Freisch tz, which, nevertheless, was thought so good in its day that Goethe said Weber ought to divide the merit of success with Kind. Even Weber's enchanting magic cannot overcome the sense of absurdity when, in a drinking party of two, one of whom is sunk in melancholy, a man gets up and bursts into a rolling song which seems the very topmost wave in the high tide of becchanalian lyrism; or when Caspar climbs a tree apparently for no other reason than because the d nouement requires him to be shot.</p><p>Now, says Wagner, this ascent from the warbling puppets of the early opera to dramatic effects of Meyerbeer, only serves to bring more clearly into view teh unattained summit of the true musical drama. An opera must be no mosaic of melodies stuck together with no other method than is supplied by accidental contrast, no mere succession of ill-prepared crises, but an organic whole, which grows up like a palm, its earliest portion containing the germ and prevision of all the rest. He will write no part to suit a primo tenore, and interpolate no cantata to show off the powers of a primadonna assolata; those who sing his operas must be content with the degree of prominence which falls to them in strict consonance with true dramatic development and ordonnance. Such, so far as I understand it, is Wagner's theory of the opera surely a theoty worth entertaining, and one which he has admirably exemplified so far as the libretto of his operas is concerned. </p><p>But it is difficult to see why this theory should entail the exclusion of melody to the degree at which he has arrived in Lohengrin, unless we accept one of two suppositions: either that Wagner is deficient in melodic inspiration, or that his inspiration has been overridden by his system, which opposition has pushed to exaggeration. Certainly his Fliegender Holl nder a translation work, in which, as Liszt says, he only seeks to escape from the idols to which he has hitherto sacrificed, and has not yet reached the point of making war against them is a charming opera; and Tannh user too is still the music of men and women, as well as of Wagnerities; but Lohengrin to us ordinary mortals seemed something like the whistling of the wind through the keyholes of a cathedral, which has a dreamy charm for a little while, but by and bye you long for the sound even of a street organ to rush in and break the monotony. It may be safely said, that whatever the music of the future may be, it will not be a music which is in contradiction with a permanent elelment in human nature the need for a frequent alternation of sensations or emotions; and this need is not satisfied in Lohen grin. </p><p>As to melody who knows? It is just possible that melody, as we conceive it, is only a transitory phase of music, and that the musicians of the future may read the airs of Mozart and Beethoven and Rossini as scholars read the Stabreim and assonance of early poetry. We are but in 'the morning of the times,' and must learn to think of ourselves as tadpoles unprescient of the future frog. Still the tadpole is limited to tadpole pleasures; and so, in our state of development, we are swayed by melody. When, a little while after hearing Lohengrin, we happened to come on a party of musicians who were playing exquisitely a quartette of Beethoven's, it was like returning to the pregnant speech of men after a sojourn among glums and gowries. </p><p>This is a purely individual impression, produced even in spite of favourable prepossessions derived from hearing the Fliegender Holl nder and Tannh user, and only accidentally in agreement with the judgment of anti-Wagner critics, who are certainly in the majority at present. Still, those who are familiar with the history of music during the last forty or fifty years, should be aware that the reception of new music by the majority of musical critics, is not at all a criterion of its ultimate success. A man of high standing, both as a composer and executant, told a friend of mine, that when a symphony of Beethoven's was first played at the Philharmonic, there was a general titter among the musicians in the orchestra, of whom he was one, at the idea of sitting seri ously to execute such music! And as a proof that professed musicians are sometimes equally unfortunate in their predictions about music which begins by winning the ear of the public, he candidly avowed that when Rossini's music was first fascinating the world of opera-goers, he had joined in pronouncing it a mere passing fashion, that tickled only by its novelty. Not indeed that the contempt of musicians and the lash of critics is a pledge of future triumph: St. Paul five times received forty stripes save one, but so did many a malefactor; and unsuccessful composers before they take consolation from the pooh-poohing or 'damnation' of good music, must remember how much bad music has had the same fate, from the time when Jean Jacques' oratorio set the teeth of all hearers on edge. </p><p>If it were admissible for a person entirely without technical qualifications for judgment, to give an opinion on Wagner as a musician, I should say that his musical inspiration is not sufficiently predominant over his thinking and poetical power, for him to have the highest creative genius in music. So far as music is an art, one would think that the same rule applied to musicians as to other artists. Now, the greatest painters and sculptors have surely not been those who have been inspired through their intellect, who have first thought and then chosen a plastic symbol for their thought; rather, the symbol rushes in on their imagination before their slower reflection has seized any abstract idea embodied in it. Nay, perhaps the artist himself never seizes that idea, but his picture or his statue stands there an immortal symbol neverthe less. So the highest degree of musical inspiration must overmaster all other conceptions in the mind of the musical genius; and music will be great and ultimately triumphant over men's ears and souls in proportion as it is less a studied than an involuntary symbol. Of course in composing an oratorio or an opera, there is a prior conception of a theme; but while the composer in whom other mental elements outweigh his musical power will be preoccupied with the idea, the meaning he has to convey, the composer who is pre-eminently a musical genius, on the slightest hint of a passion or an action, will have all other modes of conception merged in the creation of music, which is for him the supreme language, the highest order of representation. All this may be wrong, and so may be my conjecture that Wagner is a composer of the reflective kind. We often enough mistake our own negations for a negation out of ourselves, as purblind people are apt to think the sun gives but a feeble light. </p><p>Certainly Wagner has admirably fulfilled his own requisition of organic unity in the opera. In his operas there is a gradual unfolding and elaboration of that fundamental contrast of emotions, that collision of forces, which is the germ of the tragedy; just as the leaf of the plant is successively elaborated into branching stem and compact bud and radiant corolla. The artifice, however,</p><p>of making certain contrasted strains of melody run like coloured threads through the woof of an opera, and also the other dramatic device of using a particular melody or musical phrase as a sort of Ahnung or prognostication of the approach or action of a particular character, are not altogether peculiar to Wagner, though he lays especial stress on them as his own. No one can forget the recurring hymn of Marcel in the Huguenots, or the strain of the Anabaptists in the Proph te, which is continually contrasted with the joyous song or dance of the rustics. Wagner, however, has carried out these devices much more completely, and, in the Fliegender Holl nder and Tannh user, with very impressive effect. With all my inability at present to enjoy his music as I have enjoyed that of Mozart, or Beethoven, or Mendelssohn, these two operas left in me a real desire to hear them again. </p><p>Wagner has wisely gone for the themes of his operas to the fresh and abundant source of early German poetry and legend, and the mode in which he expands and works up these themes shows a deep and refined poetic feeling. He was led to choose the story of the Flieqender Holl nder familiar to English ears as the 'Flying Dutchman' by happening to read Heine's beautiful version of the legend on a sea voyage, when a storm occurred and gave vividness to his conception of the doomed mariner's fate. The legend tells how, long, long ago, a Dutch vessel, making for the Cape of Good Hope, was encountered by an obstinate storm; how, when the sailors entreated the captain to put back, he exclaimed, 'Not if I must live on the sea to all eternity!' and how, as a punishment for this blasphemy, he was condemned to wander about the ocean until the last day, and bring destruction to all ships which met him on their way. The angel of mercy, however, announced to him that he should be permitted to go on shore every seven years and marry: if the wife he chose proved untrue to him, she too would be come the prey of the Evil One; but if he found a wife who would love him till death, her truth would expiate his guilt, and would open to him the gates of salvation. It is Heine's version of this legend which Wagner has expanded into a beautiful drama. </p><p>The first scene represents the rocky coast of Norway. It is night,a nd the sea is violent. A merchant ship is struggling with the storm, but at length manages to cast anchor. Daland, the captain, comes ashore to reconnoitre, and finds that the storm has thrown him seven miles from the accustomed haven, whither he was returning after a long absence. As the wind begins to be laid, he and his men go to rest, leaving a young pilot as a watch. The pilot tries to keep himself awake by singing a song to the south wind; but presently sleep conquers him so completely that he is undisturbed by the reawakening of the storm, through which glides in doomed safety, accompanied by mournful, mysterious music, the Hollander's black ship, with its red sails and ghastly crew. As the Hollander slowly descends to land, a strain that rises from the orchestra sounds like a sentence of doom, and recurs throughout the opera whenever his terrible fate is immediately operative. Leaning against a rock, the pale man soliloquizes on this new crisis in his destiny. Meanwhile morning breaks and rouses Daland, who, seeing the newly-arrived ship, hails it through the speaking-trumpet; but, to his amazement, receives no answer. Descrying the Hollander, he goes up to him, and asks him whence he comes. Then follows a scene in which the Hollander tells that he is a weary wanderer, and that he carries in his ship treasures from all climes, which he is ready to offer Daland if he will give him a home for a short time beneath his roof. Chests of precious things are brought from the ship; and the cupidity of Daland is so strongly excited, that when the Hollander asks to have his daughter as a wife, he persuades himself, with ready sophistry, that he is consulting his daughter's interest in consenting, and that the Hollander's openhandedness is a sign that he has a good heart. The storm is now allayed, and the ships weigh anchor. Dalaad's ship leads the way amid the joyous song of the sailors, and after it glides in dread silence the black ship with red sails.</p><p>The scene of the second act is a room in Daland's house, where his daughter Senta is sitting in dreamy sadness, gazing at a portrait of the unhappy Hollander which hangs on the wall; while round her a company of sprightly Norwegian maidens, presided over by Senta's nurse, are seated at their wheels, which mark the time of a charming song sung by them in chorus. The nurse becomes uneasy at Senta's rapt silence, and chides her for dwelling continually on this picture. The maidens join in her complaint, and jokingly tell Senta that her lover Eric will be jealous. Senta, disturbed in her reverie, asks the nurse to sing her the ballad about the Dutch captain; and when the nurse refuses, telling her to let the Dutch captain alone, she herself sings the wild and thrilling ballad; and by and bye, her companions, carried away by sympathy, join in the melancholy refrain. Exhausted byher emotion, she sinks fainting into her chair, while the maidens in voluntarily sing pianissimo the conclusion of the ballad, asking where the 'pale man' will find tho woman who will save him by her truth. Suddenly Senta rises, and singingin piercing tones, 'I am she!' </p><p>Ich sei's die Dich durch ihre Treu erls e! </p><p>M g Gottes Engel mich Dir zeigen: </p><p>Durch mich sollst Du das Hail erreichen! </p><p>she rushes with outstretched arms to the picture. While all are trembling at this outburst, Eric enters, and announces the arrival of Senta's father, with his ship; the maidens rush out to greet their lovers and relatives, and Senta is left alone with Eric, who tenderly urges her to ask her father's sanction for their speedy marriage. Unsatisfied by her answers, he accuses her of dwelling on the image of the legendary captain, and when these reproaches only call out stronger evidence of Senta's absorption in this ideal being, he exclaims that Satan has ensnared her, and that he has been admonished of this in a dream. Senta sinks into her chair, eager to hear the dream, but exhausted by her emotions, and during Eric's narration, seems </p><p>gradually to enter into a state of clairvoyance, in which the objects he describes as having appeared to him in a dream are actually presentto her inward vision the approach of the dark ship, the entrance of her father into their dwelling with the pale man, whom she runs to meet, and who passionately embraces her. 'And then,' continues Eric, 'I saw you flee away on the sea.' At these words Senta, her cheek pale, and her eyes fixed, exclaims, 'I must be lost with him!' </p><p>Er sucht mich auf, ich muss ihn sehn, </p><p>Mit ihm muss ich zu grunde gehn! </p><p>Eric, horror-struck at what he believes to be madness, rushes out. Senta turns again towards the portrait with affectionate gestures, as if it were a living being. While she is sunk in contemplation the door opens, and the pale man stands within its frame like a Vandyek picture. At this sight Senta gives a cry, but fixes her eye steadily on the apparition, as if gathering up her resolution to follow it till death. The Hollander returns her gaze with equal fixedness, and slowly advances into the room. Daland follows, puzzled at his daughter's astonishment, and asking her why she does not come to meet him. She embraces her father without turning away her eyes from the countenance of the stranger. In reply to her question, Daland tells her that the stranger possesses immense riches, that he is a banished wanderer, and hopes to find a new home with them. In a charming aria he exhorts her to receive the stranger well, and at length tells her that he has promised him her hand. Senta accepts this information with a melancholy gesture of acquiescence, and will not even turn her head to look at the casket of jewels which her father shows as a proof that he has consulted her welfare. At length </p><p>Daland leaves them to make acquaintance with each other. They break silence by speaking apart of their amazement at the sudden realization of a long presentiment. At last the Hollander approaches Senta, and asks her if she will fulfil</p><p>her father's promise. She replies, without revealing her knowledge of his secret, that whoever he may be, and whatever may be her lot in accepting him, she will her father. The unhappy man kneels at her feet, adoring her as a messenger from heaven, and they join in a duet of yearning desire that Senta may be the being who will bring him release. Then, with a movement of pride and generosity, unwilling to allow this self-sacrifice for his sake, the Hollander rises, and pointing out to Senta the sad lot to which she would unite herself in the bloom of youth, seeks to deter whether her from such an of devotion. But Senta answers, that she knows woman's sacred duties, and will be true till death. </p><p>Wohl kenn ich Weibes heil'ge Pflichten, </p><p>Sei d'rum getrost, unsel'ger Mann! </p><p>Lass'  ber Die das Schicksal richten</p><p>Die seinem Spruche trotzen kann! </p><p>Kenn' ich der Treue Hochgebot: </p><p>Wem ich sie weih', schenk ich die Eine, </p><p>	Die Treue bis zum Tod!</p><p>Exquisitely beautiful is Senta's declamation of these verses. The Hollander seems to drink hope and new life from her words, and both join in a glorious duet of triumphant love and confidence. </p><p>The third act opens with a sailors' festival. The scene is the haven where two ships lie at anchor. Daland's ship is decked with streamers, garlands, and lamps, and crew are feasting and dancing; the mysterious ship meanwhile remaining in darkness and silence. Presently women come with fresh provisions, and the sailors playfully attempt to get possession of the baskets, but the women will now allow this, wishing to reserve some for the sailors of the rich bridegroom. Seeing none of these among the merry-makers, they go to the edge of the quay and call to the Dutch ship. The deck is empty, and no sign is made in answer. The women repeat their call again and again, the sailors joining in with jeers and laughter, but the same deathlike stillness continuing reign in the mysterious ship, they begin to be alarmed, and hurry from the quay, trying to drown their terrors in new gaiety. When the women have left the scene, the fun becomes more riotous, and the sailors take up thair original joyous song. In the moment when the bacchanalian shout of the refrain  Hussassahc! Johollohe! is at its height, there floats on the Dutch ship a bluish flame, the crew suddenly rise out of the darkness, and, assembled  round the masts, fill the air with a  demoniacal chorus. At first Daland's crew are too much deafened by their own song to perceive this  outburst of satanic harmony this  terrific response to their gay refrain; but by and bye they become</p><p>aware of it, and ask each other whether it may not be a delusion of their wine-heated brains, or the work of evil spirits. To banish their fears, they continue their song, pitching it higher and higher, but are each time interrupted by the hellish Huissa! Johohoe! Joltohoe! till at length they are reduced to complete silence by a tremendous fortissimo. The pale, white-bearded phantoms continue their unearthly chorus, until the swelling flood of torrent diabolical song bursts into a torrent of still more diabolical laughter. The Norwegians cross themselves and rush from the spot in a panic. The whole scene is wonderfully effective, and the climax of the hellish chorus and hideous laughter is, I should think, not surpassed its kind. In the stillness that succeeds, Senta appears, already attired in the pretty dress of the Norwegian bride. She is pursued by the importunities of Eric, who is visiting her with tender reproaches. The Hollander approaches and over  hears him. In vain Senta tries to end the dialogue; Eric reminds her of all the tokens of kindness she has given him, tokens which he has interpreted as promises. Thus the Hollander learns that Senta has already loved, and thinks that she will perhaps one day regret the loss of this peaceful love, and repent her self-sacrifice, that she will at last forget her plighted truth, break her oath, and so fall to perdition. He loves her too well to expose her this danger; he hastens to her, takes leave of her, and rushingtowards his ship, calls to his sailors, 'To sea! To sea! for ever! all is over thy truth and my salvation!' Senta rushes after him, holds him by the arm, and reproaches him for so lightly doubting her truth. Then the Hollander tells her the doom</p><p>she would incur bybeing faithless to him, and that he is determined to renounce the hope of salvation, so that at all events she may be saved. In vain Senta assures him that she knows him, and the duties she has sworn to fulfil that she will save him. He tells her she does not know him, and exclaiming that he is the Flying Hollander,  </p><p>Der Fliegender Holl nder nennt man mirch! </p><p>he breaks loose from her, springs on board and pushes off from land. Senta struggles out of the hands of her friends, whom Eric has summoned in his alarm, and, springing to the edge of a jutting rock, calls to the Hollander, to behold that she is true till death, and throws herself into the sea. In the same moment the Hollander's ship sinks into the waves, and presently the forms of Senta and her rescued lover are seen hovering above the waters in light and glory.* </p><p>In Tannh user the dramatic situations are more striking than in the Fliegender Holl nder; indeed, I never saw an opera which had a more interesting succession of well-contrasted effects. The libretto is founded on the old German saga of the Venusberg and the knightly minstrel Tannh user. On the introduction of Christianity into Germany, the clergy, finding it impossible to eradicate from the minds of the people the faith in their old gods, resorted to the plan of representing them as demons, and transforming the benign influences formerly attributed to them into malignant ones. Thus Holda, the genial goddess, whose yearly procession through the land made the meadows flourish, was thrust down into subterranean caverns, and her appearance above ground was represented as unpropitious. Later, by a not uncommon blending of names and ideas, Holda was merged in a Germanized conception of Venus, and she was made the symbol of seductive sensuality. Her chief dwelling was supposed to be in Th ringia, in the interior of the H rselberg, near Eisenach, thence called the Venusberg. Here she held open court in a fairy palace, surrounded by her nymphs, naiads, and syrens, whose song was heard in the distance, and seduced mortals, who were the prey of impure desires, along unknown paths, to this grotto, where hell lay concealed under ensnaring ravishments, enticing them to everlasting destruction. Tannh user, the knight and minstrel, had, in one of the contests for the palm in song, won a brilliant victory, and with it the heart of the Princess Elizabeth of Th ringia. A short time after this he disappears, and no one can explain his absence. It is after the lapse of a year from this disappearance that the opera is supposed to commence. The curtain is drawn up on the interior of the Venusberg, with its nymphs and syrens dancing in rosy twilight, Venus lying on her couch, and Tannh user at her feet, with his harp in his hand. He has become weary of hectic sensualism, and tells her that he longs once more for the free air of the field and forest under the blue arch of heaven:  </p><p>Sterblich, ach! bin ich geblieben, </p><p>Und  bergross ist mir dein Lieben;</p><p>Wenn stets ein Gott geniessen kann, </p><p>Bin ich dein Wechsel unterthan; </p><p>Nicht Lust allein liegt mir am Herzen, </p><p>Aus Freuden sehn 'ich mich nach </p><p>schmerzen! </p><p>Venus starts up enraged, and reminds him with bitter sarcasm that he is accursed through his residence with her, and that the world he desires to return to would reject him with horror. Then she attempts to lull his awakened conscience by blandishments; but he breaks loose at once from her threats and her fascinations, by an appeal to the Virgin, on whom his salvation depends. At the mention of this sacred name the whole scene of enchantment vanishes. Instead of the grotto we see the landscape</p><p> My recollection of Wagner's three greatest operas has been assisted by Liszt's charming analysis or rather paraphrase of them that of the Fliegender Hollander, contained in five numbers of the Neue Zeitschrift f r Musik, and that of Tannh user and Lohengrin, in his little work entitled, Richard Wagner's Lohen grin unci Tannh user.</p><p>round the Wartburg in the pure air of a spring morning. To the deafening sounds of the preceding scene follows a complete silence of the orchestra, and the soft, dreamy song of a shepherd seated on a neigh bouring rook. Before Tannh user is awakened to complete consciousness of his deliverance, we hear in the distance the chorus of a band of pilgrims. In the pauses of their song the voice of the shepherd who recommends himself to their prayers forms a fresh contrast. The pilgrims approach, and pause before an image of the Virgin. Tannh user on hearing their song throws himself on his knees, and overwhelmed with gratitude for the mercy which has rescued him, repeats the penitent words of the pilgrims. The bells of the neighbouring church call believers to morning prayer, and at the same time the signals of a hunting horn heard, at various distances, heighten the impression of rural peace and sylvan loneliness. Soon after arrives the Landgrave with his hunt, and perceiving a knight who seems to be standing apart from the train of courtiers, approaches him, and recognises Tannh user. Wolfram von Eschenbach, Tannh user's rival in the poetic art, and also in love for the Princess Elizabeth, at last by speaking of her prevails on Tannh user to take his old place among the minstrels, whom he had so often conquered, and who never theless mourned his absence. The name of Elizabeth is like a sunbeam to Tannh user, and he breaks into a song of joy, ending 'To her! To her!' As soon as his voice unites with the others, the septett commences a joyous allegro, the finale of which, interrupted by the sound of the hunting horn, forms the close of the first act. </p><p>The second act opens with the meeting between Elizabeth and Tannh user, generously brought about by Wolfram, and we have a duet of happy greeting. Elizabeth is dressed for the festival, which is about to commence the contest of minstrels. During the entrance of the Landgrave and his guests, a fine march is played by the orchestra. A second march in another key accompanies the entrance of the minstrels. As soon as the guests have ranged themselves and the minstrels have entered, there is a deep silence. Wolfram rises first, his name having been drawn from the urn by Elizabeth. Like all the other minstrels he carries his harp in his hand, and the songs are all accompanied by this instrument in the orchestra. He sings in praise of spiritual love. Tannh user replies, intimating that true love demands something more than mere contemplation. Walther von der Vogelweide then rises, and admonishes Tannh user that his idea of love is too sensuous. Tannh user starts up, aud sings again in ardent vindication of his former strain that distant worship belongs to the stars, and other incomprehensible glories, but that which is near to us, and of like nature with us, is to be the object of tender love: </p><p>Dem zierat Genuss in freud, gem Triebe, </p><p>Und im Genuss nur keno' ich Liebe. </p><p>He is interrupted by Biterolf, who impetuously and scornfully challenges Tannh user to a strife of weapons instead of song. Biterolf, like the other opponents of Tannh user, is encouraged with loud signs of applause, and Tannh user, provoked, answers him with scornful bitterness. Immediately there is a tumult and a clashing of swords. Wolfram tries to restore peace, and sings with new enthusiasm in honour of pure, exalted love. Tannh user, beside himself with indignation at the scorn and bitterness of which he is the object, scarcely hears Wolfram, and bursts into a song in praise of Venus, declaring that he alone knows what love is who has been in the Venusberg:</p><p>Arrasel 'ge, die ihr Liebe nie genossen, </p><p>Zieht bin, zieht in der Berg der Venus </p><p>	ein!</p><p>A cry of horror arises at the mention of this unhallowed name. The noble ladies, shocked at this insult to their delicacy, flee from the hall; the men draw their swords and fall on the bold sinner, whose long absence is now explained. But Elizabeth, who on this fearful avowal is at first completely overwhelmed, suddenly throws herself as a shield before her lover. All are amazed that she can defend one who has so betrayed her, but she exclaims, 'What of me! But he his salvation! Will you rob him of eternal salvation?' Overcome by her noble devotion, all retire, and Tannh user, melted into penitence and hope by this sublime love, rushes to unite himself with the pilgrims to Rome, whose chant is now heard without, there to seek forgiveness for his dreadful sin. </p><p>The third act opens with the return of pilgrims, whose procession winds through the same valley, near the Wartburg, where the Landgrave found Tannh user. Elizabeth, who has been awaiting his return through long days and nights of prayer and weeping, is wandering through this valley in the evening. A thrilling moment in the drama is that when Elizabeth scrutinizes the faces of all the pilgrims as they kneel before the image of the Virgin, in the hope of finding her lover among them. He is not there. As the pilgrims pass on, she sinks down before the image, and pours forth the anguish of her heart in a prayer for her lover. When she rises to return to the castle, Wolfram, who has approached in the interval, offers to accompany her, but in vain. Meanwhile the evening deepens, and in the gloom of twilight Tannh user, transformed from the brilliant knight and minstrel into a withered and ragged pilgrim, returns in solitude. Wolfram with difficulty recognises him, and eagerly questions him concerning his fate, on which hangs the peace of Elizabeth. Tannh user only answers ironically, inquiring the way to the Venus Grotto, Struck with horror, Wolfram nevertheless will not give up the man who is be loved by Elizabeth; he continues his questions, and Tannh user at length gives him a description of his pilgrimage how, full of penitence and thirsting for reconciliation, he had inflicted every possible penance on himself on his way to Rome; how, on the confession of his sin, the bishop had denied him absolution, declaring that the man who had been in the Venusberg could no more win pardon than the pastoral staff in his hand could bud with fresh green; and how, hopeless on earth and in heaven, he was now returning to the goddess who had predicted to him this rejection. (According to the legend, the bishop, after Tannh user had departed, found his pastoral staff had actually budded, as a reproof to his inexorable severity.) Tannh user now rises to take his way to the Venusberg, and the voices of the syrens are heard singing their old strain of enticement. Wolfram holds him back with all his force, but can only succeed in neutralizing the unholy charm by uttering the name of Elizabeth. Once more this name exercises its saving power. Immediately the seductive melodies are silenced, and Tannh user repeats the beloved name with the same rapture and hope as ever. At this moment a funeral procession approaches, bearing Elizabeth to the grave. He falls down beside the corpse, and exclaiming, 'Holy Eliza beth, pray for me!' dies. As soon as the long procession, led by the Landgrave, has filled the scene, the sun rises over the valley, and in the same moment all break into a chorus, 'Alleluja! he is saved!' joined in by a band of pilgrims who have just come from Borne, bringing news of the salvation which has been announced to the inexorable bishop bythe budding of his staff. </p><p>The theme of Lohengrin, which I must only allow myself to sketch very rapidly, is taken from the romantic poetry of the middle ages. To understand it we must know the legend of the Holy Graal. This was a dish made of a precious stone which fell from the crown of Lucifer on his expulsion from heaven. In this dish the Saviour blessed the bread and wine at the Last Supper, and Joseph of Arimathea received the blood that streamed from the wounded side of Jesus on the cross. Joseph of Arimathea brought the Holy Graal to the West, where it at length came under the charge of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A glorious temple was built for it on Mont Salvage, a mountain in Biscay, encircled with a forest of cedars and cypresses. Here it was served by loyal and brave knights, chosen bythe Holy Graal itself, which, like the high priest's breastplate, had a mode of giving revelations. One of the bravest and most devout of these knights was Lohengrin, and the pathetic story of his championship and love for Elsa of Brabant forms the theme of the opera.</p><p>The scene of the first act is on the shores of the Scheldt. Henry the Fowler, the German King, has come into Brabant to summon its nobles to aid him, their feudal lord, in his war against the Hungarians. Frederic of Telramund, a rejected lover of Elsa or Alice, who by her brother's mysterious death has become Duchess of Brabant, seizes this occasion, under the instigation of his wife Ortruda, who is a sorceress, to accuse Elsa of her brother's murder. The truth is, that Ortruda herself has by her sorceries changed the brother into a swan, and that by this accusation of Elsa she means to clear the way for her own hereditary pretensions to the duchy. When Elsa denies the charge, Henry the Fowler de crees that an appeal shall be made to heaven by single combat, if Elsa can find a champion. She declares that she has seen a knight in a vision, who will come and defend her, and on the double summons of the trumpet, a boat is seen approaching along the Scheldt, drawn by a swan. From it lands a knight in silver armour, with a golden horn at his side, as seen by Elsa in her vision; while the swan sails slowly away again. Elsa recognises the knight with rapture, and in reply to his wish, promises to be his forever, when he has cleared her fame. Telramund is overthrown in the combat, and the act ends with the raising of Lohengrin and Elsa on shields, in sign that they are accepted rulers. </p><p>The second act opens in the town of Antwerp. It is night, and Frederic of Telramund, and his wife Ortruda, now sunk in disgrace and condemned to banishment, are seated on the steps of the cathedral, opposite the palace, which is lighted up. Ortruda, with stinging sarcasms, reproaches Frederic for his deep debasement, informs him that if the </p><p>stranger knight is required to tell  his name, and whence he comes, his power will be at an end, and suggests to him to betray Elsa into making</p><p>this demand. At length Elsa appears in the balcony, Frederic retires, and Ortruda, by her feigned penitence, induces Elsa to take her into the palace, so that in the morning she presents herself in the marriage-train. Her insinuations to Elsa, and the public accusation of Frederic that Lohengrin has won the combat by foul magic, which will be evident if he be required to disclose his name and origin, though repelled for the moment, prepare the way for the tragic d nouement. The act closes with the entrance of the marriage procession into the cathedral. </p><p>The third act is divided into two parts. In the first part we have an exquisitely pathetic scene between Lohengrin and Elsa in their bridal chamber. The doubts with which Frederic and Ortruda have poisoned her mind, are heightened when Lohengrin tells her that he has come from a gloriousand happy lot, for which her love only is a full compensation. She dreads that he will yearn for that lot again that he will one day forsake her, and in spite of his assurance that her doubt alone can separate them, she is led on to utter the fatal demand that he should tell her his name and whence he comes. The words Lohengrin has dreaded have scarcely passed her lips, when she sees Telramund and four other nobles, lurking with drawn swords near the door. Uttering a cry of terror, she calls to Lohengrin to seize his sword, and in a moment he is fallen on by Frederic, whom, however, he lays dead at his feet, to the dismay of the other nobles, who fall on their knees before him. Lohengrin tells them to carry the corpse before the king's judgment-seat, and with tender sadness summons Elsa to robe herself, that she too may appear in the king's presence, where he will reveal to her his name and origin. Then follows the second part of the act, which takes place on the banks of the Scheldt. Here Lohengrin declares, before the assembled court, that he is a knight of the Holy Graal, and that it is one of the laws of their society, that in whatever deed of virtuous valour a knight engages, he shall be triumphant so long as his office remains concealed, but the secret once betrayed, he must flee from the eyes of the un initiated, and return to the temple on Mont Salvage. Complaining tones had been wafted to the Graal, revealing that a maiden was in distress, and while the knights were preparing to inquire of the sacred vessel whither one of them should be sent to relieve this distress, a swan came, leading a boat on the waters. Parcival, Lohengrin's father, knew this swan, that it was under an enchantment, and in obedience to a command of the sacred vessel, took it into the service of the Graal, that service being, after the lapse of a year, a means of dissolving every evil charm. Lohengrin was chosen as the champion of the distressed maiden, and committing himself to the guidance of the swan, was brought, as had been seen, to the shores of Brabant. But now, his bride having been seduced by guile to demand the betrayal of his name and office, he must partfrom her for ever. While Elsa and the rest are entreating him to stay, the swan is seen approaching once more along the Scheldt. Lohengrin turns to Elsa, and giving her his horn, his sword, and his ring, which she is to present to her brother when he shall return, released from enchantment by the power of the Holy Graal, he embraces her, and says a sad, lingering farewell:</p><p>Leb wohl! leb wohl! leb wohl, mem </p><p>	s sses Weib!</p><p>Leb wohl! mir z rnt der Graal wenn ich </p><p>	noch bleib!</p><p>He has reached the shore, and is ready to step into the boat, when, hearing the scornful voice of Ortruda rejoicing that he is going without restoring Elsa's brother, he kneels down in silent prayer. Suddenly a white dove descends on his neck; he rises joyfully, and loosens the chain that holds the swan, which instantly sinks into the water, and in its place appears the youth Gottfried, Elsa's brother. Lohengrin springs into the boat, which is now guided by the dove instead of the swan, and glides away. Elsa casts one last look of joy on her brother, then turns to the water, exclaiming, 'My husband! my hus band!' sees that Lohengrin is already in the distance, and uttering a cry of anguish, sinks lifeless into the arms of her brother. At this moment the curtain falls. </p><p>Of these three operas, we heard the Fliegender Holl nder to the greatest advantage, from the fact that the principal man's part, being a baritone, was filled by an excellent artist Herr Milde. His wife sang admirably, as the heroine in each of the operas; but Tannh user and Lohengrin absolutely demand a tenor with a voice, and the first tenor at Weimar had only 'intentions.' </p><p>It is charming to see how real an amusement the theatre is to the Weimar people. The greater number of places are occupied by subscribers, and there is no fuss about toilette or escort. The ladies come </p><p>alone, and slip quietly into their places without need of 'protection' a proof of civilization perhaps more than equivalent to our preeminence in patent locks and carriage springs and after the performance is over, you may see the same ladies following their servants, with lanterns, through streets innocent of gas, in which an oil lamp, suspended from a rope slung across from house to house, occasionally reveals to you the shafts of a cart or omnibus, conveniently placed for you to run upon them. </p><p>A yearly autumn festival at Weimar is the Vogelschiessen, or Bird shootiny; but the reader must not let his imagination wander at this word into fields and brakes. The bird here concerned is of wood, and the shooters, instead of wandering over breezy down and common, are shut up, day after day, in a room clouded with tobacco smoke, that they may take their turn at shooting with the rifle from the window of a closet about the size of a sentinel's box. However, this is a mighty enjoyment to the Thuringian yeomanry, and an occasion of profit to our friend Punch, and other itinerant performers; for while the Vogelschiessen lasts, a sort of fair is held in the field where the marks men assemble.</p><p>Among the quieter every-day pleasures of the Weimarians, perhaps the most delightful is a stroll on a bright afternoon or evening to Belvedere, one of the Duke's summer residences, about two miles Liszt, Wayner, from Weimar. A glorious avenue of chesnut trees leads all the way from the town to the entrance of the grounds, which are open to all the world as much as to the Duke himself. Close to the palace and its subsidiary buildings there is an inn, for the accommodation of the good people who come to take dinner, or any other meal here, by way of holiday making. A sort of pavilion stands on a spot commanding a lovely view of Weimar and its valley, and here the Weimarians constantly come on summer and autumn evenings to smoke a cigar, or drink a cup of coffee. In one wing of the little palace, which is made smart by wooden cupolas, with gilt pinnacles, there is a saloon, which I recommend to the imitation of tasteful people in their countryhouses. It has no decoration but that of natural foliage: ivy is trained at regular intervals up the pure white walls, and all round the edge of the ceiling, so as to form pilasters and a cornice; ivy again,trained on trellis-work, forms a blind to the window, which looks to wards the entrance-court; and beautiful ferns, arranged in tall baskets, are placed here and there against the walls. The furniture is of light cane-work. Another pretty thing here ia the Natur-Theater a theatre constructed with living trees, trimmed into walls and side scenes. We pleased ourselves for a little while with thinking that this was one of the places where Goethe acted in his own dramas, but we afterwards learned that it was not made until his acting days were over. The inexhaustible charm of Belvedere, however, is the grounds, which are laid out with a taste worthy of a first-rate landscape gardener. The tall and graceful limes, plane </p><p>trees, and weeping birches, the little basins of water here and there, with fountains playing in the middle of them, and with a fringe of broad leaved plants, or other tasteful bordering round them, the gradualdescent towards the river, and the hill clothed with firs and pines on the opposite side, forming a fine dark background for the various and light foliage of the trees that ornament the gardens all this we went again and again to enjoy, from the time when everything was of a vivid green until the Virginian creepers which festooned the silver steins of the birches were bright scarlet, and the touch of autumn had turned all the green to gold. One of the spots to linger in is at a semicircular seat against an artificial rock, on which are placed large glass globes of different colours. It is wonderful to see with what minute perfection the scenery around is painted in these globes. Each is like a pre-Rafaelite picture, with every little detail of gravelly walk, mossy bank, and delicately-leaved, interlacing boughs, presented in accurate miniature. </p><p>In the opposite direction to Belvedere lies Tiefurt, with its small park and tiny chateau, formerly the residence of the Duchess Amalia, the mother of Carl August, and the friend and patroness of Weiland, but now apparently serving as little else than a receptacle for the late Duke Carl Friederich's rather childish collections. In the second story there is a suite of rooms, so small that the largest of them does not take up as much space as a good dining table, and each of these doll house rooms is crowded with prints, old china, and all sorts of knick knacks and rococo wares. The park is a little paradise. The Ilm is seen here to the best advantage: it is clearer than at Weimar, and winds about gracefully between the banks, on one side steep, and curtained with turf and shrubs, or fine trees. It was here, at a point where the bank forms a promontory into the river, that Goethe and his court friends got up the performance of an operetta Die Fischerin, by torchlight. On the way to Tiefurt lies the Webicht, a beautiful wood, through which run excellent carriage roads and grassy footpaths. It was a rich enjoyment to skirt this wood along the Jena road, and see the sky arching grandly down over the open fields on the other side of us, the evening red flushing the west over the town, and the stars coming out as if to relieve the sun in its watch; or to take the winding road through the wood, under its tall overarching trees, now bending their mossy trunks forward, now standing with the stately erectness of lofty pillars; or to saunter along the grassy footpaths where the sunlight streamed through the fairy-like foliage of the silvery barked birches.</p><p>Stout pedestrians who go to Weimar will do well to make a walking excursion, as we did, to Ettersburg, a more distant summer residence of the Grand Duke, interesting to us be forehand as the scene of private theatricals and sprees in the Goethe days. We set out on one of the brightest and hottest mornings that August ever bestowed, and it required some resolution to trudge along the shadeless chaus e, which formed the first two or three miles of our way. One compensating pleasure was the sight of the beautiful mountain ash trees in full berry, which, alternately with cherry trees, border the road for a considerable distance. At last </p><p>we rested from our broiling walk on the borders of a glorious pine wood, so extensive that the trees in the distance form a complete wall with their trunks, and so give one a twilight very welcome on a summer's noon. Under these pines you tread on a carpet of the softest moss, so that you hear no sound of a footstep, and all is as solemn and still as in the crypt of a cathedral. Presently we passed out of the pinewood into one of limes, beeches, and other trees of transparent and light foliage, and from this again we emerged into the open space of the Ettersburg Park in front of the Schloss, which is finely placed on an eminence commanding a magnificent view of the far-reaching woods. Prince P ckler Muskau has been of service here by recommending openings to be made in the woods, in the taste of the English parks. The Schloss, which is a favourite residence of the Grand Duke, is a house of very moderate size, and no pretension of any kind. Its stuccoed walls, and doors long unacquainted with fresh paint, would look distressingly shabby to the owner of a villa at Richmond or Twickenham; but much beauty is procured here at slight expense, by the tasteful disposition of creepers on the balustrades, and pretty vases full of plants ranged along the steps, or suspended in the little piazza beneath them. A walk through a beech wood took us to the Moosh tte, in front of which stands the famous beech from whence Goethe denounced Jacobi's Woldemar. The bark is covered with initials cut by him and his friends. </p><p>People who only allow themselves to be idle under the pretext of hydropathizing, may find all the apparatus necessary to satisfy their conscience at Bercka, a village seated in a lovely valley about six miles from Weimar. Now and then a Weimar family takes lodgings here for the summer, retiring from the quiet of the capital to the deeper quiet of Bercka; but generally the lace seems not much frequented. It would be difficult to imagine a more peace-inspiring scene than this little valley. The hanging woods the soft colouring and graceful out line of the uplands the village, with its roofs and spire of a reddish violet hue, muffled in luxuriant trees the white Kurhaus glittering on a grassy slope the avenue of poplars contrasting its pretty primness with the wild bushy outline of the wood-covered hill, which rises abruptlyfrom the smooth, green meadows the clear winding stream, now sparkling in the sun, now hiding itself under soft grey willows all this makes an enchanting picture. The walk to Bercka and back was a favourite expedition with us and a few Weimar friends, for the road thither is a pleasant one, leading at first through open cultivated fields, dotted here and there with villages, and then through wooded hills the out skirts of the Th ringian Forest. We used not to despise the fine plums which hung in tempting abundance by the roadside; but we afterwards found that we had been deceived in supposing ourselves free to pluck them, as if it were the golden age, and that we were liable to a penalty of ten groschen for our depredations.</p><p>But I must not allow myself to be exhaustive on pleasures which seem monotonous when told, though in enjoying them one is as far from wishing them to be more various as from wishing for any change in the sweet sameness of successive summer days. I will only advise the reader who has yet to make excursions in Th ringia to visit Jena, less for its traditions than for its fine scenery, which makes it, as Goethe says, ein allerliebster ort a delicious place, in spite of its dull, ugly streets; and exhort him, above all, to brave the discomforts of a postwagen for the sake of getting to Ilmenau. Here he will find the grandest pine-clad hills, with enless walks under thei solemn shades; beech woods where every tree is a picture; an air that he will breathe with as conscious a pleasure as if he were taking iced water on a hot day; baths ad libitum, with a douche lofty and tremendous enough to invigorate the giant Comoran; and, more than all, one of the most interestingmrelics of Goethe, who had  a great love for Ilmenau. This is the small wooden house, on the height called the Kickelhahn, where he often lived in his long retirements here, and where you may see written by his own hand near the window-frame, those wonderful lines perhaps the finest expression yet given to the sense of resignation inspired by the sublime calm of Nature:</p><p>Ueber allen Gipfeln </p><p>Ist Ruh, </p><p>In allen Wipfeln </p><p>Sp rest du </p><p>Kaum einen Hauch; </p><p>Die V gelein schweigen im Walde. </p><p>Warte nur, balde </p><p>Ruhest du auch. </p><p>LORD BROUGHAM'S LITERATURE. </p><p>Lives of Men of Letters of the Time of George III. By Henry Lord Brougham, P.R.S. </p><p>Griffin and Co. </p><p>It is matter of very common observation that members of the "privileged </p><p>classes," who, either from want of work or want of ability to do their proper </p><p>work, find the1r time hang rather heavily on their hands, try to get rid of it </p><p>by employments which, if not self-imposed, they would think rather pitiable. </p><p>Kings and emperors have turned their hands to making locks and sealing- </p><p>wax; ambassadresses have collected old stockings for the sake of darning </p><p>them; and we knew a wealthy old gentleman who devoted himself to making </p><p>pokers, which he presented to all the ladies of his acquaintance. It is ge- </p><p>nerally presumed of such people that if they had brains to enable them to do </p><p>anything better, they would prosecute this voluntary artisanship with less zeal; </p><p>still, the case of these incapables is one to be charitably smiled at or sighed </p><p>over, not gravely rebuked: we graciously accept the present of their lock </p><p>or their poker and say no more about it. But it would be a different affair </p><p>if these voluntary artisans were to set up shop - if, for example, Lord A., or </p><p>Sir B. C., or any other of the tribe of wealthy Englishmen to whom fo- </p><p>reigners give the generic title of milord, were not only to amuse himself </p><p>with making boots, but were to hire a shop frontage, with plate glass, and ' </p><p>exhibit his clumsy wares to the public with as much pomp and circumstance </p><p>as if he were a very Hoby, thereby inducing snobbish people to set the </p><p>fashion of wearing and crying up Lord A's boots, to the depreciation of</p><p>really well-made articles, and to the great detriment both of human candour </p><p>and the human foot. Political economists and bootmakers, lady-loves and </p><p>orthopoedists, science and aesthetics, would vote the aristocratic Crispin a </p><p>nuisance. </p><p>A sufficiently close parallel to this hypothetic case is suggested by Lord </p><p>Brougham's Lives of Men of Letters, the sight of which, republished in a </p><p>cheap form, bas, we confess, roused our critical gall. Relieved from the </p><p>labours of his chancellorship, Lord Brougham, we suppose, found a good </p><p>deal of leisure on his hands; and how did he employ it? By taking to </p><p>what we may call literary lock and poker-making - by writing third-rate </p><p>biographies in the style of a literary hack! Biographies, too, of men whose </p><p>lives had already been depicted in all sorts of ways, and presented to us in </p><p>all sorts of lights - like Prince Albert's face and legs. If we had found </p><p>these "Lives of Men of Letters" in a biographical dictionary we should </p><p>perhaps have thought them about up to the average of the piece-work </p><p>usually to be met with in such compilations; finding them, as we did more </p><p>than ten years ago, in an edition de luxe adorned with portraits, and with </p><p>Lord Brougham's name on the title-page, we felt some simmering indigna- </p><p>tion at such gratuitous mediocrities in a pretentious garb; and now that we </p><p>see them in a cheaper reissue - as if there were any demand for these clumsy </p><p>superfluities, these amateur locks and pokers - our indignation fairly boils </p><p>over. We have not the slightest wish to be disrespectful to Lord Brougham. </p><p>His name is connected with some of the greatest movements in the last half </p><p>century, and in general, is on the side of the liberal and the just. But he </p><p>has been a successful man; his reputation is fully equal to his merit; society </p><p>is unanimous in pronouncing that he has done many things well and wisely; </p><p>and there is, therefore, no reason why we should be reticent of our criticism </p><p>where, in our opinion, he has done some things less wisely and not well. </p><p>The first thing that strikes us in these Lives is the slovenliness of their </p><p>style, which is thrown almost ludicrously into relief by the fact that many </p><p>of Lord Brougham's pages are occupied with criticism of other men's </p><p>style. The hard-run literary man, who is every moment expecting the </p><p>knock of the printer's boy, has reason enough to renounce fastidiousness; </p><p>but his lordship, in the elegant case of his library, with no call impending </p><p>but that of the lunch or dinner-bell, might at least atone for the lack of </p><p>originality by finish - might, if he has no jewels to offer us, at least polish </p><p>his pebbles. How far he has done this we will let the reader judge by giving </p><p>some specimens of the manner in which Lord Brougham contrives </p><p>To blunt a moral and to spoil a tale. </p><p>One of his reproaches against Gibbon's style is, that it is "prone to adopt </p><p>false and mixed metaphors;" but we doubt whether the Decline and Fall </p><p>could furnish us with a more typical specimen of that kins than one which </p><p>he himself gives us in his life of Voltaire. "Proofs also remain," says Lord </p><p>Brougham, "which place beyond all doubt his (Voltaire's) kindness to </p><p>several worthless men, who repaid it with the black ingratitude so commonly </p><p>used as their current coin by the base and spiteful, who thus repay their </p><p>benefactors and salve their own wounded pride by pouring venom on the hand </p><p>that saved or served them." Again, in the life of Johnson, we read: "Assu- </p><p>redly, we may in vain search all the Mantuan tracery of sweets for any to </p><p>excel them in the beauty of numbers." It may be our ignorance of con- </p><p>fectionery that prevents us from perceiving what "tracery" can have to do </p><p>with "sweets;" as it is, however, we can only explain his lordship's meta- </p><p>phor by supposing tracery to be a misprint for tea-tray, since misprints </p><p>abound in this volume. Lord Brougham is very frequently quite as infeli-</p><p>citous in his phrases, and in the structure of his sentences, as in his meta- </p><p>phors. For example: "It is none of the least absurd parts of Condorcet's </p><p>work, that he, being so well versed in physical and mathematical science, </p><p>passes without any particular observation the writings of Voltaire on </p><p>physical subjects, when he was so competent to pronounce an opinion upon </p><p>their merits." "Condorcet was a man of science, no doubt, a good mathe- </p><p>matician; ,but he was in other respects of a middling understanding and </p><p>violent feelings." "The lady treated him with kindness, apparently as a </p><p>child; his friend St. Lambert did not much relish the matter, being unable </p><p>to adopt his singular habit of several lovers at one and the same time intimate </p><p>with one mistress." The style of Rousseau's Confessions, we are told, is "so </p><p>exquisitely graphic without any effort, and so accommodated to its subject </p><p>without any baseness, that there hardly exists another example of the miracles </p><p>which composition can perform." In the labour of turning his heavy sen- </p><p>tences, his lordship is sometimes oblivious of logic. Speaking of Johnson's </p><p>Latin verses to Mrs. Thrale, he says: "Such offences as 'Littera Skaiae'" </p><p>(sic - a misprint, of course, for littora), "for an Adonian in his Sapphics to </p><p>'Thralia dulcis,' would have called down his severe censure on any luckless </p><p>wight of Paris or Edinburgh who should peradventure have perpetrated </p><p>them; nor would his being the countryman of Polignac or of by for the </p><p>finest of modern Latinists, Buchanan, have operated except as an aggrava- </p><p>tion of the fault." Why should it? </p><p>Remembering Sydney Smith's verdict on Scotch "wut," we are not very </p><p>much surprised to find that Lord Brougham has some anticipation of a </p><p>Millennium when men will cease to perpetrate witticisms - when not only will </p><p>the lion eat straw like the ox, but latter-day Voltaires will be as heavy as </p><p>Scotch lawyers. At least, this is the only way in which we can interpret his </p><p>peroration to the Life of Voltaire. After an allusion in the previous sen- </p><p>tence to "the graces of his style" and "the spirit of his immortal wit," we </p><p>read: "But if ever the time shall arrive when men, intent solely on graver </p><p>matters, and bending their whole minds to things of solid importance, shall </p><p>be careless of such light accomplishments, and the writings  which now have so</p><p>great a relish more or less openly tasted, shall pass into oblivion, then," </p><p>&amp;c., &amp;c. We confess that we shudder at such a Millennium as much as </p><p>at one predicted by Dr. Cumming, or planned by Robert Owen. </p><p>Another striking characteristic of these Lives of Men of Letters is the </p><p>way in which the writer ignores what is not only notorious to all the </p><p>educated world, but notoriously well known to Lord Brougham. The long- </p><p>faced gravity with which he discourses on Voltaire's ridicule of religious </p><p>dogmas, and on Hume's abstinence from such ridicule, might lead to a very </p><p>ignorant reader to suppose that Lord Brougham had led a retired life, </p><p>chiefly in clerical and senile society, and could only with difficulty imagine a </p><p>man passing a joke on the Trinity. He says of Hume that "occasionally </p><p>his opinions were perceivable" in his conversation, and that one day the </p><p>inscription on the staircase of the college library, Christo et Musis has </p><p>oedes sacarunt cives Edinenses, actually "drew from the unbeliever an irre- </p><p>verent observation on the junction which the piety rather than the classical </p><p>purity of the good town had made between the worship of the heathen and </p><p>our own." Astounding! Even this distant allusion to such irreverence </p><p>might have had a pernicious effect by exciting in us an unhealthy desire to </p><p>know what the irreverent observation was, had we not remembered that </p><p>Hume had no wit, but only "wut," so that his joke was probably a feeble </p><p>one. . . . A still more surprising example of Lord Brougham's </p><p>ignoring system as a writer is his comment on Voltaire'a relation to Madame </p><p>du Chatelet. He thinks that on the whole there is no sufficient reason for </p><p>questioning that it was Platonic, and the chief grounds he alleges for this</p><p>conclusion are: that the laws of French society at that time, as well as now, </p><p>were exceedingly rigorous, that the relation was recognized by all their </p><p>friends, that Voltaire mentions Madame du Chatelet in his letters, and that </p><p>Frederick II. sent his regards to her! One would think it did not require </p><p>Lord Brougham's extensive acquaintance with the history of French society </p><p>in the days of Voltaire and Rousseau to know that, whatever may be the </p><p>truth of his conclusion, the grounds by which he supports it must sound like </p><p>irony rather than like a grave statement of fact; and, indeed, he himself, </p><p>on another page, having laid aside his ignoring spectacles, talks of Grimm </p><p>being the "professed lover of Madame d'Epinay," and of St. Lambert being </p><p>"the avowed lover" of Madame d'Houdetot. </p><p>We had marked several other points for notice, especially that very </p><p>remarkable criticism of Lord Brougham's on the Nouvelle Heloise, in which </p><p>he implies, that for a lover to remind bis mistreas that she had allowed him </p><p>to kiss her, is to tell her what a "forward, abandoned wanton she proved," </p><p>and his supposition, that because Johnson was sometimes wandering all </p><p>night in the streets with Savage he must necessarjly have indulged in cer- </p><p>tain vices "in their more crapulous form" (an unfortunate suggestion to </p><p>come from the Brougham of Jeffrey's letters, who is described as "roaming </p><p>the streets with the sons of Belial"). But we must remember that when </p><p>indignation makes reviews instead of Juvenalian verses, the result is not </p><p>equally enjoyable by the reader. So we restrain our noble rage, and say </p><p>good-by now and for ever to Lord Brougham's Lives of Men of Letters, </p><p>hoping that the next time we meet with any production of his we may be </p><p>able to express admiration as strongly as we have just now expressed the </p><p>reverse. </p><p>THE MORALITY OF WILHELM MEISETER. </p><p>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. From the German of Goethe. Translated by R. Dillan Boylan, Esq. (Bohn's Standard Library.)	H. G. Bohn,</p><p>PERHAPS Mr. Lewis's Life of Goethe, which we now see advertised, may throw some new light on the structure and purpose of the much-debated novel—Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. In the meantime, we are tempted by the appearance of a new translation to give the opinion which our present knowledge enables us to form on one or two aspects of this many-sided work. </p><p>Ask nineteen out of the twenty moderately educated persons what they think of Wilhelm Meister, and the answer will probably be—"I think it an immoral book; and besides, it is awfully dull: I was not able to read it." Whatever truth there may be in the first half of this judgment, the second half is a sufficient guarantee that the book is not likely to do any extensive injury in English society. Parents may let it lie on the drawing-room table without scruple, in the confidence that for youthful minds of the ordinary cast it will have no attractions, and that the exceptional youthful mind which is strongly arrested by it is of too powerful and peculiar a character to be trained according to educational dogmas. </p><p>But is Wilhelm Meister an immoral book? We think not: on the contrary, we think that it appears immoral to some minds because its morality has a grander orbit than any which can be measured by the calculations of the pulpit and of ordinary literature. Goethe, it is sometimes said, seems in this book to be almost destitute of moral bias: he shows no hatred of bad action, no warm sympathy with good ones, he writes like a passionless Mejuour, to whome all human things are interesting only as objects of intellectual contemplation. But we question whether the direct exhibition of a moral bias in the writer will make a book really moral in its influence. Try this on the first child that asks you to tell it a story. As long as you keep to an apparently impartial narrative of facts you will have earnest eyes fixed on you in rapt attention, but no sooner do you begin to betray symptoms of an intention to moralise, or to turn the current of facts towards a personal application, than the interest of your hearer will slacken, his eyes will ander, and the moral done will be doubly distasteful from the very sweet-meat in which you have attempted to insinuate it. One grand reason of this is, that the child is aware you are talking for it instead of from yourself, so that instead of carrying it along in a stream of sympathy with your own interest in the story, you give it the impression of contriving coldly and talking artificially. Now, the moralising novelist produces the same effect on his mature readers: an effect often heightened by the perception that the moralising is rather intended to make his book eligible for family reading than prompted by any profound conviction or enthusiasm. Just as far from being really moral is the so-called moral denouement, in which rewards and punishments are distributed according to those notions of justice on which the novel-writer would have recommended that the world should be governed if he had been consulted at the creation. The emotion of satisfaction wich a reader feels when the villain of the book dies of some hideous disease, or is crushed by a railway train, is no more essentially moral that the satisfaction which used to be felt in whipping culprits at the cart-tail. So we dismiss the chrage of immorality against Wilhelm Meister on these two counts—the absence of moral bias in the mode of narration, and the comfortable issues allowed to questionable notions and questionable characters.</p><p>But there ia nother ground for the same accusation which involves deepre considerations. It is said that some of the scenes and incidents are such as the refined moral tast of these days will no admit to be proper subjects for art, that to depict irregular relations in all the charms they really have for human nature, and to associate lovely qualities with vices which society makes a brand of outlawry, implies a toleration which is at once a sign and a source of perverted moral sentiment. Wilhelm's relation to Mariana and the charm which the reader is made to feel in the lawless Pillina, many incidents that occur during Wilhelm's life with the players, and the stories of Lothario's love in the present, preterite, and future, are shocking to the prevalent English. It is no answer to the objection to say—what is the fact—that Goethe's pictures are truthful, that the career of almost every young man brings him in contact with far more vitiating irregularities than say presented in the experience of Wilhelm Meister, for no one can maintain that all fact is a fit subject for art. The sphere of the artist has its fault somewhere, and the first question is, Has Goethe overstepped this limit, so that the mere fact of artistic representation is a mistake? The second: If his subjects are within the legitimate limits of art, is his mode of treatment such as to make his pictures pernicious? Surely the sphere of art suceeds wherever there is beauty either in a form, or thought, or feeling. A ray of sunlight falling on the dreariest sandbank will often serve the painter for a find picture; the tragedian may take for his subject the most hideous passions if they serve as the background for some divine deed of tenderness or heroism, and so the novelist may place before us every aspect of human life where there is some trait of love, or endurance, or helplessness to call forth our best sympathies. Balzae, perhaps the most wonderful writer of fiction the world has ever seen, has in many of his novels overstepped this limit. He drags us by his magic force through scene after scene of unimitigated vice, till the effect of walking among this human carrion is a moral nausea. But no one can say that Goethe has sinned in this way. </p><p>Everywhere he brings us into the presences of living, genergous humanity—mixed and erring, and self-deluding, but saved from utter corruption by the salt of some noble impulse, some disinterested effort, som beam of good nature, even though grotesque or homely. And his mode of treatment seems to us precisely that which is really moral in its influence. It is without exaggeration; he is in no haste to alarm readers into virture by melodramatic consequences; he quietly follows the stream of fact and of life; and waits patiently for the moral processes of nature as we all do for her material proccesses. The large tolerance of Goethe, which is markedly exhibited in Wilhelm Meister, is precisely that to which we point as the element of moral superiority. We all begin life by associating our passions with our moral prepossessions, by mistaking indignation for virtue, and many go through life without awaking from this illusion. These are the "insupportables juestes, qui du haut de leurs chaises d'or narguent les misères et les souffraneous de l'humanite." But a few are taught by their own falls and their own struggles, by their experience of sympathy, and help and goodness in the "publicans and sinners" of these modern days, that the line between the virtuous and vicious, so far from bein a necessary safeguard to morality, is itself an immoral fiction. Those who have been already taught this lesson will at once recognise the true morality of Goethe's works. Like Wilhelm Meister, they will be able to love the good in a Philina, and to reverence the far-seeing efforts of a Lothario.</p><p>THE FUTURE OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. </p><p>Gegenwart und Zukunft der Philosophie in Deutschland. [Present and Future of Philosophy in Germany.] Von. O. F. Gruppe.  Berlin: George Reimer, 1855.</p><p>"THE age of systems is passes....System is the childhood of philosophy: the manhood of philosophy is investigation." So says Professor Gruppe in the work of which we have given the title above, and we quote this dictum at the outset in order to propitiate those readers who might otherwise turn away with disgust from the mention of German philosophy, having registered a vow to trouble themselves no more with those spinners of elaborate cocoons--German system-mongers. </p><p>Perhaps, however, there are some of our readers who would not require any such password from Professor Gruppe; for although he is better known in England as a writer on classical literature than as a philosopher, still it is likely that many German scholars amongst us are acquainted with his two philosophical works, Antoeus, published in 1831, and Wendepunkt der Philosophie im neunzehuten Jahrkundert, published in 1834. He is a man of very various accomplishments, and throws his active intellect with equal fervour and facility into many channels--into poetry and politics as well as into classical literature and philosophy. This versatility in authorship is rare among erudite Germans, and is held rather in suspicion by them, in spite of the fact that some of their greatest men--Lessing, Herder, Goethe, and Schiller--were productive in several departments. Those who decry versatility--and there are many who do so in other countries besides Germany--seem to forgot the immense service rendered by the suggestiveness of versatile men, who come to a subject with fresh, unstrained minds. You have perhaps been spending much time and ingenuity in planning a house or in spinning a theory which seems to you to account satisfactorily for many things: an intelligent neighbour comes in, and you show him your plan, or explain to him your theory. He is not an accomplished architect, but he sees at once that you have put a door and a chimney in incompatible positions; he is not, perhaps, a profound thinker, but he makes an observation on your theory which directly shows you that it will not "hold water." Such is the service which the versatile man will often render to the patient, exclusive inquirer. To return to Professor Gruppe: he has vindicated his versatility by achieving more than an average success in more than one department; his Ariadne is one of the best books, if not the bery best, we have on the Greek Drama; his Cosmic System of the Greeks is an ingenious application of scholarship; many of his lyrical poems have considerable merit; and his Wendepunkt der Philosophie is a striking philosophical work, showing much acumen and independent thought. In the work now before us, which was originally intended to be a mere pamphlet, but which has swelled to a volume of nearly three hundred pages, he rapidly (and somewhat to allusively for the general reader) restates the views contained in his earlier philosophical works, the Antaeus and the Wendepunkt--views which twenty years of additional study and considerable experience as a professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Berlin have served to confirm and make clearer.</p><p>The object towards which Herr Gruppe chiefly directs his consideration is the Reformation of Logic, of the rectification of the method of philosophical inquiry, which, as he justly insists, is the essential preliminary to all true progress. It is, he says, simply to a reform in method that we owe all the splendid achievements of modern natural science, and it is only by the extension of that reform to every department of philosophical inquiry that here also any of what Bacon calls "fruit" can be obtained. In fact, the gist of his philosophical labours is partly to map out the road which John Mill (to whose work he seems to have given imperfect attention) has actually wrought out and made available. It is curious that while Locke is, on the one hand, accused of being the originator of the French Sensational Philosophy, he is, on the other hand, as in the present work, reproached for having formed a step towards the speculative systems of Germany, in admitting ideas of reflection, thus severing ideas from things. This, says Professor Gruppe, is the fundamental error of philosophy, and, from Parmenides downwards, has issued in nothing but the bewilderment of the human intellect. Kant's classification of Infinity and Universality as ideas  priori, and of Space and Time as purely subjective forms of intelligence, is a further elaboration of this fundamental error. These abstract is terms on which speculation has built its huge fabrics are simply the x and y by which we mark the boundary of our knowledge; they have no value except in connexion with the concrete. The abstract is derived from the concrete: what, then, can we expect from a philosophy the essence of which is the derivation of the concrete from the abstract? The chief argument is favour of  priori ideas, as insisted on by Leibnitz and Kant is, that they can never be arrived at by induction; that induction may lead to the general but never to the universal, and that, nevertheless, this idea of universality is found in speech and in thought with the mark of necessity. But this argument will not bear a rigid examination. The language of all peoples soon attains to the expressions all, universal, necessary, but these expressions have their origin purely in the observations of the senses; they are simply a practical expedient, and are valued only under certain well-known and presupposed conditions. To isolate such expressions, to operate with them apart from experience, to exalt their relative value into an absolute value, to deduce knowledge from them alone, and to make them a standing point higher than all experience--this, which is what Parmenides and all speculative philosophers since him have done, is an attempt to poise the universe on one's head, and no wonder if dizziness and delusion are the consequences.</p><p>These views are familiar enough to us in England, but to find them urged by a German professor is not so familiar. </p><p>A system of logic, says Herr Gruppe, which assigns the first place to general ideas, and makes them prior to judgment, inverts the true order of things. The true object of investigation is the formation of ideas from judgments, and in order to ascertain the law of their formation, we must direct our observation to those eases in which a new judgment or perception occurs, and is embodied in language, to the mental process which takes a discovery in natural science is made and is expressed in words, to the place when development of language, and to the application of language by children. In these three ways the formation of general ideas is daily carried forward. According to these tests, every judgment exhibits itself as a comparison, or perception of likeness in the midst of difference: the metaphor is no mere ornament of speech, but belongs to its essence, though usage gradually dispenses with it. When we say the evening sky is red, the lily is white, it may seem as if red and white were independent, immediate ideas; not so, when we say the sky is rose red or rosy, the lily snow-white or snowy. Again, when we hear a child call the neighbour's dog, not a dog, but Caro, because its own dog is named Caro, we see the origin of the idea of species, or of general ideas; this is the first step towards the remotest abstractions. A consideration of examples, taken from the doctrines of natural science, shows, what has hitherto been overlooked by logicians, that every true judgments inevitably alters the idea both of the subject and predicate. Thus, when we say granite is volcanic: a new quality is attributed to granite, and the predicate volcanic receibes a wider extension. Kant, then, was mistaken in regarding synthetical and analytical judgments as two distant classes. The true statement is, that every analytical judgment has previously been synthetic, and every synthetic judgment is such only once, and immediately become analytic. By a synthetic judgment, the idea of the predicate passes into that of the subject, and is incorporated with it, so that when I repeat this judgment it is necessarily analytic. Thus, from the simple act of judgment we ascend to the formation of ideas, to their modification, and their generalisation. And by a series of ascending generalisations we are led to the most comprehensive, abstract ideas. But by the side of these abstract ideas, to which we attain by an ascent from positive particulars, there is another set of ideas which owe their origin to unprecise expressions and mere devices of language, by which we bridge over our ignorance or eke out our limitation, and singularly enough these are the very ideas which have been enthroned as the absolute.</p><p>Professor Gruppe, in common with many before him, makes war against the syllogism as a petitio principii, and even seems to reject it altogether as an instrument. He seems to us not to have rightly apprehended Mill's analysis of the syllogism and the function he assigns to it, since he makes it an objection to that writer's views that he gives an important place to deduction in his method. Deduction, as Mills shows, is not properly opposed to induction, but to experiment, and is a means of registering and using the results of induction, indispensable to any great progess in science. But these are questions which this is not the place to discuss. </p><p>What then, asks Herr Gruppe in conclusion, is the future sphere of Philosophy? It must renounce metaphysics: it must renounce the ambitious attempt to form a theory of the universe, to know things in their causes and first principles. But in its function of determining logic or method, it is still the centre and heart of human knowledge, and it has to apply this method to the investigation of Psychology, with its subordinate department Aesthetics; to Ethics; and to the principles of Jurisprudence. A sufficient task! </p><p>These are rather abstruse subjects to enter on in a short space, but we have at least been able to present one point of interest to our readers, in the fact that a German professor of philosophy renounces the attempt to climb to heaven by the rainbow bridge of "the high priori road," and is content humbly to use his muscles in treading the uphill  posterior path which will lead, not indeed to heaven, but to an eminence whence we may see very bright and blessed things on earth.</p><p>LIFE AND OPINIONS OF MILTON. </p><p>An Account of the Life, Opinoin, and Writings of John Milton: with an Introduction to Paradise Lost. By Thomas Knightley. </p><p>Chapman and Hall. </p><p>THIS volume on Milton has been a labour of love to Mr. Knightley, and, as with all such labours where there is ability as well as love, the result is valuable. The biographical part is full without being prolix; all the accessible materials are well digested, and the evidence for questionable details carefully sifted: there are no bookmarking digressions from the history of Milton's life to the history of his period, but the reader finds as much illustrative information as is necessary. Those who are unacquainted with Milton's prose works may get a very fair idea of them from Mr. Knightley's analysis and extracts they may learn what were Milton's opinions, how he argued, and in what style he wrote prose; and perhaps in these days, when the chief place of study is the railway carriage, the majority of readers will be satisfied with this rapid camp d'oeil. Mr. Knightley does not seem to us to be always felicitous in his criticism of Milton's poems, but his comments, especially in the introduction to Paradise Lost, contain much that is highly suggestive.</p><p>The principal phases and incidents of Milton's life are familiar to us all the sentences of rustication passed on him at the university; the bright, idyllic days at Horton when his early poems were produced: the journey to Italy where he "found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner; " the prosaic transition to school-keeping in London City and inharmonious marriage with Mary Powell; his Latin secretaryship; his second and third ventures in matrimony, and small satisfaction in his daughter; the long days of blindness in which the Paradise Lost was poured forth by thirty lines at a time when a friendly pen happened to be near; and the quiet closing years when he might be seen "to sit in a coarse grey cloth coat at the door of his house in Bunhill Fields, in warm, sunny weather, to enjoy the fresh air, and so, as well as in his room to receive the visits of people of distinguished parts as well as quality." </p><p>Less familiar, because less generally interesting are Milton's religious opinions, which were not fully known until 1823, when Mr. Lemon, during his researches in the Old State Paper-office, happened in lay his hands on a Latin manuscript which proved to be the Treatise on Christain Doctrine, known to have been written by Milton. In this treatise we have a complete statement of Milton's theological and ethical views. That he was an Arian, a believer in free-will and in the universal efficacy of Christ's depth, had been already apparent to the understanding reader in the pages of Paradise Law: the Calvinists, it was evident, could not claim him as their own. His famous work, too, on the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, had sufficiently announced his departure from the prevalent opinion on that subject. The more unexpected points in the treatise on Christain doctrine are the position that polygamy is permitted by the law of Christ; the rejection of infant baptism; and the materialistic view of the human soul, that "man is not, according to the common opinion, made up and framed of two distinct and different natures, as of soul and body, but that the whole man is soul and the soul man." Milton was anti-Puritan in his view of the Sabbath, concurring with Luther in regarding the Christian day of rest as a matter of expediency to be regulated by the civil government, not as a mater of divine authority. </p><p>When Milton wrote his Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce he was pleading his own cause as well as urging a general argument, just as, two centuries later, Mrs. Norton has recently done, and is doing in her Letter to the Queen. There is much unreasonable prejudice against this blending of personal interest with a general protest. If we waited for the impulse of abstract benevolence or justice, we fear that most reforms would be postponed to the Greek Kalends, and in all matters where popular alarms used prejudices do not come into play, personal experience is considered the next qualification for hearing witness ot an evil. The Athenians, so far from sharing this ultra-delicate notion of ours, that a man is not to appear is a cause for the very reason that he has an interest in it, would allow no man to bring a case of litigation into court unless he had a personal concern is that easy they distrusted all disinterested officiousness as much as we should distrust a man who set up shop purely for the good of the community. The personal interest may lead to exaggeration, and may be unwisely thrust into prominence, but in itself it is assuredly not a ground fo silence but speech, until we have reached that stage in which the work of this world will be all done vicariously, everybody acting for some one else, and nobdy for himself.</p><p>Milton's plea for divorce, of course, drew down on him plenty of Presbyterian vituperation his book was "a wicked book," his error "too gross for refutation." Yet his style is singularly calm and dignified. He desires 'not that licence and levity and unconsented breach of faith should herein be countenanced, but that some conscionable and tender pity might be had of those who have unwarily, in a thing they never practised before, made themselves the bondmen of a luckless and helpless matrimony." We seem to see a trace of his own experience when he says, "Who knows not that the bashful muteness of a virgin may ofttimes hide all the unliveliness and natural sloth which is really unfit for conversation?"--and when he speaks of a "sober man" discovering that the appearance of modesty in the woman he has chosen hides a nature "to all the more estimable and superior purposes of matrimony useless and almost lifeless." There is pathos as well as force in the following passage:-- </p><p>And yet there follows upon this a worse temptation. Vor if he (the husband) he such as hath spent his youth unblamably, and laid up his chiefly earthly comforts in the enjoyment of a contented marriage, nor did neglect the furtherance which was to be obtained therein by constant prayers, when he shall find himself bound fast to as uncomplying discord of nature, or, as it oft happens, to an image of earth and phlegm with whom he looked to be the copartner of a sweet and gladsome society; and sees withal that his bondage is now inevitable; though he be almost the strongest Christian, he will be ready to despair in virtue and mutiny against Divine Providence." </p><p>A picture, alas! too often realised since the year 1644, when it was thus powerfully drawn. For want of a more modern pendant to Mrs. Norton's pleas, it is worth while to take up Milton's, and consider what such a mind as his had to urge on the husband's side of this painful subject. </p><p>Before taking leave of Mr. Knightley's volume, let us say that it is the best introduction we have seen to the study of Milton, and that we recommend it to out readers as a fund of knowldege at once instructive and delightful. </p><p>LOVE IN THE DRAMA. </p><p>Cours de Litterature Dramatique, on l'Usage des Passions dans le Drame. Par M. </p><p>Saint-Marc Girardin. Tome troisième.	Paris: Charpentier.</p><p>M. SAINT-MARC GIRARDIN is a writer who makes the public not only desire his volumes, but wait for them. The reason of this, in the case of the Cours de Littérature Dramatique, is that it consists of lectures given by him at the Sorbonne, so that the volumes can only appear after their contents have been delivered in "winged words." The first volume was published in 1843, the second in 1849, and it is only now, after the lapse of another six years, that we obtain the welcome third. Nothing can be more charmingly easy and conversational than the styles of these volumes. We have all experienced that "who writes about amusing books must himself be amusing," is as far from being an axiom as Johnson's immortal parody, "Who drives fat oxen must himself be fat;" and that a work on the belles lettres may be as drowsy as one on weights and measures. But M. Saint-Marc Girardin is one of those writers who make a graceful subject still more graceful; he enhances the beauty of the flowers he gathers by the tasteful way in which he weaves them together. Qualities which make him delightful as a critic are his ready appreciation of beauty, even when that beauty is mingled with much quaintness and absurdity, and his lively sensibility to every trait of genuine feeling. He has at once chastity and largeness of thought—not a common conjunction anywhere, and perhaps especially uncommon in France; he is liberal without being lax, and pure without the least soupçon of prudery.</p><p>In the latter part of his second volume he examined the three frand influences which have modified the character of Love, and, made us differ so widely from the ancients in our conception and presentation of that passion, namely, Christianity, chivalry, and the doctrine of Platonic love. In the present volume he pursues the subject of Love, and traces its modifications in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, by analysing, or rather graphically sketching the three typical romances. The Amadis, which represents chivalrous love in its more softened and effeminate stage; the Astrée, which mingles Platonic with chivalrous love, under the name of pastoral love; and the Clélia, which is the code of la galanterie honnéte, and "marks the apogee of woman's preponderance in the world and in literature." We recommend readers who would like to be told, in the pleasantest way, something about those antediluyian romances, to turn to this volume of M. Saint-Marc Girardin's. He will show them matter for admiration, even in D'Urfé and Mlle. Scudéry, and it is always worth while to widen our circle of admiration. After thus surveying the general expression of Love under the varying conditions of society, from antiquity down to the seventeeth century, M. Girardin enters on an examination of the purticular expressions given to this passion in the drama, the romance, and the pastoral, and it is this part of his work which is most attractive. He opens for us one book after another, perhaps lying dusty on our shelves, points out beautiful passages and significant traits, makes Theocritus appear the most tempting author in the world, and pastorals in general seem readable—which we humbly confess we have rarely found them—shows a fine appreciation of Shakespeare, and winds up by charming his reader's interest to Madame Deshoulières, who ought to be held in grateful recollection, if for nothing else, at least for having written those incisive lines— </p><p>	Nul n'est content de sa fortune,</p><p>	Ni mécontent de son esprit—</p><p>an epigram to which La Rochefoucauld has given a new dress in his Maximes. </p><p>It is of course impossible for us to follow him through this lengthy survey, so, by way of selection, we turn to his observations on Romeo and Juliet, in which he compares Shakspeare's tragedy with the novel of Luigi Da Porto. In the novel it is Juliet who makes the first advance to Romeo; at the first glance they exchange, the young maiden feels that her heart is no longer her own, and when the progress of the dance brings Romeo near to her, she says, "Welcome to my side, Messer Romeo." M. Girardin observes that this treatment of the subject is entirely in the spirit of ancient poetry, and he proceeds:—"Why, in ancient poetry and in the Italian novel, which is here in entire unision with ancient poetry, why do the women love before being loved? why do they feel the passion before inspiring it? and why, in modern poetry and romance, do we find the contrary? Dido loves Eneas before we know whether she was loved in return, and we may even doubt whether she was ever loved. Medea loves Jason before being loved by him. Is it that love-smitten heroines of antiquity had less modesty than the love-smitten heroines of modern times? or is it that the modern poets and romancers are more refined and reserved in the pictures they give of woman's sentiments? The manners of antiquity may explain why, in ancienty poetry, woman wants that reserve in feeling, and yet more in words, which is her rule in modern times. Shut up in the gyneccum, and never mixing in the society of men, who themselves found objects of love elsewhere, women were compelled, when love took possession of their hearts, to proffer the avowal of their passion; they must themselves reveal their secret, or let it remain for ever unknown. . . . . The less free woman is made by laws and conventionalities, the freer does she become through passion when she yields herslef up to it. Thus, the women whose passion made them famous in antiquity were compelled to forget at once the first and last proprieties of their sex. In order to be loved, they were forced to say that they loved; and hence ancient poetry was accustomed to represent its heroines as making the first avowals of love."</p><p>Mr. Girardin then goes on to say that Shakspeare,: "who is altogether a modern," differs in his treatment from the Italian novelist, in assigning the first movement and expression of love to Romeo; as if he meant to imply that Shakspeare is an example of the antithesis he has just been stating between ancient and modern love, or rather love-making. He could hardly have made a more unfortune selection of a case in point, for—inconvenient  as the fact may be for those whose creed includes at once the doctrine of Shakspeare's infallibility and the doctrines of modern propriety—Shakspeare's women have no more decided characteristic than the frankness with which they avow their love, not only to themselves, but to the men they love. If Romeo opens the duet of love with a few notes solo, Juliet soon strikes in and keeps it up in as impassioned a strain as he. Sweet Desdemona, "a maiden never bold," encourages Othello, not only be a "world of sighs," but by the broadest possible hint that he has won her heart. Rosalind, in her first interview with Orlando, tells him he has "overthrown more than his enemies;" Portia is eloquent in assurancees of her love before the casket is opened—</p><p>	One half of me is yours, the other half yours—</p><p>	Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then youngs,</p><p>	And so all your!</p><p>And this frankess towards the lover is generally followed up by the most impassioned soliloquies or confessions to confidants. Then there are the women who love without being loved in return, and some of whome even sue for love. Helena in All's Well that Ends Well, the Hellena in the Midsummer Night's Dream, the shepherdess Sylvia, Viola, and Olivia, who wooes so prettily that the action justifies itself. Curious it is to contrast these Shakspearean heroines with some of Walter Scott's painfully-discreet young ladies—the Edith Bellendens, ALice Bridgworths, and Miss Wardours! Whatever may be the respectability of these modern heroines, it is clear that little could be made of them dramaticallyl they are like trees trained in right lines by dint of wall and hammer. But we are wandering from the point we had undertaken to prove, namely, that Shakspeare cannot properly be contrasted with the ancients in the expression he gives to woman's love. If so—if this feminine frankness is not peculiar to the ancients, the cause of it in them must lie deeper than the restraints of the gyneceum, to which M. Girardin attributes it: it must be simply a natural manifestation which has only been gradually and partially repressed by the complex influences of modern civilisation. </p><p>In his criticism of Shakspeare, M. Girardin sometimes reminds us of the Germans by his discovery of profound philosophical intentions where Shakspeare had probably nothing more than poetical and dramatic intentions. For example, Caliban, he tells us, is meant in the first instance to typify the inevitable brutality of human nature in the savage state, in opposition to the marvellous stories of voyagers in Shakspeare's days; and in the second instance, when he "tastes of civilisation"—that is, of Trinculo's wine—Caliban is meant as a caveat to the hasty panegyrists of civilised life. But, unlike the Germans, M. Girardin touches lightly on such subjects—just dips his wings in the mare magnum of philosophical interpretation, but generally floats along in the lighter medium of tasteful criticism and quotation. He promises us, at some future time, a fourth volume on the dramatic treatment of religious enthusiasm, a volume which will come to us recommended by the memory of much pleasure due to its predecessors. </p><p>HEINE'S POEMS. </p><p>Pictures of Travel. Translated from the German of Henry Heine. By Charles G. Leland.</p><p>Trübner and Co. </p><p>NATURE one day resolved to make a witty German. But as the supreme paradox was not to be achieved all at once, it happened that in the ardour of a great purpose she mistook Hebrew blood for German, and while she was busy adding the wit, allowed the best moral qualities of the German to slip out of her hands. So, instead of the witty Teuton she intended, she would have produced merely a Voltairian Jew speaking the German language, if she had not, perceiving her mistake before it was too late, superadded, as some compensation for the want of morale, a passionate heart blending its emotions with the most delicate and imaginative sensibibty to the beauties of earth and sky, and a supreme lyrical genius, which could weave the wit, and the passion, and the imagination into songs light and lovely as the rainbows on the spray of the summer torrent. </p><p>Thus it came to pass that we have that wonderful human compound Heinrich Heine, a writer who is master of a German prose as light and subt!e and needle-pointed as Voltaire's French, and of a poetical style as crystalline, as graceful, and as musical as that of Goethe's best lyrics; but a writer who is destitute of the distinct moral conviction which often inspired Voltaire, and still more utterly destitute of the profound wisdom and the depth of love and reverence which roll like a deep river under the sparkling, dimpling surface of Goethe's song. Indeed, we know nothing more likely to impress a reader with the grander elements of Goethe's mind than a comparison of his lyrics with Heine's, for the very reason that Heine quite equals Goethe in all the charms of mere song, and has one quality mingling itself with his lyrical power which Goethe had not--namely, wit; or rather, to express more specifically, French esprit. For, alien as this quality might seem to passionate love-songs and thrilling legendary pictures, such as form the majority of Heine's poems, it is, nevertheless, almost everywhere present, giving your rising tears the accompaniment of a laugh, and, before you have lost the cold shudder at his spectral visions, appealing irresistably to  your sense of fun. We cannot agree with his very clever American translator that Humour is Heine's grand characteristic. He certainly has humour--perhaps even enough to set up at inferior genius as a humourist--but we think it will be found that his greatest effects in prose, and most of the contrasts that startle us in his poetry, arise from a Mephistophelean wit, a verneinender Geist, rather than from humour which affirms all that is genuinely human instead of denying it, and is, in fact, an exuberant sympathy acting in company with a sense of the ludicrous, while wit is the critical intellect acting in company with that same sense. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that there are many passages of Sterne-like humour in Heine, and herein he is leas akin to the French, and most nearly allied to the broader and deeper German nature, which atones for the want of esprit by something which esprit will never supersede--loving earnestness.</p><p>But it is time to turn from such rambling remarks to the object that suggested them--namely, the translation of Heine's Reisebilder, by a very gifted American. Of Heine, more even than the majority of poets, we must say that he is untranslatably felicitous. Many of his lyrics are mere gossamer webs--touch them, try to transfer them, and all their qualities disappear. Hence, when we praise Mr. Leland's translation--and we do so bery sincerely--we must not be understood to mean that it will give the English reader a true conception of Heine's genius. Mr. Leland has that grand requisite of a translator, rigourous faithfulness; he has also poetical sensibility, command of language, and an evidently acute perception of wit; in short, he spoils Heine's poems perhaps as little as it is possible to spoil them in a translation. This may not seem to be high praise, but we firmly believe it is the very highest praise that can ever be given to a translation of Heine's poems, and we recommend the reader who is hopeless of knowing these poems in the original to make his acquaintance with them through Mr. Leland's version. He, of course, succeeds best in the poems which are legendary and ballad-like rather than purely lyrical. We give one of these, which has again and again made the blood creep in our veins as we have read it:--</p><p>	The pale half-moon is floating</p><p>		Like a boat 'mid cloudy waves,</p><p>	Lone lies the pastor's cottage</p><p>		Amid the silent graves.</p><p>	The mother reads in the Bible,</p><p>		The son seems weary and weak;</p><p>	The eldest daughter is drowsy,</p><p>		While the youngest begins to speak.</p><p>	"Ah me!--how every minute</p><p>		Rolls by so drearily;</p><p>	Only when some one is buried,</p><p>		Have we anything here to see!"</p><p>	The mother murmured while reading,</p><p>		"Thou'rt wrong--they've brought but four</p><p>	Since thy poor father was buried</p><p>		Out there by the church yard door."</p><p>	The eldest daughter says, gaping,</p><p>		"No more will I hunger by you;</p><p>	I'll go to the Baron, to-morrow,</p><p>		He's wealthy, and fond of me too."</p><p>	The son bursts out into laughter,</p><p>		"Three hunters carouse in the Sun;</p><p>	They all can make gold, and gladly</p><p>		Will show me how it is done."</p><p>	The mother holds the Bible</p><p>		To his pale face in grief;</p><p>	"And wilt thou--wicked fellow--</p><p>		Become a highway theif?"</p><p>	A rapping is heard on the window,</p><p>		There trembles a warning hand;</p><p>	Without, in his black, church garments,</p><p>		They see their dead father stand.</p><p>The following is a very happy specimen of translation; it is easy and musical as an original:-- </p><p>	I know not what sorrow is o'er me,</p><p>		What spell is upon my heart;</p><p>	But a tale of old times is before me--</p><p>		A legend that will not depart.</p><p>	Night falls as I linger, dreaming,</p><p>		And calmly flows the Rhine;</p><p>	The peaks of the hills are gleaming</p><p>		In the golden sunset shine.</p><p>	A wondrous lovely maiden</p><p>		Sits high in glory there;</p><p>	Her rob with gems is laden,</p><p>		And she combeth her golden hair.</p><p>	And she spreads out the golden treasure,</p><p>		Still singing in harmony;</p><p>	And the song hath a mystical measure,</p><p>		And a wonderful melody.</p><p>	The boatman, when once she hath bound him</p><p>		Is lost in a wild sad love:</p><p>	He sees not the black rocks around him,</p><p>		He sees but the beauty above.</p><p>	Till he drowns amid mad waves ringing,</p><p>		And sinks with the fading sun;</p><p>	And that, with her magical singing,</p><p>		The witch of the Lurley hath done.</p><p>The next is more injured in the rendering, but we give it as a specimen of the most exquisite kind of pathos that Heine ever attains:-- </p><p>	In dreams I saw the loved one,</p><p>		A sorrowing, wearied form;</p><p>	Her beauty blanched and withered</p><p>		By many a dreary storm.</p><p>	A little babe she carried,</p><p>		Another child she led,</p><p>	And poverty and trouble</p><p>		In glance and garb I read.</p><p>	She trembled through the market,</p><p>		And face to face we met;</p><p>	And I calmly said, while sadly</p><p>		Her eyes on mine were set:</p><p>	"Come to my house, I pray thee, ·</p><p>		For thou art pale and thin;</p><p> 	And for thee, by my labour,</p><p>		Thy meat and drink I'll win.</p><p>	"And ,to thy little children</p><p>		I'll be a father mild:</p><p>	But most of all thy parent,</p><p>		Thou poor unhappy child."</p><p>	Nor will I ever tell thee</p><p>		That once I held thee dear;</p><p>	And if thou diest, then I</p><p>		Will weep upon thy bier.</p><p>MICHELET ON THE REFORMATION. </p><p>La Réforme. Par J. Michelet. </p><p>THIS volume on the Reformation, in which M. Michelet continues his History of France, is much more satisfactory to us than its predecessor on the Renaissance. It is less of a comment on history, and more of a history; it has less of theatrical effect and more of sober delineation. The student must not come to it for a close narration of details or for a presentation of document evidence, for M. Michelet, though writing from extensive and acute knowledge, does not make it his object to communicate that knowledge itself, but so to use its digested results, that the reader may see it in a panoramic view the true significance and relations of men and events. But he will find on the whole a masterly survey, though he may wish that the writer would less frequently adopt the oracular style of the inspired prophet, and that he would more frequently indicate the significance and tendency of characters and events by special facts as well as by general statements.</p><p>The historian could hardly have a grander and more varied subject to occupy his canvas. The birth of the French Reformation among the simple Vaudois of the Alps, the Austrian Empire under Charles V. representing the reaction against the Protestant movement, and the Turkish power forming a check on Austrian predominance, and in some degree lifting up the pressure of Catholicism from central Europe,--these are the principal forces of which M. Michelet traces the agency. The individuals whom he depicts with the care and closeness of portraiture, are Francis I., whose romantic fortunes have led to so strange an idealisation of his gross and dastardly nature, his devoted and accomplished sister, Margaret of Navarre, the vicious queen-mother Louise of Savoy, and the Constable Bourbon. But instead of telling what M. Michelet has done, we shall perhaps do our readers better service if we translate a few of his frequent and picturesque passages, and thus show them something of what he has done. </p><p>	MARGARET OF NAVARRE</p><p>A poor poet, a charming prose writer, she had a delicate, rapid, and subtle intelligence, which tried its wings at every subject, alighted for a moment, never penetrating beneath the surface, touching the earth only with the point of her foot. We must, however, except the mystic jargon of the period, with which, following the guidance of her heavy spiritual director Briçonnet, she often loaded her light wings. That this mysticism was a preservative to her, I do not believe; on the contrary, it is one of the speedy ways to a fall. A much better guarantee was the laugh, the light irony, the gentle sarcasm with which she met the sighs of her admirers. And there was little merit in this absitnence, for she had in her heart two passions which created for her a continual alibi against all others. The one was the love of science, the infinite curiosity which made her pursue the studies least apt to attract women, languages and even erudition, leading her from Latin to Greek and from Greek to Hebrew. . . .The other passion was the astonishing worship, the love, the faith, the hope, the perfect devotion which she had, from birth till death, for the least worthy of all divinities, her brother Francis I. There are very few portraites of Margaret. That of Versailles is, I think, one of mere imagination suggested by some portrait of Francis. The true effigy is the reverse of a medal which bears on the other side her mother, Louise of Savoy. It is a slight image, a sketch, but full of revelations, opening up a whole character; and it corresponds so well and so precisely with all the written documents, that it makes one exclaim, "This is the truth." . . . It seems that the Savoyarde, of whom she was the first child, made her apprenticeship in maternity by this fragile and refined creature, the pure elixir of the race of Valois, before moulding le gros garçon qui gâta tout, the true son of Gargantua. Into him she poured all the carnal and sensual elements of her strong nature, so that, with considerable talent, the Habelaisian creature was nevertheless akin to both the pig and the monkey. Was he legitimate? Who knows? But Margaret his sister is certainly the grandchild of the poet Charles of Orleans. She has the face, early worn and faded, of noble, refined, and long-standing races. She says herself, without the least coquetry, when writing to younger persons: "Your aunt," or "Your old mother." . . . This exquisitely pure person had her whole life filled by a unique sentiment, which one knows not how to name; love? friendship? fraternity? maternity? Something of all these, no doubt; and not one of these names is unsuitable. The second volume of her letters, addressed entirely to the king, astonish and confound us, not by the vehemence but by the invariable permanence of a sentiment always the same, which has neither phases nor crises of dimunition or of increase--neither high or low. Never was the bow so constantly on the stretch. All the passions in the world must be humiliated before this. They have nothing to compare with it. The more tension they have the more readily do they break asunder. The only thing that reminds one of these letters is the immense and charming collection of Madame de Sévigné's letters. Those of Margaret are often equally charming (for example, when she writes to the captive king of what his children are doing), and above all, they are equally passionate--they express an emotion equally inexhaustible. Another point of resemblance is the hard levity and inconstancy of the beloved object. Francis I. is like Madame de Grignan. He loves, he is touched for the moment. But most often, he has little to say in return. This terrible fixity, during fifty years, who would hold out under it? Sometimes he loses patience, he is hard and tyrannical. This nature, so dependent, is evidently his property to use or abuse; ever since he was born he has had this being to adore him, whatever he may do. He will think it natural enough to ask, if he happens to want it, the life, the heart, the blood of this being, without its ever occurring to him that he asks too much. . . . Mere love is not so robust a passion. This not only resists jealousy and time, unkindness, mortifications, but much more: it resists the terribly prosaic changes which take place in the face, the temper, the health of Francis. When I think of the distressing portrait we have of him (about fifty years of age), cruelly disfigured, less by age than by diseases, I admire the magic prism through which she invariably saw this sun.</p><p>	THE TURK IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p><p>Christian war, justice of Christian peoples, Christian moderation, &amp;c.--all these phrases have been erased from our languages by the sack of Rome, of Tunis, and of Antwerp, by Pizarro and Cortez, by the slave trade, and the extermination of the Indians. What more did the Turks, even under Sellin? Under the other Sultans, especially under Solyman, they taught the Christians moderation in war, and gentleness in victory. Solyman made great efforts to save Rhodes from pillage. He consoled the Grand Master for his defeat, telling him: "It is the common lot of princes to lose cities and kingdoms." And turning towards Ibrahim, the intimate confidant of his thoughts: "It is not without sorrow that I turn this aged Christian out of his home." To Francis I., when a prisoner, be recals, by a noble and delicate allusion his grandfather Bajazet, the prisoner of Timour: "Take courage. It is no new thing for princes to fall into captivity. Our glorious ancestors were not the less victors and conquerors." The horror inspired by the Turks was due especially to the immense clouds of irregular troops of savage tribes which hovered around their armies. As to the armies of the Turks, strictly speaking, their marvelous order, ther discipline, was the astonishment of the sixteenth century. In 1526, two hundred thousand men traversed the whole empire, by the roads alone, avoiding all cultivated fields, and without taking a blade of grass. Every plunderer was hanged instantly, even if he belonged to the military chiefs and judges. In 1532 the envoy of Francis I. surveys with astonishment the prodigious army of Solyman, whose camp covered thirty miles. "Astonishing order, no violence. Tradesmen in perfect safety, even women going and coming, as in a European city. Life as safe, as free, and as easy as in Venice. There is such complete justice, that one is tempted to believe the Christians are now Turks, and the Turks become Christians." Except Venice and a few Frenchmen, no one in Europe understood the question or the East. Luther on this subject, as on that of the German peasants, undentood nothing; his genius abandoned him. If be has a glimmering, if he perceives for an instant that the real Turk is Charles V., he quickly retracts, and preaches submission to the Emperor with this distinguo: spiritual independence, temporal submission. As if the two things were separable! as if, in every human act, the soul and the body did not go together! Why did he not leave this absurdity to our Gallicans? To the peasants, he said: "Be Christians, and remain the serfs of the princes." To the princes, he said: "Be Christians, and serve the Emperor against the infidels." That is all the remedy Christianity offers us. Of the two questions confused by this vertigo, the one, that of the people, was destined to remain uncomprehended, buried, sealed under the earth. The other, that of the Turk, is seen clearly only in Italy. . . . The enemy of Christendom is the Emperor, the nominal chief of the Christian republic. But for his pecuniary embarrassments, his monstrous empire would swallow up Europe. But now, precisely in 1525, returns Cortez to lay at his feet the gold of Mexico. Every year, henceforth, the revenue of the mines, without control or discussion of States or Cortes, will aid him more and more. . . . . France, with so little moral vitality, and destitute of Indies, could not effectually oppose him. England distant, insular, will act little and by starts. If Henry VIII. divorces a Spanish wife, London remains not the less married to Antwerp. "Will Luther and Germany be more efficient? Will the Empire be the barrier against the Emperor? The Catholic princes are united by a hundred links to Austria. The Protestant princes and the terror of the people, and the insurrections of the peasants, are secondarily Protestants, but primarily princes. They are not likely to call to their defence the masses recently crushed. The only saviour is the Turk. Venice, quietly but energetically, efficaciously wrought upon this idea. It is she who, during ten years, and the ten most dangerous years, governed the Turkish Empire. A serious, attentive examination places the thing in full light. The Doge was eighty years old; Venice was in its decrepitude. Neither he nor his republic could profit by the policy. But the world was the gainer. By three solemn blows the enemy was repulsed. The religious liberties of Germany, still young and vacillating, were saved by the Turks; Luther by Mahomet. And a solid barrier was raised--Ottoman Hungary--at the gates of Vienna. At last Venice, failing, be­queathed to France her office of mediator between the two religions, initiator of the two worlds--let us say the word, saviour of Europe. Let us accept frankly, in the name of the Renaissance, the injurious epithet which Charles V. and Philip II. so often threw out against us. France, after Venice, was the great renegade, who, aiding the Turk defended Christendom against itself, preserved it from Spain and the King of the Inquisition. Let us give all honour to the men, the free and courageous spirits who, on the one side, from Paris, from Venice, on the other side, from Constantinople, stretched out the hand to each other across Europe, and, while cursed by her, saved her.</p><p>La terre eut beau frémir, le ciel eut beau tonner, they not the less carried out with an impious audacity the holy work which, by the reconciliation of Europe and Asia, created the new equilibrium, the more enlarged order of modern times; substituting for Chriatian harmony the harmony of humanity. </p><p>	THE VILLAS OF ITALY.</p><p>Lombardy was no longer what it had been. It had suffered cruelly, lost immensely. But, as happens in these great shipwrecks, the chosen places where the remnants are concentrated seem all the richer. I can believe, therefore, without difficulty, that the abbey and the villa arranged for the King of France would recal either the Granges of Sforza, or the Pouzzole of the King of Naples, and other voluptuous retreats which are made known to us by description. These villas were ravishing from the mixture of art and nature, of rural economy, such as the Italians love. Our châteaux, still military, seemed in their feudal haughtiness to cast to a distance the labour of the fields, the land of the peasants; splendidly wearisome, they offered as the sole promenade to their captiYe mistress a dismal terrace, without water or shade, where pined a few melancholy plants. On the contrary, the Italian villas, very superior in point of art and real museums, nevertheless admitted all sorts of gardens, extending themselves freely around in parks and varied cultivation. The companions of Charles VIII., who were the first to see them, have given pictures of them, full of feeling. Guarded at the vestibule by mute inhabitants of alabaster or porphyry, surrounded with porticoes "a mignons fenestrages," these charming dwellings concealed within not only a dazzling luxury of draperies, of beautiful silks, of Venetian crystals of a hundred colours, but also exquisite contrivances for pleasure and utility, in which everything was foreseen; various cellars, elaborate kitchens and laboratories, deep beds of down, and even Flemish carpets, on which, protected from the marble, a tiny foot might place itself on rising from the couch. Aerial terraces, hanging gardens, the most varied prospects. Close by, the idyllic labours of the fields. To the gushing waters of the marble fountain the stag, as well as the cow, coming fearlessly in the evening--the hay-harvest or the vintage--a Yirgilian life of gentle labours. All this set in the frame of a solemn distance--the marble Apennines, or the Alps with their eternal snows.</p><p>GERMAN MYTHOLOGY AND LEGEND. </p><p>I. Odin. Von Wolfgang Menzel.		London: D. Nutt.</p><p>II. Bayerische Sagen und Bräuche (Bavarian Legengs and Customs).	Von Friedrich</p><p> Panzer. Zweiter Band.		London: D. Nutt.</p><p>WHEN Tacitus said of the Germans: "They think it unfitting the majesty of the gods to confine them within walls, or to represent them under any human form"—"Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos, neque in ullam humani oris speciem assimilare, ex magnitudines cœlestium arbitrantur,"—he probably committed a mistake something like our anthropomorphic interpretations of the actions of animals, and attributted to a lofty positive principle what was simply the result of circumstnces chiefly negative. At the period when history first caught sight of the Northern tribes, they were already in the tumult of their great migrations, in which all the conditions necessary to the enshrining of a Religion in Art were wanting; and when the ruch of nations southward began to subside, Christianity was already baptising German men and German ideas with new names. Thus it was that one of the grandest and most purely indigenous mythologies in the world had only an ideal, and ultimately a written existence, and was never solidified into intelligible monuments such as the giant structure and statues of Egypt, the marble temples and divinities of Greece, or the myriad pictures and churches of Christianity. It was for want of being thus perpetuated in plastic symbols that the Northern Mythology was so neglected, and it is probably for the same reason that now, when ample materials for studying it are presented in a popular form, it fails to arrest attention except in minds of comprehensive culture. And yet the Odin religion has a strong attraction beyond its philosophic interest as a phase in the development of the human race: it has the poetic elements of power, terror, wildly capricious imagination, some tinges of pathos, and even a vein of humour. What is more grandly savage that the notion that the feast of the Walhalla and the tendance of the Valkyrien were for those alone who died in battle, while the feeble beings who allowed peaceful death to overtake them must go down to dim Helheim? What more pathetic that the story of Sigune's devotion to her husband the malignant Loki—how she perpetually holds a vessel to catch the viper's venom which would else drop on his face? What more fantastic extravagance than the rope that binds the terrible wolf Fenris, made, amongst other materials, of a maiden's beard and the sound of a cat's tread? </p><p>To the many excellet works through which the student may make himself acquainted with the Northern Mythology, Menzel, the well-known historian, added, just before his recent death, an admirable monograph on Odin, in which he has not only assembled all the myths relating directly or indirectly to Odin, but has treated the subject in that widely philosophic and historical spirit which makes it far more than a study of Mythology. One of the points which he brings into due clearness and prominence, is the unmoral character of the German as of the Greek Mythology. The highest god, Odin, was by no means the highest because he was good: the German was as far from holding any distinct Dualism as the Greek. The world was to him a battle-field where the law was death to the weak; Odin was chiefly the personification of warlike force, and to be "filled with the god" was to have the rage of the warrior which the appalled Romans named the furor teutonicus. Menzel also traces the reminiscences of Odin which still survive among the people—travestied in their course through twenty centuries; and this is not the least interesting part of his interesting book.</p><p>Another field in the history of the German popular imagination is opened up to us in Panzer's diligent work on the Legends and Customs of Bavaria. Catholicism not only absorbs into itself all Pagan legend, but retains the popular mind at that stage in which it is the ever-teeming source of new legends; and Bavaria is of all countries the most prolific in these often pretty weeds of an untilled soil. A significant example of the state of popular culture in Bavaria is the following fact stated by Panzer:— </p><p>When in the year 1815 a Bavarian regiment in France was on the march, and it rained incessantly, the superstitious among the soldiers clenched their fists against the heavy clouds, and threatened St. Peter, whom they regarded as causing the heavy rain in order to make their march difficult. "If we had him," said they, "we would make him run the gauntlet!" The regiment marched over a bridge on which stood the image of St. John Nepomuck. A soldier hastily put the image under his cloak. When the regiment halted, several hundred men ran up a hill at a little distance, bound the image to the back of a comrade, made themselves into a wall on each side, and obliged St. John Nepomuck to run the gauntlet instead of Peter. Each soldier gave the image a cut with his sharp sword until it was so hacked away that the bearer began to fear for his own back. </p><p>We must find space, too, for a legend which is a very amusing specimen of what we may call the Apocryphal Gospel of Bavaria. Legend, while lavish in incident, is often economical in personages, and loves to father all its marvels on a few principle heroes. Thus we find Christ and Peter engaged in the most unexpected adventures:— </p><p>Christ and Peter passed by a smithy where they saw written up, "A Workman above all Workmen." Peter said to the Lord, "Master, I believe there is no greater workman than thou." "Go," answered the Lord, "and ask the smith why he has written this above his door?" The smith answered, "Because I am such!" So the divine wanderers came to the smith, who boasted that he was able to make everything speedily, and ordered him to make an iron lattice round his yard. Straightway the smith set to work with his journeymen, and in a short time there stood a beautiful iron lattice round the whole yard. "Are you also smiths?" asked the smith. "Yes," answered the Lord, "and this," pointing to Peter, "is my journeyman." "Can you also make something?" further asked the smith. "We can make young women out of old ones," replied the Lord. "Well, then, mkae my old mother young, if you can!" said the smith, thinking to himself, that they certainly cannot do. "Where is she?" asked the Lord. "She is cutting grass cut there in the meadow," answered the smith. "Bring her here!" commanded the Lord. The brought a little old, black, hump-backed, withered woman, who readily consented when the Lord asked her whether she would be made young again. The Lord went up to the little woman, blew upon her, and she was dead. Then he and Peter laid her in the smith's furnace, with many coals upon her, and Peter blew the bellows so hard that the furnace was glowing. Hereupon the Lord drew her out of the fire, laid her on the anvil, commanded Peter to take the largest hammer, and both hammered so bravely that fire and shreds flew from her. Then the Lord laid the little woman again in the furnace, Peter blew the bellows, the Lord laid her again on the anvil, and they hammered out the head, body, hands, and feet all new. When that was done, the Lord blew in the woman's mouth, and immediately a beautiful maiden stood there. They took but small payment, and went on their way. And now the women of the neighbourhood ran together and could not enough admire the beauty of the maiden. "I would give a good deal of money," said a rich old dame, "if I could be so restored." Said the smith: "I also can earn the money; I have learned the whole trick from the two travellers." Immediately a beginning was made with the elderly dame. The smith blew upon her, but she remained alive. Said the smith: "If we once put her in the fire she will be dead." They made a good fire, laid the dame living in the furnace with many coals upon her, and the journeyman had to blow the bellows right well, but the dame was terribly burnt. They laid her on the anvil and hammered her, so that she was beaten to pieces, and great pieces flew from her which they could not fasten to again. And they blew into her mouth, but all in vain. ANd when they saw no end to their trouble and fear, the smith told his journeyman to run after the travellers and beg them to turn back. At first the Lord would give no ear to the journeyman, but at last he gave way to his urgent prayer, and returned with Peter to the smith. Here the "workman above all workmen" was almost in despair, and entreated the Lord in the humblest manner. The Lord said: "Let us see what is to be made of these shattered fragments." They laid the pieces together, put them in the fire, then on the anvil, and began again to hammer. When they had welded together all the bits, the Lord blew into the mouth:—what did the thing now become? A silly ape. "Nothing else," said the Lord, "Can ever be made of it."</p><p>BELLES LETTRES (OCTOBER 1855). </p><p>IF we were asked who among contemporary authors is likely to live in the next century, the name that would first and most unhesitatingly rise to our lips is that of Alfred Tennyson. He, at least, while belonging emphatically to his own age, while giving a voice to the struggles and the far-reaching thoughts of this nineteenth century, has those supreme artistic qualities which must make his a poet for all ages. As long. As long as the English language is spoken, the word-music of Tennyson must charm the ear; and when English has become a dead language, his wonderful concentration of thought into luminous speech, the exquisite pictures in which he has blended all the hues of reflection, feeling, and fancy, will cause him to be read as we read Homer, Pinder, and Horace. Thought and feeling, like carbon, will always be finding new forms for themselves, but once condense them into the diamonds of poetry, and the form, as well as the element, will be lasting. This is the sublime privilege of the artist to future generations, not merely through the indirect results of his work, but through his immediate creations; and all artists the one whose works are least in peril from the changing conditions of humanity, is the highest order of poet, who has received </p><p>"Aus Morgenduft gewebt und Sonnenklarbeit </p><p>Der Dichtung Schleier aus der Hand der Wahrheit." </p><p>Such a poet, by the suffrage of all competent judges among his countrymen, is Tennyson. His "Ulysses" is a pure little ingot of the same gold that runs through the ore of the Odyssey. It has the "large utterance " of the early epic, with that rich fruit of moral experience which it has required thousands of years to ripen. The "Morte d'Arthur" breathes the intensest spirit of chivalry in the pure and serene air of unselfish piety; and it falls on the ear with the rich, soothing melody of a Dona nobis swelling through the aisles of a cathedral. "Locksley Hall" has become, like Milton's minor poems, so familiar that we dare not quote it; it is the object of a sort of family affection which we all cherish, but think it is not good taste to mention. Then there are his idyls, such as the "Gardener's Daughter," works which in their kind have no rival, either in the past or present. But the time would fail us to tell of all we owe to Tennyson, for, with two or three exceptions, every poem in his two volumes is a favourite. The "Princess," too, with all that criticism has passages of inspiration and lyrical gems imbedded in it, which make it a fresh claim on our gratitude. But, last and greatest, came "In Memoriam," which to us enshrines the highest tendency of this age, as the Apollo Belvedere expressed the presence of a free and vigorous human spirit amidst a decaying civilization. Whatever was the immediate prompting of "In Memoriam," whatever the form under which the author represented his aim to himself, the deepest significance of the poem is the sanctification of human love as a religion. If, then, the voice that sang all these undying strains remained for ever after mute, we should have had no reason to reproach Tennyson with gifts inadequately used; we should rather have rejoiced in the thought that one who has sown for his fellow-men so much</p><p>"generous seed, </p><p>Fruitful of further thought and deed," </p><p>should at length be finding rest for his wings in a soft nest of home affections, and be living idyls, instead of writing them. </p><p>We could not prevail on ourselves to say what we think of "Maud,"1 without thus expressing our love and admiration of Tennyson. For that optical law by which an insignificant object, if near, excludes very great and glorious things that lie in the distance, has its moral parallel in the judgments of the public: men's speech is too apt to be exclusively determined by the unsuccessful deed or book of to-day, the successful doings and writings of past years being for the moment lost sight of. And even seen in the light of the most reverential criticism, the effect of "Maud" cannot be favourable to Tennyson's fame. Here and there only it contains a few lines in which he does not fall below himself. With these slight exceptions, he is everywhere saying, if not something that would be better left unsaid, something that he had already said better; and the finest sentiments that animate his other poems are entirely absent. We have in "Maud" scarcely more than residuum of Alfred Tennyson; the wide-sweeping intellect, the mild philosophy, the healthy pathos, the wondrous melody, have </p><p>1 "Maud, and other Poems." By Alfred Tennyson. London: Moxom. </p><p>almost all vanished, and left little more than a narrow scorn which piques itself on its scorn of narrowness, and a passion which clothes itself in exaggerated conceits. While to his other poems we turn incessantly with new distress that we cannot carry them all in our memory, of "Maud" we must say, if we say the truth, that excepting only a few passages, we wish to forget it as we should wish to forget a bad opera. And this not only because it wants the charms of mind and music which belong to his other poetry, but because its tone is throughout morbid; it opens to us the self-revelations of a morbid mind, and what it presents as the cure for this mental disease is itself only a morbid conception of human relations. </p><p>But we will abstain from general remarks, and make the reader acquainted with the plan and texture of the poem. It opens, like the gates of Pandemonium, "with horrible discord and jarring sound," with harsh and rugged hexameters, in which the hero, who is throughout the speaker, tells us something of his history and his views of society. It is impossible to suppose that, with so great a master of rhythm as Tennyson, this harshness and ruggedness are otherwise than intentional; so we must conclude that it is a device of his art thus to set our teeth on edge with his verses when he means to rouse our disgustby his descriptions; and that, writing of disagreeable things, he has made it a rule to write disagreeably. These hexameters, weak in logic and grating in sound, are undeniably strong in expression, and eat themselves with phosphoric eagerness into our memory, in spite of our will. The hero opens his story by telling us how "long since" his father was found dead in "the dreadful hollow behind the little wood," supposed to have committed suicide in despair at the ruin entailed on him by the failure of a great speculation; and he paints with terrible force that crisis in his boyhood:  </p><p>"I remember the time, for the roots of my hair were stirr'd </p><p>By a shuf.ed ste , by a dead weight trail'd, by a whisper'd fright, </p><p>And my ulses c osed their gates with a shock on my neart as I heard </p><p>The shrill-edged shriek of a mother divide the shuddering night." </p><p>An old neighbour "dropt off gorged" from that same speculation, and is now lord of the broad estate and the hall. These family sorrows and mortifications the hero regards as a direct result of the anti-social tendencies of Peace, which he proceeds to expose to us in all its hideousness; looking to war as the immediate curative for unwholesome lodging of the poor, adulteration of provisions, child-murder, and wife beating an effect which is as yet by no means visible in our police reports. It seems indeed that, in the opinion of our hero, nothing short of an invasion of our own coasts is the consummation devoutly to be wished: </p><p>"For I trust if an enemy's fleet came yonder round by the hill, </p><p>And the rushing battle-bolt sang from the three-decker out of the foam, </p><p>That the smoothfaced snubnosed rogue would leap from his counter and till, </p><p>And strike, if he could, were it but with his cheating yardwand, home." </p><p>From his deadly hatred of retail traders and susceptibility as to the adulteration of provisions, we were inclined to imagine that this modern Conrad, with a "devil in his sneer," but not a "laughing devil," had in his reduced circumstances taken a London lodging and endured much peculation in the shape of weekly bills, and much indigestion arising from unwholesome bread and beer. But no: we presently learn that he resides in a lone house not far from the Hall, and can still afford to keep "a man and a maid." And now, he says, the family is coming home to the Hall; the old blood-sucker, with his son and a daughter, Maud, whom he remembers as a little girl, "with her sweet purse-mouth, when my father dangled the grapes." He is determined not to fall in love with her, and the glance he gets of her as she passes in her carriage, assures him that he is in no danger from her cold and clear-cut face," </p><p>"Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null, </p><p>Dead perfection, no more." </p><p>However, he does not escape from this first glance without the "least little touch of the spleen," which the reader foresees is the germinal spot that is to develop itself into love. The first lines of any beauty in the poem are those in which he describes the "cold and clear-cut face," breaking his sleep, and haunting him "star-sweet on a gloom profound," till he gets up and walks away the wintry night in his own dark garden. Then Maud seems to look haughtily on him as she returns his bow, and he makes fierce resolves to flee from the cruel madness of love, and more especially from the love of Maud, who is all </p><p>unmeet for a wife;" but presently he hears her voice, which has a more irresistible magic even than her face. By-and-bye she looks more benignantly on him, but his suspicious heart dares not sun itself in her smile, lest her brother </p><p>"That jewell'd mass of millinery,</p><p>That oil'd and curl'd Assyrian Bull," </p><p>may have prompted her to this benignity as a mode of canvassing for a vote at the coming election. A fresh circumstance is now added in the form of a new-made lord, apparently a suitor of Maud's </p><p>	"a captain, a padded shape,</p><p>A bought commission, a waxen face, </p><p>A rabbit mouth that is ever agape." </p><p>Very indignant is our hero with this lord's grandfather, for having made his fortune by a coal-mine, though the consideration that the said grandfather is now in "a blacker pit," is somewhat soothing to his chafed feelings. In the denunciations we have here of new-made fortunes, new titles, new houses, and new suits of clothes, it is evidently Mr. Tennyson's aversion, and not merely his hero's morbid mood, that speaks; and we must say, that this immense expenditure of gall on trivial social phases, seems to us intrinsically petty and snobbish. The gall presently overflows, as gall is apt to do, without any visible sequence of association, on Mr. Bright, who is denounced as  </p><p>"This broad-brimm'd hawker of holy things, </p><p>Whose ear is stuft with his cotton, and rings </p><p>Even in dreams to the chink of his pence." </p><p>In a second edition of "Maud," we hope these lines will no longer appear on Tennyson's page: we hope he will by that time have recovered the spirit in which he once wrote how the "wise of heart" </p><p>"Would love the gleams of cod that broke </p><p>From either side, nor veil is eyes." </p><p>On the next page, he gives us an agreeable change of key in a little lyric, which will remind the German reader of Thekla's song. Here is the second stanza: </p><p>"Let the sweet heavens endure, </p><p>	Not close and darken above me,</p><p>Before I am quite, quite sure </p><p>	That there is one to love me;</p><p>Then let come what come may </p><p>	To a life that has been so sad,</p><p>I shall have had my day." </p><p>At length, after many alternations of feeling and metre, our hero becomes assured that he is Maud's accepted lover, and stones for rather a silly outburst, in which he requests the sky to </p><p>"Blush from West to East, </p><p>	Blush from East to West,</p><p>Till the 'West is East, </p><p>	Blush it thro' the west,"</p><p>by some very fine lines, of which we can only afford to quote the concluding ones: </p><p>"Is that enchanted moan only the swell </p><p>Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay? </p><p>And hark the clock within, the silver knell </p><p>Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white,</p><p>And died to live, long as my pulses play; </p><p>But now by this my love has closed or sight </p><p>And given false death her hand, and stol'n away </p><p>To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell </p><p>Among the fragments of the golden day. </p><p>May nothing there her maiden grace affright! </p><p>Dear heart, feel with thee the drowsy spell. </p><p>My bride to be, my evermore delight, </p><p>My own heart's heart and ownest own, farewell. </p><p>It is but for a little space I go: </p><p>And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell </p><p>Beat to the noiseless music of the night! </p><p>Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow </p><p>Of your soft splendours that on look so bright? </p><p>I have climb'd nearer out of lonely Hell. </p><p>Beat, happy stars, timing with things below, </p><p>Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell, </p><p>Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe </p><p>That seems to draw but it shall not be so: </p><p>Let all be well, be well." </p><p>We are now approaching the crisis of the story. A grand dinner and a dance are to be held at the Hall, and the hero, not being invited, waits in the garden till the festivities are over, that Maud may then come out and show herself to him in all the glory of her ball-dress. Here occurs the invocation, which has been deservedly admired and quoted by every critic:  </p><p>"Come into the garden, Maud, </p><p>	For the black, night, has flown,  </p><p>Come into the garden, Maud, </p><p>	I am here at the gate alone;</p><p>And the woodbine spices are waited abroad, </p><p>	And the musk of the roses blown.</p><p>"For a breeze of morning moves, </p><p>	And the planet of Love is on high,</p><p>Beginning to faint in the light that she loves </p><p>	On a bed of daffodil sky,</p><p>To faint in the light of the sun she loves, </p><p>	To faint in his light, and to die."</p><p>Very exquisite is that descriptive bit, in the second stanza, where the music of the verse seems to faint and die like the star. Still the whole poem, which is too long for us to quote, is very inferior, as a poem of the Fancy, to the "Talking Oak." We do not, for a moment, believe in the sensibility of the roses and lilies in Mind's garden, as we believe in the thrills felt to his "inmost ring" by the "Old Oak of Summer Chace." This invocation is the topmost note of the lover's joy. The interview in the garden is disturbed by the "Assyrian Bull," and the "padded shape." A duel follows, in which the brother is killed. And now we find the hero an exile on the Breton coast, where, from delivering some stanzas of Natural Theology  propos of a shell, he proceeds to retrace the sad memories of his love, until he becomes mad. We have then a Bedlam soliloquy, in which he fancies himself dead, and mingles with the images of Maud, her father, and her brother, his early-fixed idea the police reports. From this madness he is recovered by the news that the Allies have declared war against Russia; whereupon he bursts into a p n, that</p><p>"the long, long canker of Peace is over and done." </p><p>It is possible, no doubt, to allegorize all this into a variety of edifying meanings; but it remains true, that the ground-notes of the poem are nothing more than hatred of peace and the Peace Society, hatred of commerce and coal-mines, hatred of young gentlemen with flourishing whiskers and padded coats, adoration of a clear-cut face, and faith in War as the unique social regenerator. Such are the sentiments, and such is the philosophy embodied in "Maud;" at least, for plain people perhaps, speaks well for Tennyson's genius, that it has refused to aid him much on themes so little worthy of his greatest self. Of the smaller poems, which, with the well-known "Ode," make up the volume, "The Brook" is rather a pretty idyl, and "The Daisy" a graceful, unaffected recollection of Italy; but no one of them is remarkable enough to be ranked with the author's best poems of the same class. </p><p>From Tennyson we pass to a still greater poet, who also thought it worth while to print some verses, which have for us no other than an historical value a value which it is possible "Maud" may have some day. An excellent introduction to Milton's works, together with a carefully-written biography, is given us in a compendious volume by Mr. Keightley.2 It is not our task here to dwell on the facts of Milton's life, but we may just mention for the benefit of readers who have a strong biographical interest in him, that they will find in this volume an excellent statement of the evidence which vindicates Milton from the charge of ill-conduct towards his children. Turning to the more purely literary portion of Mr. Keightley's book, if we except two digressions, one on the text of Shakspeare, and another on the allegorical intention of Dante's works, we may say that he has kept close to his subject, and has done his work conscientiously and well. His account of Milton's opinions is full and clear, and he treats them in an admirable spirit of soberness and liberality. Those who wish to have some idea of Milton's prose writings, without the expenditure of time requisite to become acquainted with them at first hand, will find precisely what they want in this volume, an account of the views contained in those writings, and well-chosen extracts as specimens of their style. A propos of Milton's prose style, we must remonstrate with Mr. Keightley for a slight inexactitude of citation, which looks like unfairness. In quoting, with condemnation, Hallam's criticism of Milton's prose style, he not only omits the praise which opens the paragraph, and breaks off in the middle of a sentence so as to leave out an admission of the "high beauties" that compensate for the faults; he also, in the very next page, misquotes the words he has just been copying, and represents Hallam as saying that Milton never reaches any harmony" a statement which most readers' memories will contradict. Hallam's actual assertion, that Milton's prose "seldom reaches any harmony," is less easily confuted. The famous and often-quoted passages in Milton's prose are so splendid, that, like the prize-fruit at horticultural shows, they are apt to give a false notion of the average; and if we go to the places whence they are culled, we are surprised to find them so exceptional as they are. One source of obscurity and monotony the great faults of his general style was his supreme contempt for short sentences, amusineg expressed in his "Apology for Smectymnuus," where he says of his antagonist, "Instead of well-sized periods, he greets us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies." Mr. Keightley, indeed, urges, in his zealous admiration of Milton, that "it may be questioned if too much lucidity may not sometimes be a fault, as it causes the attention to be too much relaxed;" but this is very much like saying that we shall see an object more effectually if we strain our sight in looking at it through a dim medium, than if our eyes are arrested at once by the object with out any thought of the medium. All effort to understand mere ex pression is an expenditure of strength, which must enfeeble instead of aiding our apprehension of ideas. We can imagine, indeed, that to a German a lucid style must be a serious obstacle to comprehension; he has been too much used to the twilight of sentences, where the writer </p><p>2 "Life, Opinions, and Writings, of John Milton." With an Introduction to "Paradise Lost." By Thomas Keightley. London: Chapman and Hall.</p><p>never sees the end from the beginning, to find his way readily in the broad daylight of clear writing; and we should think that to him Macaulay would be the toughest of all writers. But for the plain English intellect, we cannot agree with Mr. Keightley, that its perception will be at all aided by obscurity. </p><p>The magnificent impossibility put forth by Milton as a scheme of education in his famous Tractate, according to which boys were in nine years to become masters of all knowledge, all accomplishments,and "fraught with a universal insight into thin," includes a higher range of classical writers than any admitted into the curriculum he adopted in his own school. To his hypothetical pupils he gives, in one stage of their studies, "the choice historians, heroic poems, and Attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument, with all the famous political orations;" but to his actual pupils, according to the testimony of his nephew Philips, he was less liberal, confining them, with a few exceptions, to the driest of classical diet. "In Latin, the Four Scriptores Rei Rustic , Cato, Varro, Palladius, and Columella; great part of Pliny's Natural History, the medical work of Celsus, Vitruvius, and the Stratagems of Frontinus: to these prose works were added the philosophic poets Lucretius and Manilius. Such was the Latin course; the Greek was, from its very nature, somewhat better. It consisted of Hesiod (probably only the Works and Days), Aratus, Dionysius' Periegesis, Oppian, Quintus Smyrn us, and Apollonius Rhodius in poetry; while the prose course contained Plutarch's Placita Philosophorum, and on the Education of Children, Xenophon's Cyrop dia and Anabasis;  lian's Tactics, and the Stratagems of Poly nus." We think we see a double reason why this selection was less preposterous and unaccountable than Mr. Keightley pronounces it. Milton's true principle in education, that the reason must be cultivated as well as the imagination and memory, and that it must be cultivated by applying it to the sciences which are of immediate practical value in life, led him into what may seem an erroneous plan, simply because the conditions for carrying out that principle were not yet ripe. Modern science had but lately been born, and how limited was the progress it had made even among first-rate minds, may be judged from the fact that Milton himself held fast to the Ptolemaic system. So, in default of the "Principia," he gave his pupils De Sacro Bosco "De Sph ra;" in default of Linn us and Cuvier, he gave them Pliny; in default of Johnstone's "Physical Atlas," he gave them Dionysius' "Periegesis." And perhaps precisely because Milton was a great poet, he shrank from grinding down the fine gold of his favourite poets into lessons of syntax and prosody: he could better endure the mangling of Apollonius Rhodius than of Homer and Eschylus. As to the formation of a pure and correct taste by placing first-rate authors in the hands of boys, we think that result is quite an exceptional one; the ordinary effect is rather that of vulgarizing the finest products of genius by premature familiarity. Too early an intimacy with the highest, in any department, deadens the sensibility and robs the mature mind of its proper enjoyments. A child who has been taken to see the Alps at ten years of age is pitiable; he will never know the rush of thought and feeling which would have made the sight an epoch for his manhood.</p><p>But we must not dwell on this point, interesting as it is, for we have to recommend to the reader the Introduction to Paradise Lost, which winds up Mr. Keightley's volume, as well as his critical remarks all Milton's poems. He is rather an exact and diligent than a fascinating critic, and is less apt at bringing into relief beauties of diction and sentiment than at setting the student right on a point of etymology or prosody; but this also is a good service, and is the one least often rendered in these days, when writers are more given to be eloquent on their personal impressions than to aid us in seeing the outward fact. Mr. Keightley contributes the kind of close, suggestive information which is likely to be valuable to those who study Milton in earnest. On two points we wish he had been more full and particular: namely, on the degree in which the story of the Fall, both of the angels and of man, was created by Milton, and on the influence of his creations in determining popular theological notions. It helps us to understand how the poets of primitive ages gave fixity to national religions, when we find that in quite modern times an Epic gets itself accepted as a sort of gloss on the Scriptures, and that perhaps to the majority of English minds at this moment, it would be difficult to say how much of their belief about Satan, about the temptation of our "first parents," and the consequences of the Fall, is gathered from the Bible, and how much from Paradise Lost.</p><p>In accounting for Milton's play on words, for which he has been so reproached by the critics, Mr. Keightley points out what will perhaps be new and interesting to many of our readers. He says, </p><p>"They are no proof of Milton's bad taste, but spring from the same source as so many of his other errors his thraldom to the letter of Scripture, and his consequent persuasion that anything found there was, as being the dictation of the Spirit, right, and deserving of imitation. As examples, we need only remind the reader of the well-known 'beseeching or besieging,' 'brought into the world world of Woe,' &amp;c. In that very part of Scripture on which Milton founded his poem, we meet with the following instance of the Paranomasia, as writers on rhetoric denote this mode of playing upon words. 'And they were both naked ([?]) . . . and the serpent was subtle ([?]).' Again, in the same book (xxix. 10), 'and he watered (yashek) the flock . . . and kissed (yishaq) Rachel.' So also (Judges xv. 16), 'An Samson said, With the jaw of an ass ([?]) . . . . heaps upon heaps ([?]).' Many other instances will be found in other parts of Scripture, especially in the Prophets, more particularly in Isaiah, for whom Milton's admiration was most profound; something of the same kind may also be discorned in the Epistles of St. Paul." </p><p>A different kind of criticism from Mr. Keightley's, is that of M. Saint-Marc Girardin, who at length, after six years' interval, delights us with the third volumme of his "Cours de Litt rature Dramatique."3 The criticism here is entirely philosophucal and  sthetic, and it is conveyed with such exquisite ease and grace that</p><p>3 "Cours de Litt rature Dramatique on de l'usage des Passions dans le Drame." Par M. Saint-Mare Girardin. Tome troisi me. Paris: Carpentier, </p><p>the reader may think himself only amused when in fact he is being instructed; just as when we are rambling in the fields for pleasure, we are really drinking in health and strength. This charm of presentation is almost a national inheritance of Frenchmen; but M. Girardin's depth and purity of sentiment, his comprehensive knowledge and his freedom from everything factitious, are more exceptional characteristics among his countrymen. These volumes of his are simply a publication of lectures delivered at the Sorbonne, and we understand that it is still more delightful to hear M. Girardin than to read him; but for people who cannot have that higher pleasure, it is happy that these lectures, the ripe fruit of a rarely-gifted and cultivated mind, are perpetuated in three of Charpentier's convenient yellow duodecimos. Readers acquainted with the previous volumes will remember that after surveying the treatment of the family affections in ancient and modern literature, M. Girardin enters, towards the close of the second volume, on the consideration of Love, first as presented in the ancient drama, and then as modified by the three great influences of Christianity, Chivalry, and the doctrine of Platonic Love. He then shows how, from that crude and subordinate state of the passion which is indicated by the fact that the first great dramatist,  schylus, leaves it untouched, Love associated itself with more and more elements of human nature, and gradually attained the complexity and refinement of the feeling enshrined in the "Vita Nuova" of Dante, and in the Sonnets of Petrarch. In the third volume he pursues the subject, and traces the continual ascent of the passion through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries towards that acme of its power in which it became the key-note of all literature. The three grand ideals of Love during these two centuries are mirrored in three famous romances: the "Amadis," which represents chivalrous love in its less martial and more effeminate stage; the "Astr e," wherein chivalrous and platonic love are blended and transformed into pastoral love, the shepherd Celadon taking the place of the knight Amadis as the embodiment of a perfect lover; and lastly, the "Cl lie," in which Mademoiselle de Scud ry laid down the laws of la galanterie honn te, oddly enough choosing to put the sentiments of modern ultra-refinement into the mouths of the ancient Romans, and making Brutus, Tarquin, and Horatius Cocles talk like a Parisian at one of her own Samedis. This grotesque incongruity, however, as M. Girardin says, is merely on the surface: Mademoiselle de Scud ry never thought of depicting the Romans, and if we change the names of her characters, her romance becomes a genuine picture of French sentiments and French manners in the days of the Hotel de Rambouillet. The common style of allusion to the Grand Cyrus and the Cl lie, is so contemptuous, that perhaps many readers will be surprised, on taking up M. Girardin's volume, to find how much delicate observation and permanent superiority of sentiment his discriminating and genial criticism lays open, like fresh green herbage, from under the withered rubbish of transient affectations. Every one knows that the words galanterie and honn te homme have undergone as great a degradation of meaning as our words clerk and cunning: galanterie was originally that sentiment towards women in which ardour is chastened by chivalrous devotion and respect; l'honn te homme was a translation of the Italian cortegiano the equivalent of gentleman, and something more, for it included intellectual accomplishment as well as moral and external refinement. Let us hear something of what M. Girardin has to say on the galanterie of which l'honn te homme was the embodiment:</p><p>"The moral spirit of galanterie is not only pure and almost severe, since it prescribes constancy as the first duty of l'honn te homme; it is, moreover, delicate and lofty; it even borders on the super-refined, but on the side where super-refinement is the desire for perfection. Thus it does not hesitate to believe that in love, it is better to love than to be loved, because he who loves has pleasures of the heart which are not equalled by the pleasures of vanity enjoyed by him who is loved. In every case where affection is concerned, we enjoy more from what we feel than from what we inspire; we are happy in the one, we are only proud of the other. Parents give their children a thousand times more love than they receive, and it is this which constitutes the bliss of the bliss of paternal and maternal love. It is the same in every species of love: 'Il y faut chercher sa principale satisfaction en sa propre tendresse plut t qu'en celle d'autrui.' Do not suppose, however, that in the Cl lie only subtle and super-refined questions are discussed: there are discussions also on questions which relate not only to love, but to the world and the conduct to be observed in the world; and these conversations, although between the personages of Roman history, seem to belong to yesterday or to-day, for they turn upon the most ordinary subjects of social life. Is it really Prince Titus, or one of our contemporaries who speaks in this way? 'I confess,' said Prince Titus, 'that I cannot endure those people who, when they see ladies, sometimes say, I should like that lady very well for my mistress, but I would not have her for my wife; or who say on the contrary, I should like this lady for my wife, but I would not choose her for my mistress. For I think every thing that can render a wife agreeable is appropriate to a mistress, and that every thing which can make a mistress beloved renders a wife more charming, being certain that, with my disposition, I should not wish my mistress to be a coquette, and I should wish my wife to be as charming as my mistress.' This conversation is assuredly not one of mere galanteriel it touches on the condition of women in the world; it indicates, with a sagacity hidden under the badinage, where lies the true danger of this condition. The rank of women in modern society cannot, in fact, be perilled, except by their allowing a separation between love and marriage. The day in which men, as in ancient society, should have mistresses whom they wouldn never make their wives whom they would treat with all sorts of cold obervance in that day women would lose the rank which Christianity has given them in society: modest women would return of the gyneceum, and the others would remain in the world; the exile of the former, and the intercourse of the latter, would cause love to lose the elevated and generous character which it has in modern civilization.</p><p>"Thus the doctrine of galanterie, defended by those who are worthy to profess it, directly repudiates the maxims of worldly morality which degrades woman under the pretext of loving her. Let us not mistake: Cl lie, which, at the first glance, seems nothing more than a romance, full of a sort of amorous metaphysics which lends itself to ridicule, or a pedantic manual of gallantry, is, when studied more closely, a serious and curious book, wherein all the questions relating to the condition of women in the world are treated in a way at once piquant and judicious." </p><p>We see that Mademoiselle de Scud ry's ideas are by no means so antiquated as their garb, and that if she were to return to the world, she would be able, after a little initiation into our fashions, to write an edifying pamphlet on the "woman question." After thus casting a general survey over the development of Love by an examination of these typical romances, M. Girardin retraces his steps, in order to look more closely at the particular expressions of the passion in the Drama, the Romance, and the Pastoral. He adopts Bossuet's idyllic interpretation of Solomon's Song; dwells on the presentation of Love in Theocritus and in the Latin poets; points out the idyllic elements in the romances of chivalry, and criticises Wieland's remodelling of them in his Oberon; traces the course of the modern Pastoral in Italy, Spain, and England, and remarks with admirable discrimination on the degree in which it is present in Shakspeare. M. Girardin is particularly happy in his treatment of the Idyl, that exquisite creation by which civilised man takes refuge from the tainted air and passionate excitement of city life in an imaginary world, where meadow, field, and grove are people by beings as pure and peaceful and lovely as themselves. The necessity for contrast with the actual gives rise to the idyl as to all other imaginative creations, and thus idyllic poetry is one of the later products in literature: the Greek Pastoral was not born till ages after the Iliad, and its great master Theocritus was a courtier of Ptolemy Philadelphus. The remainder of the volume is occupied with an account of the Pastoral in France, and with two very interesting chapters on Unhappy Lovers and on Magic in Love. The strange caprices of this passion are some apology for the wild hopes of mankind that it could be controlled by the intestines of a hyena or the left bone of a toad's head, which Cornelius Agrippa recommends as the most potent instruments to attach the hearts of fair ones; and perhaps, after all, Medea, trying to win the heart of Jason with her herbs and incantations, was not much more irrational in her notions of cause and effect in love than some of her modern sisters. Ovid's advice, Ut ameris, amabilis esto if you wished to be loved, be lovable, might be very sage; but it probably sounded like rather melancholy irony to the ugly and the stupid. M. Girardin is not very diffuse on this subject of magic in love, but, like all good writers, he suggest more than he tells, and readers who wish for an agreeable stimulus to their thought will thank us for sending them to his pages. </p><p>In taking up a volume devoted to the "Parcival" of Wolfram von Eschenbach,4 we continue in the same range of subjects as with M. Saint-Marc Girardin; but we soon become aware of a wide difference in the treatment, a difference which reminds us of the sensations produced by seeing under a leaden sky a landscape, which when we looked at it before was made bright and various by the slanting beams of the evening sun. This study of the Parcival is creditable for its diligence and earnestness, but the subject is handled with too little artistic skill to be made attractive for the reader who happens to know nothing of German medi val literature, and those</p><p>4 "Le Parcival de Wolfram d'Eschenbach et la Legende du Saint Graal.

R R </p><p>who are better informed are likely to be impatient at the want of graphic skill and colouring which prevents the author from conveying any just impression of Wolfram as a poet. Even Gretchen's song in Faust Meine Ruh'ist hin does not surpass in pathos the plaint that Wolfram puts into the mouth of Sigune, and indeed the modern song reads like a beautiful echo of the elder one. A single stanza from Simrock's translation is enough to make Wolfram and his works an object of interest to all who can read German: </p><p>"Nach dem lichen Freunde </p><p>Ist all mein Schauen </p><p>Aus den Fenstern auf die Strasse, </p><p>Ueber Haid und nach den lichten Auen </p><p>Vergebens; ich ersp h'ihn allzuselten. </p><p>Drum m ssen meine Augen </p><p>Des Freundes Minne weinend theu'r entgelten." </p><p>Direct translations of such lines into French would be of little avail, but there is a mode of describing poems as of describing characters, which makes one long to know them, and this kind of skill Dr. Heimrich has at least not shown in the present volume. </p><p>Literary criticism, again, is the chief subject of the "Noctes Ambrosian ,"5 the first volume of which, as the reader foresees, "lies on our table." In turning it over we alight on an eloquent or humorous speech of the word-compelling Shepherd, which makes us glad for the moment to renew our acquaintance with him. Generally, however, we must admit that the effect produced on us by this first volume of the " Noctes" is regret, for Professor Wilson's sake, that they should be republished, so as to revive the association of coarse and virulent partizanship with that noble face of his, where refined sensibility seems blended with lion-like strength. Professor Ferrier, who, as Wilson's son-in-law, has been intrusted with the editing of his works, apologises for the "intromission" of such dialogues and parts of dialogues as were not written by Wilson on the ground of a "sacred duty," which he owes to the deceased. Some persons may be inclined to think that the "sacred duty" would have been better fulfilled if there had been more copious "intromissions," so that at least the worst passages of vulgar personality, dashed off on the spur of immediate demand and under the transient impulses of party-feeling, might not have been made to bear witness against Wilson in all the con spicuousness of a new edition, instead of being left to eternal sleep in the forgotten numbers of Blackwood. These passages are perhaps mild and gentlemanly compared with other effusions of his party, for the Tories carried on their war somewhat after the unchivalrous fashion of Lord Duncannon's reputed invention, which is to destroy the enemy by f tid smells; and Wilson, being a Tory, did as the Tories did assailed a man's complexion instead of his opinions, and not finding it easy to show the emptiness of his arguments, taunted him with the emptiness of his pocket. Looking at these dialogues </p><p>5 "Noctes Ambrosian ." By Professor Wilson. Vol. I. Edinburgh and London: Blackwood and Sons. </p><p>historically, one pleasant result may indeed be gathered to counterbalance Mr. Tennyson's forlorn picture of our social condition: namely, that public opinion has at least made some advance in moral taste </p><p>during the last quarter of a century. It is no longer possible for an accomplished man to offer for the amusement of the public anything at once so gross and feeble as the following charade directed against Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt, in a dialogue dated 1825: </p><p>"Pygmalion is proud o'er his cups to disclose, </p><p>Like a gem from Golconda my Twit at his nose; </p><p>Bacchus Hunt through the kingdom of Cockaigne is reckoned, </p><p>In his bright yellow breeches, the flower of my Second; </p><p>'Be the whole,' cries Kit North, 'to the winds flung away </p><p>When my clan of contributors rush to the fray.'" </p><p>To this precious charade course (the solution of which is, of course, "Scabbards") Professor Ferrier appends a note, which we quote, for the double reason that it will at once serve to give the reader a specimen of the editor's style of annotation, and to vindicate Wilson from the supposition that he would have been likely to sanction the resuscitation of these dead-and-gone personalities. The reader will perceive, too, that for certain persons who do not labour under what Professor Ferrier gravely calls "the disadvantage of being born on the south of the Tweed," it is still possible to see "wut" in the foregoing effusion. </p><p>"For 'twit' we should read 'first;' and so it was originally written. Twit was, perhaps, an accident of the press; perhaps a substitution by some pungent ally of Wilson's, who, having seen the proof, inserted the more pointed word. 'Pygmalion' was Hazlitt, who had published a book entitled, 'Liber Amoris; or, the New Pygmalion.' . . . Leigh Hunt, 'in his bright yellow breehes' a facetious (!!) allusion t his neither attire when a pupl of Christ's Hospital, London, where so many eminent men have been educated), was the translator of Redi's Bacchus in Tuscany." These personalities (biting enough, perhaps, at the time) were compensated at a later period by Christopher North, when, indignantly repudiating an offer made by some low hireling to run down Leigh Hunt and his London Journal, he exclaims, in words worthy of being written in letters of gold, 'THE ANIMOSITIES ARE MORTAL, BUT THE HUMANITIES LIVE FOR EVER.'" </p><p>Surely these words might have been taken by the editor not merely as a warrant, but an injunction, to expurgate the "Noctes," and reduce the four volumes to three. As to the general literary merit of these dialogues, we are unable to range ourselves with their enthusiastic admirers. Still, without bowing to Professor Ferrier's decision, that "in wisdom the Shepherd equals the Socrates of Plato, in humour he surpasses the Falstaff of Shakspeare," we may admit that the Shepherd is a vivid, spirited conception: he has always Johnson's sine qu  non "vigour in his talk;" often eloquence and poetry; in fact, whatever elements of Hogg he may have in him, he is evidently in the main Wilson himself, pouring out his thundering invcctive, his rollicking humour, and his deep sensibility to Nature, in Scotch more or less broad. Considered as dialogue, we cannot think the "Noctes" eminently successful. Tickler and North have scarcely any substantial interest, and do little more than serve to "trot out" the loquacious "James." The best passages are the Shepherd's descriptions of natural scenery and its effect on his feelings passages so numerous and charming, that we find it difficult to determine on quoting one and giving up all the rest, as our small space compels us to do. Here, however, is a description of some pictures which, to speak after the Shepherd's own fashion, we should like to have fasten'd against the wa' wi' a prin."</p><p>"Shepherd. I'm just as original in paintin as in poetry, and follow nae master!

Something like this embarrassing position of Adam's is the case of that unfortunate son of Adam, a reviewer who sits surrounded with books on which he is required there and then to render an opinion, for is not all opinion, nay, all science, simply a naming? Of the genus belles lettres, novels are usually the most numerous species, for assuredly they are fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth; but it so happens that this quarter they form no large proportion of the books before us. We give the precedence to a very unpretending one in a single volume of anything but close print. We mean, "A Lost Love,"6 by Ashford Owen. Take up this volume, not of course in the grave morning hours, when you want something strong and substantial, but when you come in agreeably tired with your walk, or, for want of conversation, between dinner and tea. You will find a </p><p>6 "A Lost Love." By Ashford Owen. London: Smith and Elder. </p><p>real picture of a woman's life; not a remarkable woman, not one of those heroines who have such amazing moral strength that they despise happiness and like to be disappointed, or who are so wonderfully intellectual as to give even serious views of "female competition;" yet not a commonplace woman, but one who, while loving and thirsting to be loved, give up her one hope in life when sympathy and good sense demand it, without having any fine theories about her deed, or any consciousness that she is doing something out of the common, one with no great culture and no great powers, but with that true freshness and simplicity which any mind original and interesting. Such is Georgy, the heroine of "A Lost Love;" a parasitic plant, but a vigorous one, with a strong preference of the particular tree to which it will cling. The story is a melancholy one, but without any exaggerated sorrows; the tragic notes in it belong to that "still, sad music of humanity," which seems to make hardly a perceptible element in the great world-symphony. But every tender and watchful nature has an ear for such notes; and Georgy's tale will remind most readers of something they have seen in life. The writing is not remarkable otherwise than for the excellent quality of simplicity: there are none of the fine sayings which often fall by the way from a superior writer, even when bent on merely telling a story; but in the absence of this merit, there is scarcely inferior merit of not aiming to say fine things. The author is unquestionably a woman, and writes likes one in the best sense, namely, by keeping to the delineation of what a woman's experience and observation bring within her special knowledge.</p><p>Quite an opposite kind of talent is exhibited in "Aspen Court,"7 which has been gathered into three volumes from the numbers of Bentley's Miscellany. Like all fiction written for periodical appearance, it bears the stamp of that demand for periodical effect, which opposes itself to natural development of character and incident; and so far "Aspen Court" is under a disadvantage when read consecutively. It belongs to the class of cleverly-written novels which are far as possible from boring us, but, having done their work of amusement, are laid down and forgotten. There is unusually smart writing and satirical sketching, but no grasp of character, no close, genuine presentation of life. It professes to be a story of our own day, and in one sense fulfils that profession, since its scenes are all selected as representative of various social aspects. We have a lawyer's office, a scene in the House of Commons, a club-house, high political society, a lock-up house, a fight, interviews with a manager, the reading of a play in the greenroom and its subsequent production on the stage, a hunt, a chop-house and the intrigues of a Catholic priest. But these scenes, one and all, are vitiated by the constant presence of unreality are always fantastic; and while locality and </p><p>often amusing, they costume imply that we are making acquaintance with the things and people of actual life, we are in fact among beings little less unreal than my Lord Marquis of </p><p>7 "Aspen Court. A Story of our own Time." By Shirley Brooks. London: Bentley. </p><p>Carabas. The great merit of the book is lively writing; witty sayings and humorous touches abound. For example: among the clerks in a lawyer's office is Mr. Maunder, who  </p><p>"wrote a beautiful hand, borrowed money from every new clerk, and was rather supposed to be an atheist, because he never swore, and because he had been detected reading Voltaire's Charles XII." "Mrs. Basnet, the monthly nurse, had annexed an embroidered pocket handkerchief from the drawers of a lady, who, at the time, was not nearly so well as could be expected." " The Countess of Rookbury, having presented the Earl with an heir, became dissatisfied with the Court physician, and called in hom opathist. Being thus left a widower, Lord Rookbury announced, to prevent trouble to the mothers of families for he was a very gentlemanly man that little Viscount Dawton was not to have a step-manima." " He found not . . . the meretricious cross-breed in art by which the modern French school contrives to depict the Magdalene with the united attractions of Palestine and the Palais Royal." </p><p>The great defect of "Aspen Court" is a want of earnestness as a back-ground to the liveliness; the author is never thoroughly serious even in the most serious situations. But the power of the writing and the change of scene carry one over the ground, and the book everywhere titillates the palate, though it satisfies no craving. </p><p>The Tales and Romances of Hendrik Conscience, the Flemish novelist, are appearing in a very attractive form as part of a series called "The Amusing Library." The high praise bestowed on these fictions in many quarters, led us to take them up with considerable expectation. The fact that the Belgian literature was born no longer since than 1830 was indeed no reason for anticipating anything very original or powerful even from one of its chief illustrations. It may be considered literature in its long clothes, very interesting to those immediately engaged in nursing it, but not likely to have more than mediocre attractions for the rest of the world. Still, it was a matter of curiosity to us to know what this infant literature seemed to promise, and from novelist, of all writers, we may look for something indigenous and characteristic. We are obliged to confess ourselves utterly disappointed, and even to admit that, with the two historical tales which have appeared "The Lion of Flander "8 and "Veva, or the War of the Peasants"9 we have been unable to persevere in our reading. With "The Curse of the Village, and the Happiness of being Rich,"10 we have been more successful; but these two have, in common with the historical tales, the fatal defect of being written in the spirit of the apologue, wherein the men and women speak and act in order to prove moral, or to rouse some sentiment in the reader, and not as a result of any natural combination of character with circumstance. It is amusing enough in these days, when Walter Scott is found fault with for not being "psychological" enough,</p><p>8 "The Lion of Flanders. An Historical Romance." By Hendrik Conscience. London: Lambert and Co. </p><p>9 "Veva; or the War of the Peasants." By Hendrik Conscience. London: Lambert and Co. </p><p>10 "The Curse of the Village, and the Happiness of Being Rich." Two Tales. By Hendrick Conscience. London: Lambert and Co. </p><p>to see extravagant praise lavished on these Flemish novels, the psychology of which is really not much above that of the moral fairy tale or the proselyting tract. "The Happiness of being Rich" has some humour in its conception, but the quiet under-current of humour," which is attributed to M. Conscience's style, has either evaporated in the translation, or is supplied by readers of more wealthy imagination than ourselves. The dialogue of the historical novels is especially stiff and stagy, reminding one of nothing so much as of modern five-act dramas. However, these Tales and Romances are certainly harmless, and the degree of reputation they have attained proves that they are a kind of material in demand among a large class of persons. </p><p>A new translation of Wilhelm Meister,11 which has appeared in Mr. Bohn's Standard Library, presents a further obstacle to the appreciation of Goethe by English readers. We say obstacle; for though the translation is tolerably executed so far as the prose is concerned, the rendering of the poetry is as atrocious a case of literary murder as we happen to have met with. Some of the most exquisite lyrics ever written in any language are turned into vulgar doggrel; and the perpetrator of this doggrel has not the grace even to offer an apology for it, so as to warn his readers that he cannot enable them to form the smallest conception of Goethe's poetry. "The Heptameron of Margaret, Queen of Navarre,"12 appears of course as an "extra volume," being one of those books which should be placed high up on the shelves, out of the reach of small hands. The historical bearing of these tales makes them valuable, but they are disappointing to those who come to them with a previous admiration for Margaret and a strong interest in her rather melancholy fortunes. Few readers in these days would agree with Montaigne's verdict on the Heptameron, that it is un gentil livre pour son  toffe; and the coarseness of the incidents is seldom relieved by that romance and poetry which charm us in Boccaocio. Margaret's flies are preserved in the smallest possible proportion of amber. Saint-Marc Girardin vindicates the morality of her purpose by referring to the edifying conversational comment which weaves her stories together; but to teach chastity by holding up pictures of unchastity is of all species of Helotism the most questionable. While we are on serial publications, let us mention the annotated pocket edition of Shakspeare's Poems,13 and the first volume of Hudibras,14 which have appeared in the series of English Poets, edited by Mr. Robert Bell. We have gone through the volume of Hudibras, and so can speak from experience of the thoroughness with which Mr. Bell has executed this part of his task.</p><p>Germany gives us this quarter two excellent books, not only on </p><p>11 "William Meister's Apprenticeship."

Parker and Son. </p><p>kindred subjects, but with the circumstantial resemblance of being the last works completed by their lately deceased authors. One of these books is "Odin,"15 by Wolfgang Menzel, whose historical works are well known through English translations. Menzel is admirable among German writers for his clear and business-like style; he makes straight for the point he has in view, dragging along no load of irrelevant ideas which oblige him to tack slowly from side to side. In the present volume we have an exhaustive monograph on Odin, which, however, without any departure from its main purpose, includes a large and varied field of mythological and legendary lore, told so agreeably and concisely, and with such ample reference to sources of further know ledge and comparison, that it is a real treasure to those who feel the attractions of the mystic and melancholy, but strong and terrible, Deutsche Saga. The single drawback to our pleasure in this volume is one of which we have so frequently to complain in German books the absence of any index, and even of any table of contents! We should like to engage all English critics whose voices can be heard in Germany, to remonstrate with every German writer who turns out elaborate works in this unmappcd state, which obliges you to plunge into them with as little idea where you shall find any particular thing, as if you were plunging into a virgin forest of America. This complaint is happily not to be made against the other work to which we have referred, namely, a second volume of "Bayerische Sagen und Br uche"16 (Bavarian Legends and Customs), by Friedrich Panzer. Here we have a table of contents and an ample index of words; both very needful, as the reader will conceive, when we tell him that this collection fills nearly 600 octavo pages, and consists of a mass of legends and particulars which it has required the labour of years to assemble. Curious matter for observation is the mode in which the Legend weaves into its fairy web the personages of the New Testament history. The Bavarian legend is rich in this kind of supplement to the Gospels. Peter is its favourite apostle, and is generally given as the companion of Jesus in his extra-biblical adventures. Here is a very n ive specimen: </p><p>"Christ and Peter passed through a place, where the carpenters were keeping holiday at the ale-house, with games and dancing. As it went so merrily here, Peter felt inclined to turn into the ale-house; but the Lord answered that it was no place for them; he would sit on the bench, however, and wait for Peter, if he liked to go in. As Peter turned to go in, the Lord fastened a fiddle on his back, and when he came among the carpenters, they cried, 'Fiddler, you must play us a tune!' Peter knew nothing of this fiddle, and as he did not obey them, they beat his fiddle to pieces a out his back. Peter returned to the Lord, complained of the rude carpenters, and asked, 'What shall we do to them?' 'I will make,' said the Lord, 'hard boughs on the trees! 'Iron boughs!' proposed Peter. 'Wooden will be hard enough,' answered the Lord. From this time forth there grew on the trees hard boughs, which the carpenters dread, because they make the hatchets full of notches."</p><p>15 "Odin." Von Wolfang Menzel.

The writer contends for the merit of the post-Goethean literature, and will by no means admit that since Goethe and Schiller, German genius has been lying fallow. </p><p>An excellent (untranslated) edition of the Pseudo-Shakspeare Dramas,"18 now being published in Germany, is worth mentioning, because no equally convenient and accessible edition exists in England.

CUMMING. </p><p>Given, a man with moderate intellect, a moral standard not higher than the average, some rhetorical affluence and great glibness of speech, what is the career in which, without the aid of birth or money, he may most easily attain power and reputation in English society? Where is that Goshen of mediocrity in which a smattering of science and learning will pass for profound instruction, where platitudes will be accepted as wisdom, bigoted narrowness as holy zeal, unctuous egoism as God-given piety? Let such a man become an evangelical preacher; he will then find it possible to reconcile small ability with great ambition, superficial knowledge with the prestige of erudition, a middling morale with a high reputation for sanctity. Let him shun practical extremes and be ultra only in what is purely theoretic; let him be stringent on predestination, but latitudinarian on fasting; unflinching in insisting on the Eternity of punishment, but diffident of curtailing the substantial comforts of Time; ardent and imaginative on the pro-millennial advent of Christ, but cold and cautious toward every other infringement of the status quo. Let him fish for souls not with the bait of inconvenient singularity, but with the drag-net of comfortable conformity. Let him be hard and literal in his interpretation only when he wants to hurl texts at the heads of unbelievers and adversaries, but when the letter of the Scriptures presses too closely on the genteel Christianity of the nineteenth century, let him use his spiritualizing alembic and disperse it into impalpable ether. Let him preach less of Christ than of Antichrist; let him be less definite in showing what sin is than in showing who is the Man of Sin, less expansive on the blessedness of faith than on the accursedness of infidelity. Above all, let him set up as an interpreter of prophecy, and rival Moore s Almanack in the prediction of political events, tickling the interest of hearers who are but moderately spiritual by showing how the Holy Spirit has dictated problems and charades for their benefit, and how, if they are ingenious enough to solve these, they may have their Christian graces nourished by learning precisely to whom they may point as the  horn that had eyes,  the lying prophet,  and the  unclean spirits.  In this way he will draw men to him by the strong cords of their passions, made reason-proof by being baptized with the name of piety. In this way he may gain a metropolitan pulpit; the avenues to his church will be as crowded as the passages to the opera; he has but to print his prophetic sermons and bind them in lilac and gold, and they will adorn the drawing-room table of all evangelical ladies, who will regard as a sort of pious  light reading  the demonstration that the prophecy of the locusts whose sting is in their tail, is fulfilled in the fact of the Turkish commander s having taken a horse s tail for his standard, and that the French are the very frogs predicted in the Revelations.</p><p>Pleasant to the clerical flesh under such circumstances is the arrival of Sunday! Somewhat at a disadvantage during the week, in the presence of working-day interests and lay splendors, on Sunday the preacher becomes the cynosure of a thousand eyes, and predominates at once over the Amphitryon with whom he dines, and the most captious member of his church or vestry. He has an immense advantage over all other public speakers. The platform orator is subject to the criticism of hisses and groans. Counsel for the plaintiff expects the retort of counsel for the defendant. The honorable gentleman on one side of the House is liable to have his facts and figures shown up by his honorable friend on the opposite side. Even the scientific or literary lecturer, if he is dull or incompetent, may see the best part of his audience quietly slip out one by one. But the preacher is completely master of the situation: no one may hiss, no one may depart. Like the writer of imaginary conversations, he may put what imbecilities he pleases into the mouths of his antagonists, and swell with triumph when he has refuted them. He may </p><p>riot in gratuitous assertions, confident that no man will contradict him; he may exercise perfect free-will in logic, and invent illustrative experience; he may give an evangelical edition of history with the inconvenient facts omitted: all this he may do with impunity, certain that those of his hearers who are not sympathizing are not listening. For the Press has no band of critics who go the round of the churches and chapels, and are on the watch for a slip or defect in the preacher, to make a  feature  in their article: the clergy are, practically, the most</p><p>irresponsible of all talkers. For this reason, at least, it is well that they do not always allow their discourses to be merely fugitive, but are often induced to fix them in that black and white in which they are open to the criticism of any man who has the courage and patience to treat them with thorough freedom of speech and pen. </p><p>It is because we think this criticism of clerical teaching desirable for the public good that we devote some pages to Dr. Cumming. He is, as every one knows, a preacher of immense popularity, and of the numerous publications in which he perpetuates his pulpit labors, all circulate widely, and some, according to their title-page, have reached the sixteenth thousand. Now our opinion of these publications is the very opposite of that given by a newspaper eulogist: we do not  believe that the repeated issues of Dr. Cumming s thoughts are having a beneficial effect on society,  but the reverse; and hence, little inclined as we are to dwell on his pages, we think it worth while to do so, for the sake of pointing out in them what we believe to be profoundly mistaken and pernicious. Of Dr. Cumming personally we know absolutely nothing: our acquaintance with him is confined to a perusal of his works, our judgment of him is founded solely on the manner in which he has written himself down on his pages. We know neither how he looks nor how he lives. We are ignorant whether, like St. Paul, he has a bodily presence that is weak and contemptible, or whether his person is as florid and as prone to amplification as his style. For aught we know, he may not only have the gift of prophecy, but may bestow the profits of all his works to feed the poor, and be ready to give his own body to be burned with as much alacrity as he infers the everlasting burning of Roman Catholics and Puseyites. Out of the pulpit he may be a model of justice, truthfulness, and the love that thinketh no evil; but we are obliged to judge of his charity by the spirit we find in his sermons, and shall only be glad to learn that his practice is, in many respects, an amiable non sequitur from his teaching.</p><p>Dr. Cumming s mind is evidently not of the pietistic order. There is not the slightest leaning toward mysticism in his Christianity no indication of religious raptures, of delight in God, of spiritual communion with the Father. He is most at home in the forensic view of Justification, and dwells on salvation as a scheme rather than as an experience. He insists on good works as the sign of justifying faith, as labors to be achieved to the glory of God, but he rarely represents them as the spontaneous, necessary outflow of a soul filled with Divine love. He is at home in the external, the polemical, the historical, the circumstantial, and is only episodically devout and practical. The great majority of his published sermons are occupied with argument or philippic against Romanists and unbelievers, with  vindications  of the Bible, with the political interpretation of prophecy, or the criticism of public events; and the devout aspiration, or the spiritual and practical exhortation, is tacked to them as a sort of fringe in a hurried sentence or two at the end. He revels in the demonstration that the Pope is the Man of Sin; he is copious on the downfall of the Ottoman empire; he appears to glow with satisfaction in turning a story which tends to show how he abashed an  infidel;  it is a favorite exercise with him to form conjectures of the process by which the earth is to be burned up, and to picture Dr. Chalmers and Mr. Wilberforce being caught up to meet Christ in the air, while Romanists, Puseyites, and infidels are given over to gnashing of teeth. But of really spiritual joys and sorrows, of the life and death of Christ as a manifestation of love that constrains the soul, of sympathy with that yearning over the lost and erring which made Jesus weep over Jerusalem, and prompted the sublime prayer,  Father, forgive them,  of the gentler fruits of the Spirit, and the peace of God which passeth understanding of all this, we find little trace in Dr. Cumming s discourses.</p><p>His style is in perfect correspondence with this habit of mind. Though diffuse, as that of all preachers must be, it has rapidity of movement, perfect clearness, and some aptness of illustration. He has much of that literary talent which makes a good journalist the power of beating out an idea over a large space, and of introducing far-fetched  propos. His writings have, indeed, no high merit: they have no originality or force of thought, no striking felicity of presentation, no depth of emotion. Throughout nine volumes we have alighted on no passage which impressed us as worth extracting, and placing among the  beauties,  of evangelical writers, such as Robert Hall, Foster the Essayist, or Isaac Taylor. Everywhere there is commonplace cleverness, nowhere a spark of rare thought, of lofty sentiment, or pathetic tenderness. We feel ourselves in company with a voluble retail talker, whose language is exuberant but not exact, and to whom we should never think of referring for precise information or for well-digested thought and experience. His argument continually slides into wholesale assertion and vague declamation, and in his love of ornament he frequently becomes tawdry. For example, he tells us ( Apoc. Sketches,  p. 265) that  Botany weaves around the cross her amaranthine garlands; and Newton comes from his starry home Linn us from his flowery resting-place and Werner and Hutton from their subterranean graves at the voice of Chalmers, to acknowledge that all they learned and elicited in their respective provinces has only served to show more clearly that Jesus of Nazareth is enthroned on the riches of the universe:  and so prosaic an injunction to his hearers as that they should choose a residence within an easy distance of church, is magnificently draped by him as an exhortation to prefer a house  that basks in the sunshine of the countenance of God.  Like all preachers of his class, he is more fertile in imaginative paraphrase than in close exposition, and in this way he gives us some remarkable fragments of what we may call the romance of Scripture, filling up the outline of the record with an elaborate coloring quite undreamed of by more literal minds. The serpent, he informs us, said to Eve,  Can it be so? Surely you are mistaken, that God hath said you shall die, a creature so fair, so lovely, so beautiful. It is impossible. The laws of nature and physical science tell you that my interpretation is correct; you shall not die. I can tell you by my own experience as an angel that you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  ( Apoc. Sketches,  p. 294.) Again, according to Dr. Cumming, Abel had so clear an idea of the Incarnation and Atonement, that when he offered his sacrifice  he must have said,  I feel myself a guilty sinner, and that in myself I cannot meet thee alive; I lay on thine altar this victim, and I shed its blood as my testimony that mine should be shed; and I look for forgiveness and undeserved mercy through him who is to bruise the serpent s head, and whose atonement this typifies.  ( Occas. Disc.  vol. i. p. 23.) Indeed, his productions are essentially ephemeral; he is essentially a journalist, who writes sermons instead of leading articles, who, instead of venting diatribes against her Majesty s Ministers, directs his power of invective against Cardinal Wiseman and the Puseyites; instead of declaiming on public spirit, perorates on the  glory of God.  We fancy he is called, in the more refined evangelical circles, an  intellectual preacher;  by the plainer sort of Christians, a  flowery preacher;  and we are inclined to think that the more spiritually minded class of believers, who look with greater anxiety for the kingdom of God within them than for the visible advent of Christ in 1864, will be likely to find Dr. Cumming s declamatory flights and historico-prophetical exercitations as little better than  clouts o  cauld parritch.</p><p>Such is our general impression from his writings after an attentive perusal. There are some particular characteristics which we shall consider more closely, but in doing so we must be understood as altogether declining any doctrinal discussion. We have no intention to consider the grounds of Dr. Cumming s dogmatic system, to examine the principles of his prophetic exegesis, or to question his opinion concerning the little horn, the river Euphrates, or the seven vials. We identify ourselves with no one of the bodies whom he regards it as his </p><p>special mission to attack: we give our adhesion neither to Romanism, Puseyism, nor to that anomalous combination of opinions which he introduces to us under the name of infidelity. It is simply as spectators that we criticise Dr. Cumming s mode of warfare, and we concern ourselves less with what he holds to be Christian truth than with his manner of enforcing that truth, less with the doctrines he teaches than with the moral spirit and tendencies of his teaching. </p><p>One of the most striking characteristics of Dr. Cumming s writings is unscrupulosity of statement. His motto apparently is, Christianitatem, quocunque modo, Christianitatem; and the only </p><p>system he includes under the term Christianity is Calvinistic Protestantism. Experience has so long shown that the human brain is a congenial nidus for inconsistent beliefs that we do not pause to inquire how Dr. Cumming, who attributes the conversion of the unbelieving to the Divine Spirit, can think it necessary to co-operate with that Spirit by argumentative white lies. Nor do we for a moment impugn the genuineness of his zeal for Christianity, or the sincerity of his conviction that the doctrines he preaches are necessary to salvation; on the contrary, we </p><p>regard the flagrant unveracity that we find on his pages as an indirect result of that conviction as a result, namely, of the intellectual and moral distortion of view which is inevitably produced by assigning to dogmas, based on a very complex structure of evidence, the place and authority of first truths. A distinct appreciation of the value of evidence in other words, the intellectual perception of truth is more closely allied to truthfulness of statement, or the moral quality of veracity, than is generally admitted. There is not a more pernicious fallacy afloat, in common parlance, than the wide distinction made between intellect and morality. Amiable impulses without intellect, man may have in common with dogs and horses; but morality, which is specifically human, is dependent on the regulation of feeling by intellect. All human beings who can be said to be in any degree moral have their impulses guided, not indeed always by their own intellect, but by the intellect of human beings who have gone before them, and created traditions and associations which have taken the rank of laws. Now that highest moral habit, the constant preference of truth, both theoretically and practically, pre-eminently demands the co-operation of the intellect with the impulses, as is indicated by the fact that it is only found in anything like completeness in the highest class of minds. In accordance with this we think it is found that, in proportion as religious sects exalt feeling above intellect, and believe themselves to be guided by direct inspiration rather than by a spontaneous exertion of their faculties that is, in proportion as they are removed from rationalism their sense of truthfulness is misty and confused. No one can have talked to the more enthusiastic Methodists and listened to their stories of miracles without perceiving that they require no other passport to a statement than that it accords with their wishes and their general conception of God s dealings; nay, they regard as a symptom of sinful scepticism an inquiry into the evidence for a story which they think unquestionably tends to the glory of God, and in retailing such stories, new particulars, further tending to his glory, are  borne in  upon their minds. Now, Dr. Cumming, as we have said, is no enthusiastic pietist: within a certain circle within the mill of evangelical orthodoxy his intellect is perpetually at work; but that principle of sophistication which our friends the Methodists derive from the predominance of their pietistic feelings, is involved for him in the doctrine of verbal inspiration; what is for them a state of emotion submerging the intellect, is with him a formula imprisoning the intellect, depriving it of its proper function the free search for truth and making it the mere servant-of-all-work to a foregone conclusion. Minds fettered by this doctrine no longer inquire concerning a proposition whether it is attested by sufficient evidence, but whether it accords with Scripture; they do not search for facts, as such, but for facts that will bear out their doctrine. They become accustomed to reject the more direct evidence in favor of the less direct, and where adverse evidence reaches demonstration they must resort to devices and expedients in order to explain away contradiction. It is easy to see that this mental habit blunts not only the perception of truth, but the sense of truthfulness, and that the man whose faith drives him into fallacies treads close upon the precipice of falsehood.</p><p>We have entered into this digression for the sake of mitigating the inference that is likely to be drawn from that characteristic of Dr. Cumming s works to which we have pointed. He is much in the same intellectual condition as that professor of Padua; who, in order to disprove Galileo s discovery of Jupiter s satellites, urged that as there were only seven metals there could not be more than seven planets a mental condition scarcely compatible with candor. And we may well suppose that if the professor had held the belief in seven planets, and no more, to be a necessary condition of salvation, his mental condition would have been so dazed that even if he had consented to look through Galileo s telescope, his eyes would have reported in accordance with his inward alarms rather than with the external fact. So long as a belief in propositions is regarded as indispensable to salvation, the pursuit of truth as such is not possible, any more than it is possible for a man who is swimming for his life to make meteorological observations on the storm which threatens to overwhelm him. The sense of alarm and haste, the anxiety for personal safety, which Dr. Cumming insists upon as the proper religious attitude, unmans the nature, and allows no thorough, calm thinking no truly noble, disinterested feeling. Hence, we by no means suspect that the unscrupulosity of statement with which we charge Dr. Cumming, extends beyond the sphere of his theological prejudices; we do not doubt that, religion apart, he appreciates and practices veracity. </p><p>A grave general accusation must be supported by details, and in adducing those we purposely select the most obvious cases of misrepresentation such as require no argument to expose them, but can be perceived at a glance. Among Dr. Cumming s numerous books, one of the most notable for unscrupulosity of statement is the  Manual of Christian Evidences,  written, as he tells us in his Preface, not to give the deepest solutions of the difficulties in question, but to furnish Scripture Readers, City Missionaries, and Sunday School Teachers, with a  ready reply  to sceptical arguments. This announcement that readiness was the chief quality sought for in the solutions here given, modifies our inference from the other qualities which those solutions present; and it is but fair to presume that when the Christian disputant is not in a hurry Dr. Cumming would recommend replies less ready and more veracious. Here is an example of what in another place {74} he tells his readers is  change in their pocket . . . a little ready argument which they can employ, and therewith answer a fool according to his folly.  From the nature of this argumentative small coin, we are inclined to think Dr. Cumming understands answering a fool according to his folly to mean, giving him a foolish answer. We quote from the  Manual of Christian Evidences,  p. 62.</p><p> Some of the gods which the heathen worshipped were among the greatest monsters that ever walked the earth. Mercury was a thief; and because he was an expert thief he was enrolled among the gods. Bacchus was a mere sensualist and drunkard, and therefore he was enrolled among the gods. Venus was a dissipated and abandoned courtesan, and therefore she was enrolled among the goddesses. Mars was a savage, that gloried in battle and in blood, and therefore he was deified and enrolled among the gods.</p><p>Does Dr. Cumming believe the purport of these sentences? If so, this passage is worth handing down as his theory of the Greek myth as a specimen of the astounding ignorance which was possible in a metropolitan preacher, A.D. 1854. And if he does not believe them . . . The inference must then be, that he thinks delicate veracity about the ancient Greeks is not a Christian virtue, but only a  splendid sin  of the unregenerate. This inference is rendered the more probable by our finding, a little further on, that he is not more scrupulous about the moderns, if they come under his definition of  Infidels.  But the passage we are about to quote in proof of this has a worse quality than its discrepancy with fact. Who that has a spark of generous feeling, that rejoices in the presence of good in a fellow-being, has not dwelt with pleasure on the thought that Lord Byron s unhappy career was ennobled and purified toward its close by a high and sympathetic purpose, by honest and energetic efforts for his fellow-men? Who has not read with deep emotion those last pathetic lines, beautiful as the after-glow of sunset, in which love and resignation are mingled with something of a melancholy heroism? Who has not lingered with compassion over the dying scene at Missolonghi the sufferer s inability to make his farewell messages of love intelligible, and the last long hours of silent pain? Yet for the sake of furnishing his disciples with a  ready reply,  Dr. Cumming can prevail on himself to inoculate them with a bad-spirited falsity like the following:</p><p> We have one striking exhibition of an infidel s brightest thoughts, in some lines written in his dying moments by a man, gifted with great genius, capable of prodigious intellectual prowess, but of worthless principle, and yet more worthless practices I mean the celebrated Lord Byron. He says:</p><p> Though gay companions o er the bowl</p><p>Dispel awhile the sense of ill, </p><p>Though pleasure fills the maddening soul, </p><p>The heart the heart is lonely still. </p><p> Ay, but to die, and go, alas!</p><p>Where all have gone and all must go; </p><p>To be the Nothing that I was, </p><p>Ere born to life and living woe! </p><p> Count o er the joys thine hours have seen,</p><p>Count o er thy days from anguish free, </p><p>And know, whatever thou hast been, </p><p>Tis something better not to be. </p><p> Nay, for myself, so dark my fate</p><p>Through every turn of life hath been, </p><p>Man and the world so much I hate, </p><p>I care not when I quit the scene.  </p><p>It is difficult to suppose that Dr. Cumming can have been so grossly imposed upon that he can be so ill-informed as really to believe that these lines were  written  by Lord Byron in his dying moments; but, allowing him the full benefit of that possibility, how shall we explain his introduction of this feebly rabid doggrel as  an infidel s brightest thoughts?</p><p>In marshalling the evidences of Christianity, Dr. Cumming directs most of his arguments against opinions that are either totally imaginary, or that belong to the past rather than to the present, while he entirely fails to meet the difficulties actually felt and urged by those who are unable to accept Revelation. There can hardly be a stronger proof of misconception as to the character of free-thinking in the present day, than the recommendation of Leland s  Short and Easy Method with the Deists  a method which is unquestionably short and easy for preachers disinclined to reconsider their stereotyped modes of thinking and arguing, but which has quite ceased to realize those epithets in the conversion of Deists. Yet Dr. Cumming not only recommends this book, but takes the trouble himself to write a feebler version of its arguments. For example, on the question of the genuineness and authenticity of the New Testament writing s, he says:  If, therefore, at a period long subsequent to the death of Christ, a number of men had appeared in the world, drawn up a book which they christened by the name of the Holy Scripture, and recorded these things which appear in it as facts when they were only the fancies of their own imagination, surely the Jews would have instantly reclaimed that no such events transpired, that no such person as Jesus Christ appeared in their capital, and that their crucifixion of Him, and their alleged evil treatment of his apostles, were mere fictions.</p><p>{76} It is scarcely necessary to say that, in such argument as this, Dr. Cumming is beating the air. He is meeting a hypothesis which no one holds, and totally missing the real question. The only type of  infidel  whose existence Dr. Cumming recognizes is that fossil personage who  calls the Bible a lie and a forgery.  He seems to be ignorant or he chooses to ignore the fact that there is a large body of eminently instructed and earnest men who regard the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures as a series of historical documents, to be dealt with according to the</p><p>rules of historical criticism, and that an equally large number of men, who are not historical critics, find the dogmatic scheme built on the letter of the Scriptures opposed to their profoundest moral convictions. Dr. Cumming s infidel is a man who, because his life is vicious, tries to convince himself that there is no God, and that Christianity is an imposture, but who is all the while secretly conscious that he is opposing the truth, and cannot help  letting out  admissions  that the Bible is the Book of God.  We are favored with the following  Creed of the Infidel:</p><p> I believe that there is no God, but that matter is God, and God is matter; and that it is no matter whether there is any God or not. I believe also that the world was not made, but that the world made itself, or that it had no beginning, and that it will last forever. I believe that man is a beast; that the soul is the body, and that the body is the soul; and that after death there is neither body nor soul. I believe there is no religion, that natural religion is the only religion, and all religion unnatural. I believe not in Moses; I believe in the first philosophers. I believe not in the evangelists; I believe in Chubb, Collins, Toland, Tindal, and Hobbes. I believe in Lord Bolingbroke, and I believe not in St. Paul. I believe not in revelation; I believe in tradition; I believe in the Talmud; I believe in the Koran; I believe not in the Bible. I believe in Socrates; I believe in Confucius; I believe in Mahomet; I believe not in Christ. And lastly, I believe in all unbelief.</p><p>The intellectual and moral monster whose creed is this complex web of contradictions, is, moreover, according to Dr. Cumming, a being who unites much simplicity and imbecility with his Satanic hardihood much tenderness of conscience with his obdurate vice. Hear the  proof:</p><p> I once met with an acute and enlightened infidel, with whom I reasoned day after day, and for hours together; I submitted to him the internal, the external, and the experimental evidences, but made no impression on his scorn and unbelief. At length I entertained a suspicion that there was something morally, rather than intellectually wrong, and that the bias was not in the intellect, but in the heart; one day therefore I said to him,  I must now state my conviction, and you may call me uncharitable, but duty compels me; you are living in some known and gross sin.  The man s countenance became pale; he bowed and left me.  Man. of Evidences,  p. 254.</p><p>Here we have the remarkable psychological phenomenon of an  acute and enlightened  man who, deliberately purposing to indulge in a favorite sin, and regarding the Gospel with scorn and unbelief, is, nevertheless, so much more scrupulous than the majority of Christians, that he cannot  embrace sin and the Gospel simultaneously;  who is so alarmed at the Gospel in which he does not believe, that he cannot be easy without trying to crush it; whose acuteness and enlightenment suggest to him, as a means of crushing the Gospel, to argue from day to day with Dr.</p><p>Cumming; and who is withal so na ve that he is taken by surprise when Dr. Cumming, failing in argument, resorts to accusation, and so tender in conscience that, at the mention of his sin, he turns pale and leaves the spot. If there be any human mind in existence capable of holding Dr. Cumming s  Creed of the Infidel,  of at the same time believing in tradition and  believing in all unbelief,  it must be the mind of the infidel just described, for whose existence we have Dr. Cumming s ex officio word as a theologian; and to theologians we may apply what Sancho Panza says of the bachelors of Salamanca, that they never tell lies except when it suits their purpose.</p><p>The total absence from Dr. Cumming s theological mind of any demarcation between fact and rhetoric is exhibited in another passage, where he adopts the dramatic form: </p><p> Ask the peasant on the hills and I have asked amid the mountains of Braemar and Deeside  How do you know that this book is divine, and that the religion you profess is true? You never read Paley?  No, I never heard of him.  You have never read Butler?  No, I have never heard of him.  Nor Chalmers?  No, I do not know him.  You have never read any books on evidence?  No, I have read no such books.  Then, how do you know this book is true?  Know it! Tell me that the Dee, the Clunie, and the Garrawalt, the streams at my feet, do not run; that the winds do not sigh amid the gorges of these blue hills; that the sun does not kindle the peaks of Loch-na-Gar; tell me my heart does not beat, and I will believe you; but do not tell me the Bible is not divine. I have found its truth illuminating my footsteps; its consolations sustaining my heart. May my tongue cleave to my mouth s roof and my right hand forget its cunning, if I every deny what is my deepest inner experience, that this blessed book is the book of God.  Church Before the Flood,  p. 35.</p><p>Dr. Cumming is so slippery and lax in his mode of presentation that we find it impossible to gather whether he means to assert that this is what a peasant on the mountains of Braemar did say, or that it is what such a peasant would say: in the one case, the passage may be taken as a measure of his truthfulness; in the other, of his judgment.</p><p>His own faith, apparently, has not been altogether intuitive, like that of his rhetorical peasant, for he tells us ( Apoc. Sketches,  p. 405) that he has himself experienced what it is to have religious doubts.  I was tainted while at the University by this spirit of scepticism. I thought Christianity might not be true. The very possibility of its being true was the thought I felt I must meet and settle. Conscience could give me no peace till I had settled it. I read, and I read from that day, for fourteen or fifteen years, till this, and now I am as convinced, upon the clearest evidence, that this book is the book of God as that I now address you.  This experience, however, instead of impressing on him the fact that doubt may be the stamp of a truth-loving mind that sunt quibus non credidisse honor est, et fidei futur  pignus seems to have produced precisely the contrary effect. It has not enabled him even to conceive the condition of a mind  perplext in faith but pure in deeds,  craving light, yearning for a faith that will harmonize and cherish its highest powers and aspirations, but unable to find that faith in dogmatic Christianity. His own doubts apparently were of a different kind. Nowhere in his pages have we found a humble, candid, sympathetic attempt to meet the difficulties that may be felt by an ingenuous mind. Everywhere he supposes that the doubter is hardened, conceited, consciously shutting his eyes to the light a fool who is to be answered according to his folly that is, with ready replies made up of reckless assertions, of apocryphal anecdotes, and, where other resources fail, of vituperative imputation. As to the reading which he has</p><p>prosecuted for fifteen years either it has left him totally ignorant of the relation which his own religions creed bears to the criticism and philosophy of the nineteenth century, or he systematically blinks that criticism and that philosophy; and instead of honestly and seriously endeavoring to meet and solve what he knows to be the real difficulties, contents himself with setting up popinjays to shoot at, for the sake of confirming the ignorance and winning the heap admiration of his evangelical hearers and readers. Like the Catholic preacher who, after throwing down his cap and apostrophizing it as Luther, turned to his audience and said,  You see this heretical fellow has not a word to say for himself,  Dr. Cumming, having drawn his ugly portrait of the infidel, and put arguments of a convenient quality into his mouth, finds a  short</p><p>and easy method  of confounding this  croaking frog.</p><p>In his treatment of infidels, we imagine he is guided by a mental process which may be expressed in the following syllogism: Whatever tends to the glory of God is true; it is for the glory of God that infidels should be as bad as possible; therefore, whatever tends to show that infidels are as bad as possible is true. All infidels, he tells us, have been men of  gross and licentious lives.  Is there not some well-known unbeliever, David Hume, for example, of whom even Dr. Cumming s readers may have heard as an exception? No matter. Some one suspected that he was not an exception, and as that suspicion tends to the glory of God, it is one for a Christian to entertain. (See  Man. of Ev.,  p. 73.) If we were unable to imagine this kind of self-sophistication, we should be obliged to suppose that, relying on the ignorance of his evangelical disciples, he fed them with direct and conscious falsehoods.  Voltaire,  he informs them,  declares there is no God;  he was  an antitheist, that is one who deliberately and avowedly opposed and hated God; who swore in his blasphemy that he would dethrone him;  and  advocated the very depths of the lowest sensuality.  With regard to many statements of a similar kind, equally at variance with truth, in Dr. Cumming s volumes, we presume that he has been misled by hearsay or by the second-hand character of his acquaintance with free-thinking literature. An evangelical preacher is not obliged to be well-read. Here, however, is a case which the extremest supposition of educated ignorance will not reach. Even books of  evidences  quote from Voltaire the line</p><p> Si Dieu n existait pas, il faudrait l inventer;</p><p>even persons fed on the mere whey and buttermilk of literature must know that in philosophy Voltaire was nothing if not a theist must know that he wrote not against God, but against Jehovah, the God of the Jews, whom he believed to be a false God must know that to say Voltaire was an atheist on this ground is as absurd as to say that a Jacobite opposed hereditary monarchy because he declared the Brunswick family had no title to the throne. That Dr. Cumming should repeat the vulgar fables about Voltaire s death is merely what we might expect from the specimens we have seen of his illustrative stories. A man whose accounts of his own experience are apocryphal is not likely to put borrowed narratives to any severe test. </p><p>The alliance between intellectual and moral perversion is strikingly typified by the way in which he alternates from the unveracious to the absurd, from misrepresentation to contradiction. Side by side with the abduction of  facts  such as those we have quoted, we find him arguing on one page that the Trinity was too grand a doctrine to have been conceived by man, and was therefore Divine; and on another page, that the Incarnation had been preconceived by man, and is therefore to be accepted as Divine. But we are less concerned with the fallacy of his  ready replies  than with their falsity; and even of this we can only afford space for a very few specimens. Here is one:  There is a thousand times more proof that the gospel of John was written by him than there is that the A??????? was written by Xenophon, or the Ars Poetica by Horace.  If Dr. Cumming had chosen Plato s Epistles or Anacreon s Poems instead of the Anabasis or the Ars Poetica, he would have reduced the extent of the falsehood, and would have furnished a ready reply which would have been equally effective with his Sunday-school teachers and their disputants. Hence we conclude this prodigality of misstatement, this exuberance of mendacity, is an effervescence of zeal in majorem gloriam Dei. Elsewhere he tells us that  the idea of the author of the  Vestiges  is, that man is the</p><p>development of a monkey, that the monkey is the embryo man, so that if you keep a baboon long enough, it will develop itself into a man.  How well Dr. Cumming has qualified himself to judge of the ideas in  that very unphilosophical book,  as he pronounces it, may be inferred from the fact that he implies the author of the  Vestiges  to have originated the nebular hypothesis.</p><p>In the volume from which the last extract is taken, even the hardihood of assertion is surpassed by the suicidal character of the argument. It is called  The Church before the Flood,  and is devoted chiefly to the adjustment of the question between the Bible and Geology. Keeping within the limits we have prescribed to ourselves, we do not enter into the matter of this discussion; we merely pause a little over the volume in order to point out Dr. Cumming s mode of treating the question. He first tells us that  the Bible has not a single scientific error in it;  that  its slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true,  and he asks:</p><p> How is it that Moses, with no greater education than the Hindoo or the ancient philosopher, has written his book, touching science at a thousand points, so accurately that scientific research has discovered no flaws in it; and yet in those investigations which have taken place in more recent centuries, it has not been shown that he has committed one single error, or made one solitary assertion which can be proved by the maturest science, or by the most eagle-eyed philosopher, to be incorrect, scientifically or historically?</p><p>According to this the relation of the Bible to science should be one of the strong points of apologists for revelation: the scientific accuracy of Moses should stand at the head of their evidences; and they might urge with some cogency, that since Aristotle, who devoted himself to science, and lived many ages after Moses, does little else than err ingeniously, this fact, that the Jewish Lawgiver, though touching science at a thousand points, has written nothing that has not been  demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true,  is an irrefragable proof of his having derived his knowledge from a supernatural source. How does it happen, then, that Dr. Cumming forsakes this strong position? How is it that we find him, some pages further on, engaged in reconciling Genesis with the discoveries of science, by means of imaginative hypotheses and feats of  interpretation?  Surely, that which has been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true does not require hypothesis and critical argument, in order to show that it may possibly agree with those very discoveries by means of which its exact and strict truth has been demonstrated. And why should Dr. Cumming suppose, as we shall presently find him supposing, that men of science hesitate to accept the Bible, because it appears to contradict their discoveries? By his own statement, that appearance of contradiction does not exist; on the contrary, it has been demonstrated that the Bible precisely agrees with their discoveries. Perhaps, however, in saying of the Bible that its  slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true,  Dr. Cumming merely means to imply that theologians have found out a way of explaining the biblical text so that it no longer, in their opinion, appears to be in contradiction with the discoveries of science. One of two things, therefore: either he uses language without the slightest appreciation of its real meaning, or the assertions he makes on one page are directly contradicted by the arguments he urges on another.</p><p>Dr. Cumming s principles or, we should rather say, confused notions of biblical interpretation, as exhibited in this volume, are particularly significant of his mental calibre. He says ( Church before the Flood,  p. 93):  Men of science, who are full of scientific investigation and enamored of scientific discovery, will hesitate before they accept a book which, they think, contradicts the plainest and the most unequivocal disclosures they have made in the bowels of the earth, or among the stars of the sky. To all these we answer, as we have already indicated, there is not the least dissonance between God s written book and the most mature discoveries of geological science. One thing, however, there may be: there may be a contradiction between the discoveries of geology and our preconceived interpretations of the Bible. But this is not because the Bible is wrong, but because our interpretation is wrong.  (The italics in all cases are our own.)</p><p>Elsewhere he says:  It seems to me plainly evident that the record of Genesis, when read fairly, and not in the light of our prejudices and mind you, the essence of Popery is to read the Bible in the light of our opinions, instead of viewing our opinions in the light of the Bible, in its plain and obvious sense falls in perfectly with the</p><p>assertion of geologists. </p><p>On comparing these two passages, we gather that when Dr. Cumming, under stress of geological discovery, assigns to the biblical text a meaning entirely different from that which, on his own showing, was universally ascribed to it for more than three thousand years, he regards himself as  viewing his opinions in the light of the Bible in its plain and obvious sense!  Now he is reduced to one of two alternatives: either he must hold that the  plain and obvious meaning  of the whole Bible differs from age to age, so that the criterion of its meaning lies in the sum of knowledge possessed by each successive age the Bible being an elastic garment for the growing thought of mankind; or he must hold that some portions are amenable to this criterion, and others not so. In the former case, he accepts the principle of interpretation adopted by the early German rationalists; in the latter case he has to show a further criterion by which we can judge what parts of the Bible are elastic and what rigid. If he says that the interpretation of the text is rigid wherever it treats of doctrines necessary to salvation, we answer, that for doctrines to be necessary to salvation they must first be true; and in order to be true, according to his own principle, they must be founded on a correct interpretation of the biblical text. Thus he makes the necessity of doctrines to salvation the criterion of infallible interpretation, and infallible interpretation the criterion of doctrines being necessary to salvation. He is whirled round in a circle, having, by admitting the principle of novelty in interpretation, completely deprived himself of a basis. That he should seize the very moment in which he is most palpably betraying that he has no test of biblical truth beyond his own opinion, as an appropriate occasion for flinging the rather novel reproach against Popery that its essence is to  read the Bible in the light of our opinions,  would be an almost pathetic self-exposure, if it were not disgusting. Imbecility that is not even meek, ceases to be pitiable, and becomes simply odious.</p><p>Parenthetic lashes of this kind against Popery are very frequent with Dr. Cumming, and occur even in his more devout passages, where their introduction must surely disturb the spiritual exercises of his hearers. Indeed, Roman Catholics fare worse with him even than infidels. Infidels are the small vermin the mice to be bagged en passant. The main object of his chase the rats which are to be nailed up as trophies are the Roman Catholics. Romanism is the masterpiece of Satan; but reassure yourselves! Dr. Cumming has been created. Antichrist is enthroned in the Vatican; but he is stoutly withstood by the Boanerges of Crown-court. The personality of Satan, as might be expected, is a very prominent tenet in Dr. Cumming s discourses; those who doubt it are, he thinks,  generally specimens of the victims of Satan as a triumphant seducer;  and it is through the medium of this doctrine that he habitually contemplates Roman Catholics. They are the puppets of which the devil holds the strings. It is only exceptionally that he speaks of them as fellow-men, acted on by the same desires, fears, and hopes as himself; his rule is to hold them up to his hearers as foredoomed instruments of Satan and vessels of wrath. If he is obliged to admit that they are  no shams,  that they are  thoroughly in earnest  that is because they are inspired by hell, because they are under an  infra-natural  influence. If their missionaries are found wherever Protestant missionaries go, this zeal in propagating their faith is not in them a consistent virtue, as it is in Protestants, but a  melancholy fact,  affording additional evidence that they are instigated and assisted by the devil. And Dr. Cumming is</p><p>inclined to think that they work miracles, because that is no more than might be expected from the known ability of Satan who inspires them. {86a} He admits, indeed, that  there is a fragment of the Church of Christ in the very bosom of that awful apostasy,  {86b} and that there are members of the Church of Rome in glory; but this admission is rare and episodical is a declaration, pro form , about as influential on the general disposition and habits as an aristocrat s profession of democracy.</p><p>This leads us to mention another conspicuous characteristic of Dr. Cumming s teaching the absence of genuine charity. It is true that he makes large profession of tolerance and liberality within a certain circle; he exhorts Christians to unity; he would have Churchmen fraternize with Dissenters, and exhorts these two branches of God s family to defer the settlement of their differences till the millennium. But the love thus taught is the love of the clan, which is the correlative of antagonism to the rest of mankind. It is not sympathy and helpfulness toward men as men, but toward men as Christians, and as Christians in the sense of a small minority. Dr. Cumming s religion may demand a tribute of love, but it gives a charter to hatred; it may enjoin charity, but it fosters all uncharitableness. If I believe that God tells me to love my enemies, but at the same time hates His own enemies and requires me to have one will with Him, which has the larger scope, love or hatred? And we refer to those pages of Dr. Cumming s in which he opposes Roman Catholics, Puseyites, and infidels pages which form the larger proportion of what he has published for proof that the idea of God which both the logic and spirit of his discourses keep present to his hearers, is that of a God who hates his enemies, a God who teaches love by fierce denunciations of wrath a God who encourages obedience to his precepts by elaborately revealing to us that his own government is in precise opposition to those precepts. We know the usual evasions on this subject. We know Dr. Cumming would say that even Roman Catholics are to be loved and succored as men; that he would help even that  unclean spirit,  Cardinal Wiseman, out of a ditch. But who that is in the slightest degree acquainted with the action of the human mind will believe that any genuine and large charity can grow out of an exercise of love which is always to have an arri re-pens e of hatred? Of what quality would be the conjugal love of a husband who loved his spouse as a wife, but hated her as a woman? It is reserved for the regenerate mind, according to Dr. Cumming s conception of it, to be  wise, amazed, temperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment.  Precepts of charity uttered with a faint breath at the end of a sermon are perfectly futile, when all the force of the lungs has been spent in keeping the hearer s mind fixed on the conception of his fellow-men not as fellow-sinners and fellow-sufferers, but as agents of hell, as automata through whom Satan plays his game upon earth not on objects which call forth their reverence, their love, their hope of good even in the most strayed and perverted, but on a minute identification of human things with such symbols as the scarlet whore, the beast out of the abyss, scorpions whose sting is in their tails, men who have the mark of the beast, and unclean spirits like frogs. You might as well attempt to educate the child s sense of beauty by hanging its nursery with the horrible and grotesque pictures in which the early painters represented the Last Judgment, as expect Christian graces to flourish on that prophetic interpretation which Dr. Cumming offers as the principal nutriment of his flock. Quite apart from the critical basis of that interpretation, quite apart from the degree of truth there may be in Dr. Cumming s prognostications questions into which we do not choose to enter his use of prophecy must be  priori condemned in the judgment of right-minded persons, by its results as testified in the net moral effect of his sermons. The best minds that accept Christianity as a divinely inspired system, believe that the great end of the Gospel is not merely the saving but the educating of men s souls, the creating within them of holy dispositions, the subduing of egoistical pretensions, and the perpetual enhancing of the desire that the will of God a will synonymous with goodness and truth may be done on earth. But what relation to all this has a system of interpretation which keeps the mind of the Christian in the position of a spectator at a gladiatorial show, of which Satan is the wild beast in the shape of the great red dragon, and two thirds of mankind the victims the whole provided and got up by God for the edification of the saints? The demonstration that the Second Advent is at hand, if true, can have no really holy, spiritual effect; the highest state of mind inculcated by the Gospel is resignation to the disposal of God s providence  Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; whether we die, we die unto the Lord  not an eagerness to see a temporal manifestation which shall confound the enemies of God and give exaltation to the saints; it is to dwell in Christ by spiritual communion with his nature, not to fix the date when He shall appear in the sky. Dr. Cumming s delight in shadowing forth the downfall of the Man of Sin, in prognosticating the battle of Gog and Magog, and in advertising the pre-millennial Advent, is simply the transportation of political passions on to a so-called religious platform; it is the anticipation of the triumph of  our party,  accomplished by our principal men being  sent for  into the clouds. Let us be understood to speak in all seriousness. If we were in search of amusement, we should not seek for it by examining Dr. Cumming s works in order to ridicule them. We are simply discharging a disagreeable duty in delivering our opinion that, judged by the highest standard even of orthodox Christianity, they are little calculated to produce</p><p> A closer walk with God,</p><p>A calm and heavenly frame; </p><p>but are more likely to nourish egoistic complacency and pretension, a hard and condemnatory spirit toward one s fellow-men, and a busy occupation with the minuti  of events, instead of a reverent contemplation of great facts and a wise application of great principles. It would be idle to consider Dr. Cumming s theory of prophecy in any</p><p>other light; as a philosophy of history or a specimen of biblical interpretation, it bears about the same relation to the extension of genuine knowledge as the astrological  house  in the heavens bears to the true structure and relations of the universe.</p><p>The slight degree in which Dr. Cumming s faith is imbued with truly human sympathies is exhibited in the way he treats the doctrine of Eternal Punishment. Here a little of that readiness to strain the letter of the Scriptures which he so often manifests when his object is to prove a point against Romanism, would have been an amiable frailty if it had been applied on the side of mercy. When he is bent on proving that the prophecy concerning the Man of Sin, in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, refers to the Pope, he can extort from the innocent word k?????? the meaning cathedrize, though why we are to translate  He as God cathedrizes in the temple of God,  any more than we are to translate  cathedrize here, while I go and pray yonder,  it is for Dr. Cumming to show more clearly than he has yet done. But when rigorous literality will favor the conclusion that the greater proportion of the human race will be eternally miserable then he is rigorously literal.</p><p>He says:  The Greek words, e??, t??? a???a? t?? a?????, here translated  everlasting,  signify literally  unto the ages of ages,  a?e? ??,  always being,  that is, everlasting, ceaseless existence. Plato uses the word in this sense when he says,  The gods that live forever.  But I must also admit that this word is used several times in a limited extent as for instance,  The everlasting hills.  Of course this does not mean that there never will be a time when the hills will cease to stand; the expression here is evidently figurative, but it implies eternity. The hills shall remain as long as the earth lasts, and no hand has power to remove them but that Eternal One which first called them into being; so the state of the soul remains the same after death as long as the soul exists, and no one has power to alter it. The same word is often applied to denote the existence of God  the Eternal God.  Can we limit the word when applied to him? Because occasionally used in a limited sense, we must not infer it is always so.  Everlasting  plainly means in Scripture  without end;  it is only to be explained figuratively when it is evident it cannot be interpreted in any other way.</p><p>We do not discuss whether Dr. Cumming s interpretation accords with the meaning of the New Testament writers: we simply point to the fact that the text becomes elastic for him when he wants freer play for his prejudices, while he makes it an adamantine barrier against the admission that mercy will ultimately triumph that God, i.e., Love, will be all in all. He assures us that he does not  delight to dwell on the misery of the lost:  and we believe him. That misery does not seem to be a question of feeling with him, either one way or the other. He does not merely resign himself to the awful mystery of eternal punishment; he contends for it. Do we object, he asks, {90} to everlasting happiness? then why object to everlasting misery? reasoning which is perhaps felt to be cogent by theologians who anticipate the everlasting happiness for</p><p>themselves, and the everlasting misery for their neighbors.</p><p>The compassion of some Christians has been glad to take refuge in the opinion that the Bible allows the supposition of annihilation for the impenitent; but the rigid sequence of Dr. Cumming s reasoning will not admit of this idea. He sees that flax is made into linen, and linen into paper; that paper, when burned, partly ascends as smoke and then again descends in rain, or in dust and carbon.  Not one particle of the original flax is lost, although there may be not one particle that has not undergone an entire change: annihilation is not, but change of form is. It will be thus with our bodies at the resurrection. The death of the body means not annihilation. Not one feature of the face will be annihilated.  Having established the perpetuity of the body by this close and clear analogy, namely, that as there is a total change in the</p><p>particles of flax in consequence of which they no longer appear as flax, so there will not be a total change in the particles of the human body, but they will reappear as the human body, he does not seem to consider that the perpetuity of the body involves the perpetuity of the soul, but requires separate evidence for this, and finds such evidence by begging the very question at issue namely, by asserting that the text of the Scripture implies  the perpetuity of the punishment of the lost, and the consciousness of the punishment which they endure.  Yet it is drivelling like this which is listened to and lauded as eloquence by hundreds, and which a Doctor of Divinity can believe that he has his  reward as a saint  for preaching and publishing!</p><p>One more characteristic of Dr. Cumming s writings, and we have done. This is the perverted moral judgment that everywhere reigns in them. Not that this perversion is peculiar to Dr. Cumming: it belongs to the dogmatic system which he shares with all evangelical believers. But the abstract tendencies of systems are represented in very different degrees, according to the different characters of those who embrace them; just as the same food tells differently on different constitutions: and there are certain qualities in Dr. Cumming that cause the perversion of which we speak to exhibit itself with peculiar prominence in his teaching. A single extract will enable us to explain what we mean: </p><p> The  thoughts  are evil. If it were possible for human eye to discern and to detect the thoughts that flutter around the heart of an unregenerate man to mark their hue and their multitude, it would be found that they are indeed  evil.  We speak not of the thief, and the murderer, and the adulterer, and such like, whose crimes draw down the cognizance of earthly tribunals, and whose unenviable character it is to take the lead in the paths of sin; but we refer to the men who are marked out by their practice of many of the seemliest moralities of life by the exercise of the kindliest affections, and the interchange of the sweetest reciprocities and of these men, if unrenewed and unchanged, we pronounce that their thoughts are evil. To ascertain this, we must refer to the object around which our thoughts ought continually to circulate. The Scriptures assert that this object is the glory of God; that for this we ought to think, to act, and to speak; and that in thus thinking, acting, and speaking, there is involved the purest and most endearing bliss. Now it will be found true of the most amiable men, that with all their good society and kindliness of heart, and all their strict and unbending integrity, they never or rarely think of the glory of God. The question never occurs to them Will this redound to the glory of God? Will this make his name more known, his being more loved, his praise more sung? And just inasmuch as their every thought comes short of this lofty aim, in so much does it come short of good, and entitle itself to the character of evil. If the glory of God is not the absorbing and the influential aim of their thoughts, then they are evil; but God s glory never enters into their minds. They are amiable, because it chances to be one of the constitutional tendencies of their individual character, left uneffaced by the Fall; and they are just and upright, because they have perhaps no occasion to be otherwise, or find it subservient to their interests to maintain such a character.  Occ. Disc.  vol. i. p. 8.</p><p>Again we read (Ibid. p. 236): </p><p> There are traits in the Christian character which the mere worldly man cannot understand. He can understand the outward morality, but he cannot understand the inner spring of it; he can understand Dorcas  liberality to the poor, but he cannot penetrate the ground of Dorcas  liberality. Some men give to the poor because they are ostentatious, or because they think the poor will ultimately avenge their neglect; but the Christian gives to the poor, not only because he has sensibilities like other men, but because inasmuch as ye did it to the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me.</p><p>Before entering on the more general question involved in these quotations, we must point to the clauses we have marked with italics, where Dr. Cumming appears to express sentiments which, we are happy to think, are not shared by the majority of his brethren in the faith. Dr. Cumming, it seems, is unable to conceive that the natural man can have any other motive for being just and upright than that it is useless to be otherwise, or that a character for honesty is profitable; according to his experience, between the feelings of ostentation and selfish alarm and the feeling of love to Christ, there lie no sensibilities which can lead a man to relieve want. Granting, as we should prefer to think, that it is Dr. Cumming s exposition of his sentiments which is deficient rather than his sentiments themselves, still, the fact that the deficiency lies precisely here, and that he can overlook it not only in the haste of oral delivery but in the examination of proof-sheets, is strongly significant of his mental bias of the faint degree in which he sympathizes with the disinterested elements of human feeling, and of the fact, which we are about to dwell upon, that those feelings are totally absent from his religious theory. Now, Dr. Cumming invariably assumes that, in fulminating against those who differ from him, he is standing on a moral elevation to which they are compelled reluctantly to look up; that his theory of motives and conduct is in its loftiness and purity a perpetual </p><p>rebuke to their low and vicious desires and practice. It is time he should be told that the reverse is the fact; that there are men who do not merely cast a superficial glance at his doctrine, and fail to see its beauty or justice, but who, after a close consideration of that doctrine, pronounce it to be subversive of true moral development, and therefore positively noxious. Dr. Cumming is fond of showing up the teaching of Romanism, and accusing it of undermining true morality: it is time he should be told that there is a large body, both of thinkers and practical men, who hold precisely the same opinion of his own teaching with this difference, that they do not regard it as the inspiration of Satan, but as the natural crop of a human mind where the soil is chiefly made up of egoistic passions and dogmatic beliefs. </p><p>Dr. Cumming s theory, as we have seen, is that actions are good or evil according as they are prompted or not prompted by an exclusive reference to the  glory of God.  God, then, in Dr. Cumming s conception, is a being who has no pleasure in the exercise of love and truthfulness and justice, considered as affecting the well-being of his creatures; He has satisfaction in us only in so far as we exhaust our motives and dispositions of all relation to our fellow-beings, and replace sympathy with men by anxiety for the  glory of God.  The deed of Grace Darling, when she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women, was not good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and impelled her to brave death for the chance of saving others; it was only good if she asked herself Will this redound to the glory of God? The man who endures tortures rather than betray a trust, the man who spends years in toil in order to discharge an obligation from which the law declares him free, must be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellow-man, but by a desire to make  the name of God more known.  The sweet charities of domestic life the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness, the forbearance toward frailties, the prompt helpfulness in all efforts and sympathy in all joys, are simply evil if they result from a  constitutional tendency,  or from dispositions disciplined by the experience of suffering and the perception of moral loveliness. A wife is not to devote herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of the duties implied by a close relation she is to be a faithful wife for the glory of God; if she feels her natural affections welling up too strongly, she is to repress them; it will not do to act from natural affection she must think of the glory of God. A man is to guide his affairs with energy and discretion, not from an honest desire to fulfil his responsibilities as a member of society and a father, but that  God s praise may be sung.  Dr. Cumming s Christian pays his debts for the glory of God; were it not for the coercion of that supreme motive, it would be evil to pay them. A man is not to be just from a feeling of justice; he is not to help his fellow-men out of good-will to his fellow-men; he is not to be a tender husband and father out of affection: all these natural muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by a patent steel-spring anxiety for the  glory of God.</p><p>Happily, the constitution of human nature forbids the complete prevalence of such a theory. Fatally powerful as religious systems have been, human nature is stronger and wider than religious systems, and though dogmas may hamper, they cannot absolutely repress its growth: build walls round the living tree as you will, the bricks and mortar have by and by to give </p><p>way before the slow and sure operation of the sap. But next to the hatred of the enemies of God which is the principle of persecution, there perhaps has been no perversion more obstructive of true moral development than this substitution of a reference to the glory of God for the direct promptings of the sympathetic feelings. Benevolence and justice are strong only in proportion as they are directly and inevitably called into activity by their proper objects; pity is strong only because we are strongly impressed by suffering; and only in proportion as it is compassion that speaks through the eyes when we soothe, and moves the arm when we succor, is a deed strictly benevolent. If the soothing or the succor be given because another being wishes or approves it, the deed ceases to be one of benevolence, and becomes one of deference, of obedience, of self-interest, or vanity. Accessory motives may aid in producing an action, but they presuppose the weakness of the direct motive; and conversely, when the direct motive is strong, the action of accessory motives will be excluded. If, then, as Dr. Cumming inculcates, the glory of God is to be  the absorbing and the influential aim  in our thoughts and actions, this must tend to neutralize the human sympathies; the stream of feeling will be diverted from its natural current in order to feed an artificial canal. The idea of God is really moral in its influence it really cherishes all that is best and loveliest in man only when God is contemplated as sympathizing with the pure elements of human feeling, as possessing infinitely all those attributes which we recognize to be moral in humanity. In this light, the idea of God and the sense of His presence intensify all noble feeling, and encourage all noble effort, on the same principle that human sympathy is found a source of strength: the brave man feels braver when he knows that another stout heart is beating time with his; the devoted woman who is wearing out her years in patient effort to alleviate suffering or save vice from the last stages of degradation, finds aid in the pressure of a friendly hand which tells her that there is one who understands her deeds, and in her place would do the like. The idea of a God who not only sympathizes with all we feel and endure for our fellow-men, but who will pour new life into our too languid love, and give firmness to our vacillating purpose, is an extension and multiplication of the effects produced by human sympathy; and it has been intensified for the better spirits who have been under the influence of orthodox Christianity, by the contemplation of Jesus as  God manifest in the flesh.  But Dr. Cumming s God is the very opposite of all this: he is a God who instead of sharing and aiding our human sympathies, is directly in collision with them; who instead of strengthening the bond between man and man, by encouraging the sense that they are both alike the objects of His love and care, thrusts himself between them and forbids them to feel for each other except as they have relation to Him. He is a God who, instead of adding his solar force to swell the tide of those impulses that tend to give humanity a common life in which the good of one is the good of all, commands us to check those impulses, lest they should prevent us from thinking of His glory. It is in vain for Dr. Cumming to say that we are to love man for God s sake: with the conception of God which his teaching presents, the love of man for God s sake involves, as his writings abundantly show, a strong principle of hatred. We can only love one being for the sake of another when there is an habitual delight in associating the idea of those two beings that is, when the object of our indirect love is a source of joy and honor to the object of our direct love; but according to Dr. Cumming s theory, the majority of mankind the majority of his neighbors are in precisely the opposite relation to God. His soul has no pleasure in them, they belong more to Satan than to Him, and if they contribute to His glory, it is against their will. Dr. Cumming then can only love some men for God s sake; the rest he must in consistency hate for God s sake.</p><p>There must be many, even in the circle of Dr. Cumming s admirers, who would be revolted by the doctrine we have just exposed, if their natural good sense and healthy feeling were not early stifled by dogmatic beliefs, and their reverence misled by pious phrases. But as it is, many a rational question, many a generous instinct, is repelled as the suggestion of a supernatural enemy, or as the ebullition of human pride and corruption. This state of inward contradiction can be put an end to only by the conviction that the free and diligent exertion of the intellect, instead of being a sin, is part of their responsibility that Right and Reason are synonymous. The fundamental faith for man is, faith in the result of a brave, honest, and steady use of all his faculties: </p><p> Let knowledge grow from more to more,</p><p>But more of reverence in us dwell; </p><p>That mind and soul according well </p><p>May make one music as before, </p><p>But vaster. </p><p>Before taking leave of Dr. Cumming, let us express a hope that we have in no case exaggerated the unfavorable character of the inferences to be drawn from his pages. His creed often obliges him to hope the worst of men, and exert himself in proving that the worst is true; but thus far we are happier than he. We have no theory which requires us to attribute unworthy motives to Dr. Cumming, no opinions, religious or irreligious, which can make it a gratification to us to detect him in delinquencies. On the contrary, the better we are able to think of him as a man, while we are obliged to disapprove him as a theologian, the stronger will be the evidence for our conviction, that the tendency toward good in human nature has a force which no creed can utterly counteract, and which insures the ultimate triumph of that tendency over all dogmatic perversions. </p><p>MARGARET FULLER AND MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. </p><p>Woman in the Nineteenth Century, and Kindred Papers relating to the Sphere, Condition, and Duties of Woman. By Margaret Fuller Ossoli.	Trubner and Co.</p><p>THE dearth of new books just now gives us time to recur to less recent ones which we have hitherto noticed but slightly; and among these we choose the late edition of Margaret Fuller’s Woman in the Nineteenth Century, because we think it has been unduly thrust into the background by less comprehensive and candid productions on the same subject. Notwithstanding certain defects of taste and a sort of vague spiritualism and grandiloquence which belong to all but the very best American writers, the book is a valuable one: it has the enthusiasm of a noble and sympathetic nature, with the moderation and breadth and large allowance of a vigorous and cultivated understanding. There is no exaggeration of woman’s moral excellence or intellectual capabilities; no injudicious insistence on her fitness for this or that function hitherto engrossed by men; but a calm plea for the removal of unjust laws and artificial restrictions, so that the possibilities of her nature may have room for full development, a wisely stated demand to disencumber her of the</p><p>		Parasitic forms</p><p>	That seem to keep her up, but drag her down­-</p><p>	And leave her field to burgeon and to bloom</p><p>	From all within her, make herself her own</p><p>	To give or keep, to live and learn and be</p><p>	All that not harms distinctive womanhood.</p><p>It is interesting to compare this essay of Margaret Fuller's published in its earliest form in 1843, with a work on the position of woman, written between sixty and seventy years ago-we mean Mary Wollstonecraft's Rights of Woman. The latter work was not continued beyond the first volume; but so far as this carries the subject, the comparison, at least in relation to strong sense and loftiness of moral tone, is not at all disadvantages to the woman of the last century. There is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the Rights of Woman as in some or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withall rather heavy--the true reason, perhaps, that no edition has been republished since 1796, and that it is now rather scarce. There are several points of resemblance, as well as of striking difference, between these two books. A strong understanding is present in both; but Margaret Fuller’s mind was like some regions of her own American continent, where you are constantly stepping from sunny ‘clearings’ into the mysterious twilight of the tangled forest--she often passes in one breath from forcible reasoning to dream vagueness; moreover, her unusually varied culture gives her great command of illustration. Mary Wollstonecraft, on the other hand, is nothing if not rational; she has no erudition, and her grave pages are lit up by no ray of fancy. In both writers we discern, under the brave bearing of a strong and truthful nature, the beating of a loving woman’s heart, which teaches them not to undervalue the smallest offices of domestic care or kindliness. But Margaret Fuller, with all her passionate sensibility, is more of the literary woman who would not have been satisfied without intellectual production; Mary Wollstonecraft, we imagine, wrote not at all for writing's sake, but from the pressure of other motives. So far as a difference of date allows, there is a striking coincidence in their train of thought; indeed, every important idea in the Rights of Woman, except the combination of home education with a common day-school for boys and girls, reappears in Margaret Fuller's essay. </p><p>One point on which they both write forcibly is the fact that, while men have a horror of such faculty or culture in the other sex as tends to place it on a level with their oen, they are really in a state of subjection to ignorant and feeble-minded women. Margaret Fuller says: </p><p>Whenever man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty or brutal stupidity, to care for the comforts of the fireside, or the bloom and ornament of life, woman has always power enough, if she choose to exert it, and is usually disposed to do so, in proportion to her ignorance and childish vanity. Unaquainted with the importance of life and its purposes, trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty power, she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at the moment, and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to gratify the pique of a female favourite. The English shopkeeper's wife does not vote, but it is for her interest that the politician canvasses by the coarsest flattery.</p><p>Again: </p><p>All wives, bad or good, loved or unloved, inevitably influence their husbands from the power their position not merely gives, but necessitates of colouring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when the--patient, shall I call him?--is off his guard. </p><p>Hear now what Mary Wollstonecraft says on the same subject: </p><p>Women have been allowed to remain in ignorance and slavish dependence many, very many years, and still we hear of nothing but their fondness for pleasure and sway, their preference of rakes and soldiers, their childish attachment to toys, and the vanity that makes them value accomplishments more than virtue. History brings forward a fearful catalogue of the crimes which their cunning has produced, when the weak slaves have had sufficient address to overreach their masters.... When, therefore, I call women slaves, I mean in a political and civil sense; for indirectly they obtain too much power, and are debased by their exertions to obtain illicit sway.... The libertinism and even the virtue of superior men, will always give women of some description great power over them; and these weak women, under the influence of childish passion and selfish vanity, will throw a false light over the objects which the very men view with their eyes who ought to enlighten their judgment. Men of fancy, and those sanguine characters who mostly hold the helm of human affairs in general, relax in the society of women; and surely I need not cite to the most superficial reader of history the numerous examples of vice and oppression which the private intrigues of female favorites have produced; not to dwell on the mischief that naturally arises from the blundering interposition of well-meaning folly. For in the transaction of business it is much better to have to deal with a knave than a fool, because a knave adheres to some plan, and any plan of reason may be seen through soon than a sudden flight of folloy. The power which vile and foolish women have had over wise men who possessed sensibility is notorious. </p><p>There is a notion commonly entertained among men that an instructed woman, capable of having opinions, is likely to prove an impracticable yoke-fellow, always pulling one way when her husband wants to go the other, oracular in tone, and prone to give curtain lectures on metaphysics. But surely, so far as obstinancy is concerned, your unreasoning animal is the most unmanageable of creatures, where you are not allowed to settle the question by a cudgel, a whip and bridle, or even a string to the leg. For our own parts, we see no consistent or commodious medium between the old plan of corporal discipline and that thorough education of women which will make them rational beings in the highest sense of the word. Wherever weakness is not harshly controlled it must govern, as you may see when a strong man holds a little child by the hand, how he is pulled hither and thither, and wearied in his walk by his submission to the whims and feeble movements of his companion. A really cultured woman, like a really cultured man, will be ready to yield in trifles. So far as we see, there is no indisoluble connexion between infirmity of logic and infirmity of will, and a woman quite innocent of an opinion about the kitchen. As to airs of superiority, no woman ever had them in consequence of true culture, but only because her culture was shallow or unreal, only as a result of what Mrs. Malaprop well calls "the ineffectual qualities in a woman"--mere acquisitions carried about, and not knowledge thoroughly assimilated so as to enter into the growth of the character.</p><p>To return to Margaret Fuller, some of the best things she says are on the folly of absolute definitions of woman’s nature and absolute demarcation of woman’s mission. ‘Nature,’ she says, ‘seems to delight in varying the arrangements, as if to show that it will be fettered by no rule; and we must admit the same varieties that she admits.’ Again: ‘If nature is never bound down, the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. We are pleased women should write and speak if they feel need of it, from having something to tell; but silence for ages would be no misfortune, if that silence be from divine command, and not from tradition.’ And here is a passage, the beginning of which is often quoted: </p><p>If you ask me what offices they (women) may fill, I reply--any. I do not care what case you put; let them be sea-captains if you will. I do not doubt there are women well fitted for such an office, and, if so, I should be as glad as to welcome the Maid of Saragossa, or the Maid of Missolonghi, or the Suliote heroine, or Emily Plater. I think women need, especially at this juncture, a much greater occupation than they have. to rouse their latent powers.... In families that I know, some little girls like to saw wood or use carpenter’s tools. Where these tastes are indulged, cheerfulness and good-humour are promoted. Where they are forbidden, because "such things are not proper for girls," they grow sullen and mischievous. Fourier had observed these wants of women, as no one can fail to do  who watches the desires of little girls, or knows the ennui that haunts grown women, except where they make to themselves a serene little world by art of some kind. He, therefore, in proposing a great variety of employments, in manufactures or the care of plants and animals, allows for one-third of women as likely to have a taste for masculine pursuits, one-third of men for feminine.... I have no doubt, however, that a large proportion of women would give themselves to the same employments as now, because there are circumstances that must lead them. Mothers will delight to make the nest soft and warm. Nature would take care of that; no need to clip the wings of any bird that wants to soar and sing, or finds in itself the strength of pinion for a migratory flight unusual to its kind. The difference would be that all need not be constrained to employments for which some are unfit.</p><p>A propos of the same subject, we find Mary Wollstonecraft offering a suggestion which the women of the United States have already begun to carry out. She says: </p><p>Women, in particular, all want to be ladies, Which is simply to have nothing to do, but listlessly to go they scarcely care where, for they cannot tell what. But what have women to do in society? I may be asked, but to loiter with easy grace; surely you would not condemn them all to suckle fools and chronicle small beer. No. Women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses.... Business of various kinds they might likewise pursue, if they were educated in an orderly manner.... Women would not then marry for a support, as men accept of places under government, and neglect the implied duties. </p><p>Men pay a heavy price for their reluctance to encourage self-help and independent resources in women. The precious meridian years of many a man of genius have to be spent in the toil of routine, that an "establishment" may be kept up for a woman who can understand none of his secret yearnings, who is fit for nothing but to sit in her drawing-room like a doll-Madonna in her shrine. No matter. Anything is more endurable than to change our established formulae about women, or to run the risk of looking up to our wives instead of looking down on them. Sit divus, dummodo non sit vivus (let him be a god, provided he be not living), said the Roman magnates of Romulus; and so men say of women, let them be idols, useless absorbents of precious things, provided we are not obliged to admit them to be strictily fellow-beings, to be treated, one and all, with justice and sober reverence.</p><p>On one side we hear a woman's position can never be improved until women themselves are better; and, on the other, that women can never become better until their position is improved--until the laws are made more just, and a wider field opened to feminine activity. But we constantly hear the same difficulty stated about the human race in general. There is a perpetual action and reaction between individuals and institutions; we must try and mend both by little and little--the only way in which human things can be mended. Unfortunately, many overzealous champions of women assert their actual equality with men--nay, even their moral superiority to men--as a ground for their release from oppressive laws and restrictions. They lose strength immensely by this false position. If it were true, then there would be a case in which slavery and ignorance nourished virtue, and so far we should have an argument for the continuance of bondage. But we want freedom and culture for woman, because subjection and ignorance have debased her, and with her, Man; for-- </p><p>	If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,</p><p>	How shall men grow?</p><p>Both Margaret Fuller and Mary Wollstonecraft have too much sagacity to fall into this sentimental exaggeration. Their ardent hopes of what women may become do not prevent them from seeing and painting women as they are. On the relative moral excellence of men and women Mary Wollstonecraft speaks with most decision: </p><p>Women are supposed to possess more sensibility, and even humanity, than men, and their strong attachments and instantaneous emotions of compassion are given as proofs; but the clinging affection of ignorance has seldom anything noble in it, and may mostly be resolved into selfishness, as well as the affection of children and brutes. I have known many weak women whose sensibility was totally engrossed by their husbands; and as for their humanity, it was very faint indeed, or rather it was only a transient emotion of compassion. Humanity does not consist "in a squeamish ear," says an eminent orator. "It belongs to the mind as well as to the nerves." But this kind of exclusive affection, though it degrades the individual, should not be brought forward as a proof of the inferiority of the sex, because it is the natural consequence of confined views; for even women of superior sense, having their attention turned to little employments and private plans, rarely rise to heroism, unless when spurred on by love! And love, as an heroic passion, like genius, appears but once in an age. I therefore agree with the moralist who asserts "that women have seldom so much generosity as men;" and that their narrow affections, to which justice and humanity are often sacrificed, render the sex apparently inferior especially as they are commonly inspired by men; but I contend that the heart would expand as the understanding gained strength, if women were not depressed from their cradles. </p><p>We had marked several other passages of Margaret Fuller’s for extract but as we do not aim at an exhaustive treatment of our subject, and are only touching a few of its points, we have, perhaps, already claimed as much of the reader’s attention as he will be willing to give to such desultory material. </p><p>TRANSLATIONS AND TRANSLATORS. </p><p>Uniforme of Pure Renown. Translated from the German of Emanuel Kant by J. M. D. Meiklejohn. (Bohn's Philosophical Library.)</p><p>Specimens of the Choicest Lyrical Productions of the most Celebrated German Public. With Biographical and Literary Notes. Translated in English Verse by Mary Anner Burt. Second Edition. </p><p>London: Hall, Virtue, and Co. </p><p>A CLERGYMAN (of the Charles Honeyman species) once told us that he never set about preparing his sermons till Saturday evening, for he "trusted to Providence." A similar kind of trust, we suppose, must be prevalent among translators, for many of them are evidently relying on some power which </p><p>	Can teach all people to translate,</p><p>	Though out of languages in which</p><p>	They understand no part of speech—</p><p>a Nachklang, or resonance, perhaps, of the famous legend about those early translators, the Seventy who turned the Old Testament into Greel, which legend tells how Ptolemy shut them up in separate cells to do their work, and how, when they came to compare their renderings, there was perfect agreement! We are convinced, however, that the translators of the Septuagint had some understanding of their business to begin with, or this supernatural aid would not have been given, for in the matter of translation, at least, we have observed, that "God helps them who help themselves." A view of the case, which we commend to all young ladies and some middleaged gentlemen, who consider a very imperfect acquaintance with their own language, and an anticipatory acquaintance with the foreign language, quite a sufficient equipment for the office of translator. </p><p>It is perfectly true that, though geniuses have often undertaken translation, translation does not often demand genius. The power required in the translation varies with the power exhibited in the original work: very modest qualifications will suffice to enable a person to translate a hook of ordinary travels, or a slight novel, while a work of reasoning or science can be adequately rendered only by means of what is at present exceptional faculty and exceptional knowledge. Among books of this latter kind, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is perhaps the very hardest nut—the peachstone—for a translator to crack so as to lay open the entire uninjured kernel of meaning, and we are glad at last to believe that a translator of adequate power has been employed  upon it. For so far as we have examined the version placed at the head of our article, it appears to us very different indeed from the many renderings of German metaphysical works, in which the translator, having ventured into deep waters without learning to swim, clings to the dictionary, and commends himself to Providence. Mr. Meiklejohn's translation—so far, we must again observe, as we have examined it—informs[?] a real mastery of his author, and, for the first time, makes Kant's Critik der reinen Vernunft accessible to English readers.</p><p>It may seem odd that we should associate with this mighty book—this terrible ninety-gun ship—such a little painted pleasure-boat at Miss (or Mrs.) Burt's miscellaneous collection of translations from German lyric poets. But we are concerning outselves here simply with translation—no at all with Kant's Philosophy or with German Lyrics considered in themselves, and these two volumes happen to be the specimens of translation most recently presented to our notice. With regard to prose, we may very generally use Goldsmith's critical recipe, and say that the translation would have been better if the translator had taken more pains: but of poetical attempts we are often sure that no amount of pains would produce a satisfactory result. And so it is with Miss Burt's Specimens of the German Poets. She appears to have the knowledge and the industry which many translators want, but she has not the poetic power which makes poetical translations endurable to those acquainted with the originals. Amongst others, however, who have no such acquaintance, Miss Burt's translations seem to have been in some demand, since they have reached a second edition. She has been bold enough to attempt a version of Goethe's exquisite Zueignung (Dedication), and here is a specimen of her rendering, Goethe sings with divine feeling and music—</p><p>	Für andre wachst in mit das edle Gut,</p><p>	Ich kann und will das Pfund nicht mehr vergrahen,</p><p>	Warum saeld' ich den Weg so sebusuchtsyoll,</p><p>	Wenn ich ihn nicht den Brüdern zeigen solt?</p><p>Miss Burt follows him much as a Jew's harp would follow a piano— </p><p>	Entombed no longer shall my talent be,</p><p>	That treasure I amass, shall other's share?</p><p>	To find the road—oh, why such zeal display,</p><p>	If I guide not my brethren on their way?</p><p>A version like this bears about the same relation to the original as the portraits in an illustrated newspaper bear to the living face of the distinguished gentlemen they misrepresent; and considering how often we hear opinions delivered on foreign poets by people who only know those poets at second hand, it becomes the reviewer's duty to insist again and again on the inadequacy of poetic translations. </p><p>The Germans render our poetry better than we render theirs, for their language, as slow and unwieldy as their own post-horses in prose, becomes in poetry graceful and strong and flexible as an Arabian war-horse. Besides, translation among them is more often undertaken by men of genius. We remember, for example, some translation of Burns, by Freiligrath, which would have arrested us by their beauty if we had seen the poems, for the first time, in this language. It is true the Germans think a little too highly of their translations, and especially are under the illusion, encouraged by some silly English people, that Shakspeare according to Sehlegel is better for him to understand, but absolutely better as poetry. A very close and admirable rendering Sehlegel's assuredly is, and it is a high pleasure to track it in its faithful adherence to the original, just as it is to examine a fine engraving of a favourite picture. Sometimes the German is as good as the English—the same music played on another but as good an instrument. But more frequently the German is a feeble echo, and here and there it breaks down in a supremely fine passage. An instance of this kind occurs in the famous speech of Lorenzo to Jessica. Shakespeare says— </p><p>		Soft stillness and the night</p><p>	Become the touches of sweet harmony—</p><p>This Sehlegel renders— </p><p>		Saufte Still und Nacht</p><p>	Sie werden Tasten süsser Harmonie.</p><p>That is to say, "Soft stillness and the night are the finger-board of sweet harmony." A still worse blunder is made by Tieck (whose translation is the rival of Schlegel's) in the monologue of Macbeth. In the lines— </p><p>		That but this blow</p><p>	Might be the be-all and the end-all here—</p><p>	But here upon this bank and shoal of time,</p><p>	I'd jump the life to come—</p><p>Tieck renders, "Upon this bank and shoal of time," "Auf dieser Schulerbunk der Gegenwart," that is, "On this school-bench of the present!" These are cases of gross inaccuracy arising from an imperfect understanding of the original. Here is an instance of feebleness. Coriolanus says—</p><p>	And like an eagle in the dovecote, I</p><p>	Flutter'd the Volscians in Corioli,</p><p>For the admirably descriptive word "fluttered," Schlegel gives "schlug," which simply means slow. </p><p>Such examples of translators' fallibility in men like Schlegel and Tieck might well make less accomplished persons more backward in undertaking the translation of great poems, and by showing the difficulty of the translator's task, might make it an object of ambition to real ability. Though a good translator is infinitely below the man who produces good original works, he is infinitely above the man who produces feeble original works. We had meant to say something of the moral qualities especially demanded in the translator—the patience the rigid fidelity, and the sense of responsibility in interpreting another man's mind. But we have gossiped on this subject long enough. </p><p>THOMAS CARLYLE. </p><p>Passages selected from the Writings of Thomas Carlyle. With a Biographical Memoir. </p><p>By Thomas Ballantyne.	Chapman and Hall.</p><p>IT has been well said that the highest aim in education is analogous to the highest aim in mathematics, namely, to obtain not results but powers, not particular solutions, but the means by which endless solutions may be wrought. He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application; who does not seek to make his pupils moral by enjoining particular courses of action, but by bringing into activity the feelings and sympathies that must issue in noble action. On the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is not he who announces a particular discovery, who convinces men of a particular conclusion, who demonstrates that this measure is right and that measure wrong; but he who rouses in other the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost. The influence of such a writer is dynamic. He does not teach men how to use a sword and musket, but he inspires their soulds with courage and sends a strong will into their muscles. He does not, perhaps, enrich your stock of date, but he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverance as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit. </p><p>Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burst as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle's writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived. The character of his influence is best seen in the fact that many of the men who have the least agreement with his opinions are those to whom the reading of Sartor Resartus was an epoch in the history of their minds. The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good. There are plenty who question the justice of Carlyle's estimates of past men and past times, plenty who quarrel with the exaggerations of the Latter-Day Pamphlets, and who are as far as possible from looking for an amendment of things from a Carlylian theocracy with the "greatest man," as a Joshua who is to smite the wicked (and the stupid) till the going down of the sun. But for any large nature those points of difference are quite incidental. It is not as a theorist, but as a great and beautiful human nature, that Carlyle influences us. You may meet a man whose wisdom seems unimpeachable, since you find him entirely in agreement with yourself; but this oracular man of unexceptionable opinoins has a green eye, a wiry hand, and altogether a Wesen, or demeanour, that makes the world look blank to you, and whose unexceptionable opinions become a bore; while another man who deals in what you cannot but think "dangerous paradoxes," warms your heart by the pressure of his hand and looks out on the world with so clear and loving an eye, that nature seems to reflect the light of his glance upon your own feeling. So it is with Carlyle. When he is saying the very opposite of what we think, he says it so finely, with such hearty conviction--he makes the object about which we differ stand out in such grand relief under the clear light of his strong and honest intellect--he appeals so constantly to our sense of the manly and the truthful--that we are obliged to say "Hear! hear!" to the writer before we can give the decorous "Oh! oh!" to his opinions.</p><p>Much twaddling criticism has been spent on Carlyle's style. Unquestionably there are some genuine minds, not at all given to twaddle, to whom his style is antipathetic, who find it as unendurable as an English lady finds peppermint. Against antipathies there is no arguing; they are misfortunes. But instinctive repulsion apart, surely there is no one who can read and relish Carlyle without feeling that they could no more wish him to have written in another style than they could wish Gothic architecture not to be Gothic, or Raffaelle not to be Raffaellesque. It is the fashion to speak of Carlyle almost exclusively as a philosopher; but, to our thinking, he is yet more of an artist than a philosopher. He glances deep down into human nature, and shows the causes of human actions; he seizes grand generlisations, and traces them in the particular with wonderful acumen; and in all this he is a philosopher. But, perhaps, his greatest power lies in concrete presentation. No novelist has made his creations live for us more thoroughly than Carlyle and the Puritans. What humour in his pictures! Yet what depth of appreciation, what reverance or the great and godlike under every sort of earthly mummery! </p><p>It is several years now since we read a work of Carlyle's seriatim, but this our long-standing impression of him as a writer we find confirmed by looking over Mr. Ballantyne's Selections. Such a volume as this is surely a benefit to the public, for alas! Carlyle's works are still dear, and many who would like to have them are obliged to forego the possession of more than a volume or two. Through this good service of Mr. Ballantyne's, however, they may now obtain for a moderate sum a large collection of extracts--if not the best that could have been made, still very precious ones. </p><p>To make extracts from a book of extracts may at first seem easy, and to make extracts from a writer so well known may seem superfluous. The embarras de richesses and the length of the passages make the first not easy; and as to the second, why, we have reread these passages so often in the volumes, and now again in Mr. Ballantyne's selection, that we cannot suppose any amount of repetition otherwise than agreeable. We will, however, be sparing. Here is </p><p>	DAVID, THE HEBREW KING.</p><p>On the whole, we make too much of faults: the details of the busines hide the real centre of it. Faults? The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none. Readers of the Bible above all, one would think, might know better. Who is called there "the man according to God's own heart?" David, the Hebrew King, had fallen into sins enought; blackest crimes; there was not want of sins. And thereupon the unbelievers sneer and ask, Is this your man according to God's heart? The sneer, I must say, seems to me but a shallow one. What are faults, what are the outward details of a life, if the inner secret of it, the remorse, temptations, true, often-baffled, never-ended struggle of it, be forgotten? "It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." Of all acts is not, for a man, repentance the most divine? The deadliest sin, I say, were that same supercilious consciousness of no sin;--that is death; the heart so conscious is divorced from sincerity, humility, and fact; is dead: it is "pure" as dead dry sand is pure. David's life and history, as written for us in those Psalms of his, I consider to be the truest emblem ever given of a man's moral progress and warfare here below. All earnest souls will ever discern in it the faithful struggle of an earnest human soul towards what is good and best. Struggle often baffled, sore baffled, down as into entire wreck; yet a struggle never ended; ever, with tears, repentance, true unconquerable purpose, begun anew. Poor human nature! Is not a man's walking, in truth, always that: "a succession of falls?" Man can do no other. In this wild elements of a Life, he has to struggle onwards; now fallen, deep-abased; and ever, with tears, repentance, with bleeding heart, he has to rise again, struggle again still onwards. That his struggle be a faithful unconquerable one: that is the question of questions.</p><p>In another way how excellent is this on </p><p>	THE WORTH OF FORMULAS.</p><p>What we call "Formulas" are not in their origin bad; they are indispensably good. Formula is method, habitude, found wherever man is found. Formulas fashion themselves as Paths do, as beaten Highways, leading towards some sacred or high object, whither many men are bent. Consider it. One man, full of heartfelt earnest-impulse, finds out a way of doing somewhat--were it of uttering his soul's reverence for the Highest, were it but of fitly saluting his fellow-man. An inventor was needed to do that, a poet; he has articulated the dim-straggling, thought that dwelt in his own and many hearts. This is his way of doing that; these are his footsteps, the beginning of a "Path." And now see: the second man travels naturally in the footsteps of his foregoer: it is the easiest method. In the footsteps of his foregoer; yet with improvements, changes where such seem good; at all events with enlargements, the Path ever widening itself as more travel it;--till at last there is a broad Highway whereon the whole world may travel and drive. While there remains a City or Shrine, or any Reality to drive to, at the farther end, the Highway shall be welcome! When the City is gone, we will forsake the Highway In this manner all Institutions, Practices, Regulated Things in the world have come into existence, and gone out of existence. Formulas all begins by being full of substance; you may call them the skin, the articulation into shape, into limbs and skin, of a substance that is already there: they had not been there otherwise. Idols, as we said, are not idolatrous till they become doubtful, empty for the worshipper's heart. Much as we talk against Formulas, I hope no one of us is ignorant withal of the high significance of true Formulas; that they were, and will ever be, the indispensablest furniture of our habitation in this world. </p><p>Finally, this characteristic passage tempts us:-- </p><p>	THE APES OF THE DEAD SEA.--</p><p>Perhaps few narratives in History or Mythology are more significant than that Moslem one, of Moses and the Dwellers by the Dead Sea. A tribe of men dwelt on the shores of that same Asphaltic Lake; and having forgotten, as we are all prone to do, the inner facts of Nature, and taken up with the falsities and outer semblances of it, were fallen into sad conditions--verging indeed towards a certain far deeper Lake. Whereupon it pleased kind Heaven to send them the Prophet Moses, with an instructive word of warning, out of which might have sprung "remedial measures" not a few. But no: the men of the Dead Sea discovered, as the valet-species always does in heroes or prophets, no comeliness in Moses; listened with real tedium to Moses, with light grinning, or with splenetic sniffs and sneers, affecting even to yawn; and signified, in short, that they found him a humbug, and even a bore. Such was the candid theory these men of the Asphalt Lake formed to themselves of Moses, That probably he was a humbug, that certainly he was a bore. Moses withdrew; but Nature and her rigorous veracities did not withdraw. The Men of the Dead Sea, when we next went to visit them, were all "changed into Apes;" sitting on the trees there, grinning now in the most unaffected manner; gibbering and chattering complete nonsense; finding the whole Universe now a most undisputable Humbug! The Universe has become a Humbug to the Apes who thout it one! There they sit and chatter, to this hour; only I think, every Sabbath there returns to them a bewildered half-conciousness, half-reminiscence; and they sit, with their wizzened smoke-dried visages, and such an air of supreme tragicality as Apes may; looking out, through those blinking smoke-bleared eyes of theirs, into the wonderfulest universal smoky Twilight and undecipherable disordered Dusk of Things; wholly an Uncertainty, Unitelligibility, they and it; and for commentary thereon, here and there an unmusical chatter or mew;--truest, tragicalest Humbug conceivable by the mind of man or ape! They made no use of their souls; and so have lost them. Their worship on the Sabbath now is to roost there, with unmusical screeches, and half remember that they had souls. Didst thous never, O Traveller, fall in with parties of this tribe? Meseems they are grown somewhat numerous in our day.</p><p>BELLES LETTRES (JANUARY 1856). </p><p>WE never read Heinsius—a great admission for reviewer—but we learn from M. Arago that that formidably erudite writer pronounces Aristotle's works to be characterized by a majestic obscurity which repels the ignorant. We borrow these words to indicate what is likely to be the first impression of a reader who, Without any previous familiarity with Browning, glances through his two new volumes of poems.1 The less acute he is, the more easily will he arrive at the undeniable criticism, that these poems have a "majestic obscurity" which repels not only the ignorant but the idle. To read poems is often a substitute for thought: fine-sounding conventional phrases and the sing-song of verse demand no co-operation in the reader; they glide over his mind with the agreeable unmeaningness of "the compliments of the season," or a speaker's exordium on "feelings too deep for expression." But let him expect no such drowsy passivity in reading Browning. Here he will find no conventionality, no melodious common place, but freshness, originality, sometimes eccentricity of expression; no didactic laying-out of a subject, but dramatic indication, which requires the reader to trace by his own mental activity the underground stream of thought that jets out in elliptical and pithy verse. To read Browning he must exert himself, but he will exert himself to some purpose. If he finds the meaning difficult of access, it is always worth his effort—if he has to dive deep "he rises his pearl." Indeed, in Browning's best poems he makes us feel that what we took for obscurity in him was superficiality in ourselves. We are far from meaning that all his obscurity is like the obscurity of the stars, dependent simply on the feebleness of men's vision. On the contrary, our admiration for his genius only makes us feel the more acutely that its inspirations are too often straitened by the garb of whimsical mannerism with which he clothes them. This mannerism is even irritating sometimes, and should at least be kept under restraint in printed poems, where the writer is not merely indulging his own vein, but is avowedly appealing to the mind of his reader. </p><p>Turning from the ordinary literature of the day to such writer as Browning, is like turning from Flotow's music, made up of well—pieced shreds and patches, to the distinct individuality of Chopin's Studies or Schubert's Songs. Here, at least, is a man who has something of his own to tell us, and who with faultless art. There is nothing sickly or dreamy in him: he has a clear eye, a vigorous grasp, and courage to utter what he sees and handles. His robust energy is informed by a subtle, penetrating spirit, and this blending of opposite qualities gives his mind a rough piquancy that reminds one of russet apple. His keen glance pierces into all the secrets of human character, but, being as thoroughly alive to the outward as to the inward, he reveals those secrets, not by a process of dissection, but by dramatic painting. We fancy his own description of a  poet applies to himself:—</p><p>"He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade, </p><p>The man who slices lemons into drink, </p><p>"Men and Women." By Robert Browning. In 2 volc. London: Chapman and Hall. </p><p>The coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys </p><p>That volunteer to help him at the winch. </p><p>He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye, </p><p>And fly-leaf ballads on the vendor's string, </p><p>And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall. </p><p>He took such cognizance of men and things, </p><p>If any beat a horse, you felt he saw; </p><p>If any cursed a woman, he took note; </p><p>Yet stared at nobody,—they stared at him, </p><p>And found, less to their pleasure than surprise, </p><p>He seemed to know them and expect as much." </p><p>Browning has no soothing strains, no chants, no lullabys; he rarely gives voice to our melancholy, still less to our gaiety; he sets our thoughts at work rather than our emotions. But though eminently a thinker, he is as far as possible from prosaic; his mode of presentation is always concrete, artistic, and, where it is most felicitous, dramatic. Take, for example, "Fra Lippo Lippi," a poem at once original and perfect in its kind. The artist-monk, Fra Lippo, is supposed to be detected by the night-watch roaming the streets of Florence, and while sharing the wine with which he makes amends to the Dogberrys for the roughness of his tongue, he pours forth the story of his life and his art with the racy conversational vigour of a brawny genius under the influence of the Care dispeller. </p><p>"I was a baby when my mother died </p><p>And father died and left me in the street. </p><p>I starved there, God knows how, a year or two </p><p>On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks, </p><p>Refuse and rubbish.

And extracts from "Bishop Blougram's Apology," an equauy remarkable poem of what we may call the dramatic-psychological kind, would be still more ineffective. "Sylvester Blougram, styled in partibus Episcopus," talking </p><p>"Over the glass's edge when dinner's done </p><p>And body gets its sop and holds its noise </p><p>And leaves soul free a little," </p><p>with "Gigadibs the literary man," to who he is bent on proving by the most exasperatingly ingenious sophistry, that the theory of life on which he grounds his choice of being a bishop, though a doubting one, is wiser in the moderation of its ideal, with the certainty of attainment, than the Gigadibs theory, which aspires after the highest and attains nothing. The way in which Blougram's motives are dug up from below the roots, and laid bare to the very last fibre, not by a process of hostile exposure, not by invective or sarcasm, but by making himself exhibit them with a self-complacent sense of supreme acuteness, and even with a crushing force of worldly common sense, has the effect of masterly satire. But the poem is too strictly consecutive for any fragments of it to be a fair specimen. Belonging to the same order of subtle yet vigorous writing are the "Epistle of Karshish, the Arab physician; "Cleon," and "How it strikes a Contemporary." "In a Balcony," is so fine, that we regret it is not a complete drama instead of being merely the suggestion of a drama. One passage especially tempts us to extract.</p><p>		"All women love great men</p><p>If young or old—it is in all the tales— </p><p>Young beauties love old poets who can love— </p><p>Why should not he the poems in my soul, </p><p>The love, the passionate faith, the sacrifice, </p><p>The constancy? I throw them at his feet. </p><p>Who cares to see the fountain's very shape </p><p>And whether it be a Triton's or a Nymph's </p><p>That pours the foam, makes rainbows all around? </p><p>You could not praise indeed the empty conch; </p><p>But I'll pour floods of love and hide myself?" </p><p>These lines are less rugged than is usual with Browning's blank verse; but generally, the greatest deficiency we feel in his poetry is its want of music. The worst poems in his new volumes are, in our opinion, his lyrical efforts; for in these, where he engrosses us less by his thought, we are more sensible of his obscurity and his want of melody. His lyrics, instead of tripping along with easy grace, or rolling with a torrent-like grandeur, seem to be struggling painfully under burthen too heavy for them; and many of them have the disagreeable puzzling effect of a charade, rather than the touching or animating influence of song. We have said that he is never prosaic; and it is remarkable that in his blank verse, though it is often collogquial, we are never shocked by the sense of a sudden lapse into prose. Wordsworth is, on the whole, a far more musical poet than Browning, yet we remember no line in Browning so prosaic as many of Wordsworth's, which in some of his finest poems have the effect of bricks built into a rock. But we must also say that though Browning never flounders helplessly on the plain, he rarely soars above a certain table-land—a footing between the level of prose and the top most heights of poetry. He does not take possession of our souls and set them aglow, as the greatest poets—the greatest artists do. We admire his power, we are not subdued by it. Language with him does not seem spontaneously to link itself into song, as sounds link themselves into melody in the mind of the creative musician; he rather seems by his commanding powers to compel language into verse. He has chosen verse as his medium; but of our greatest poets we feel that they had no choice: Verse chose them. Still we are grateful that Browning chose this medium: we would rather have "Fra Lippo Lippi" than an essay on Realism in Art; we would rather have "The Statue and the Bust" than a three-volumed novel with the same moral; we would rather have "Holy Cross-Day" than Strictures on the Society for the Emancipation of the Jews." </p><p>By way of counterbalancing our judgment, we will give a parting quotation from one of the most musical of the rhymed poems. </p><p>"My perfect wife, my Leonor, </p><p>	Oh, heart my own, oh, eyes, mine too,</p><p>Whom else could I dare look backward for, </p><p>	With whom beside should I dare pursue</p><p>The path grey heads abhor? </p><p>"For it leads to a crag's sheer edge with them; </p><p>	Youth, flowery all the way, there stops—</p><p>Not they; age threatens and the contemn, </p><p>	Till they reach the gulf wherem youth drops,</p><p>One inch from our life's safe hem! </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>"My own, confirm me! If I tread </p><p>	This path back, is it not in pride</p><p>To think how little I dreamed it led </p><p>	To an age so blest that by its side</p><p>Youth seems the waste instead! </p><p>"My own, see where the years conduct! </p><p>	At first, 'twas something our two souls</p><p>Should mix as mists do: each is sucked </p><p>	Into each now; on, the new stream rolls, Whatever rocks obstruct."</p><p>To readers who find no compensation in Browning for his ruggedness and obscurity, who see no charm in his quaint embroideries, we recommend "The Poetical Works of Augustine Duganne,"2—a sort of poetical flowered calico of which we feel sure that the manufacturer can produce any quantity to order. Here they will find a large volume of smooth versifying on un exceptionable sentiments, adorned with a portrait of the author, presenting unexceptionable features. There is, we think, one touch of originality in Mr. Duganne's volume—a new form of affectation in his preface. A certain Mr. Lesley writes to "the author," urging him to publication in the following easy epistolary style, which you perceive at once was not meant for the public eye: "It is, of a Truth, too common, that the World hath little Care of its chiefest Treasures, whereby too often it hath lost divers Pearls, and indeed, first-water gems, that had been well coveted by the lordliest wishes," &amp;c., &amp;c. Whereupon Mr. Duganne, in a sentimental letter that, towards the end, bursts into lyrism to the extent of four stanzas, informs Mr. Lesley, that his wish regarding "my humble works" is "granted as soon as asked." A dramatic mode of indicating that the appearance of Mr. Duganne"s poems in what Mr. Lesley calls "synthetic garb"—meaning, in vulgar language, one volume large octavo—is simply a concession to friendly wishes, which we all know, from our </p><p>2 "The Poetical Works of Augustine Duganne." Philadelphia: Parry and McMillan.  </p><p>experience of authors, to be a highly probable state of the case. It is not from any desire to be severe on Mr. Duganne, but because We value simplicity as the small change of integrity, that we notice this affectation of his. The air of society is poisoned by transparent hypocrisies, which every one sees through and laughs at in his fellow-men, yet strangely enough believes to be impenetrable in his own case. Mr. Duganne has a satirical poem in which he appears to be as free from any pangs of diffidence as might be expected from the humility of his prefatory letter. In a note to this poem, he informs us that Longfellow's fame will rest chiefly on the merits of his early and "less pretending" lyrics, not foreseeing the appearance of Hiawatha,"3 which may rank with the "Scarlet Letter," as one of the two most indigenous and masterly productions in American literature. </p><p>The coincidences of publication do not often present so striking a conjunction as that of "Men and Women" and "Hiawatha." Browning's poems seem to smell of the warm south; they tell of pictures and statues, of the complex questions and the complex forms of life which belong to an old civilization. "Hiawatha" brings us a breeze from the forest and the prairie; it has the simplicity, the purely narrative spirit, the child like love of every outward detail, which belong to the primitive epic; it embalms the most human elements in the life and ideas of a race of hunters and warriors. "This Indian Edda, if I may so call it," says Longfellow, "is founded on a tradition prevalent among the North American Indians, of a personage of miraculous birth, who was sent among them to clear their rivers, forests, and fishing grounds, and to teach them the arts of peace. . . . . . With this old tradition I have woven other curious Indian legends. . . . The scene of the poem is among the Ojibways on the southern shore of Lake Superior, in the region between the Pictured Rocks and the Grand Sable." The metre which he has chosen, and which he manages with exquisite art, who are wise on such subjects tell us, derived from the ancient literature of Northern Europe, and its large, simple melody, is one of the greatest charms in the poem. Indeed, every time we look into the volume, this metre seems to have a stronger fascination for us. Longfellow has into the Indian names of animals and other natural objects with great effect, almost always indicating their meaning beforehand; and they drop in here and there at the end of the lines with charming contrast, like the little bells of the tambourine in the accompaniment to a song. "Hiawatha" must, we think, be equally delightful to childhood and maturity, as all poetry is that expresses primitive feelings and primitive forms of imagination. It is like flowers and birds, and the colours of sunset, which may be looked at with equal pleasure by the child and the man; for though the man sees more in them, the child sees them with a fresher sense. We recommend mothers who love poetry, to read "Hiawatha" aloud with their boys and girls. It is needless to give long extracts from a poem</p><p>3 "The Song of Hiawatha." By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. London: Bogue. </p><p>which may be had for a shilling, and which every one who has a shilling to spare will do well to buy: but if any of our readers need urging to this, the best persuasion we can think of is the poet's own invitation. </p><p>"Ye who love the haunts of Nature, </p><p>Love the sunshine of the meadow, </p><p>Love the shadow of the forest, </p><p>Love the wind among the branches, </p><p>And the rain-shower and the snow-storm, </p><p>And the rushing of great rivers </p><p>Through their palisades of pine-trees, </p><p>And the thunder in the mountains, </p><p>Whose innumerable echoes </p><p>Flap like eagles in their eyries; </p><p>Listen to these wild traditions, </p><p>To this Song of Hiawatha! </p><p>	Ye who love nation's legends,</p><p>Love the ballads of a people, </p><p>That like voices from afar off </p><p>Call to us to pause and listen, </p><p>Speak in tones so plain and child-like </p><p>Scarcely can the ear distinguish </p><p>Whether they are sung or spoken;— </p><p>Listen to this Indian Legend, </p><p>To this Song of Hiawatha! </p><p>	Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,</p><p>Who have faith in God and Nature, </p><p>Who believe that in all ages </p><p>Every human heart is human, </p><p>That in even savage bosoms </p><p>There are longings, yearnings, strivings </p><p>For the good they comprehend not. </p><p>That the feeble hands and helpless, </p><p>Groping blindly in the darkness, </p><p>Touch God's right hand in that darkness </p><p>And are lifted up and strengthened;—</p><p>Listen to this simple story, </p><p>To this Song of Hiawatha!" </p><p>Mrs. Ogilvy's Poems of Ten Years"' and Mr. Frothingham's Metrical Pieces,"5 (the latter sent to us from the other side of the Atlantic) belong to that dilettante class of productions which are not likely to have any greater result than that of giving refined occupation to the writer's leisure. Mr. Frothingham has translated from the Greek, with conscientious attention to literalness, the poem of Aratus on the Appearances of the Stars, a poem which is probably associated for the majority of readers only with the fact that it is quoted by St. Paul in his speech at Athens. The greater part of his volume however is occupied with translations from modern poets, chiefly German, and with original pieces. A far more elaborate work of learned leisure is Mr. Blew's meritorious translation of the Agamemnon,"6 accompanied with abundant notes, which show a quite curious acquaintance with recent literature. Mr. Michell, who has chosen for his theme "The Poetry of the Creation,"7 seems to be a worthy follower of </p><p>4 "Poems of Ten Years." By Mrs. D. Ogilvy.

London: Chapman and Hall. </p><p>Mr. Robert Montgomery; intimation which may serve either as a warning or a recommendation, according to the taste of our readers. </p><p>The novels of the quarter are far from being as striking as the poetry. The first in ability and interest is unquestionably "Doctor Antonio."8 It is a singular book; singular as the production of an Italian who writes English better than the vast majority of English authors, and singular as exhibiting undeniable originality and power amid the most ordinary commonplaces of fiction. The story and the incidents are so hackneyed that for a long while it was only the superiority of the writing which carried us forward; but as there was no mistaking the presence of a vigorous and remarkable mind, we read on in spite of the incredulus odi and the echoes of the circulating library. When will novelists give up introducing their heroes and heroines by means of runaway horses and broken-down carriages? Antonio meets Lucy in this way. She has broken her leg, and he, being a medical man, sets it, of course; and it is equally en règle that he falls in love with her. Of course her father is as proud and as absurd as the British aristocrat has privilege to be in the volumes of the foreign novelist, and there is a rough brother who steps in to prevent the course of true love from running smooth. Perhaps it is rather less of course that Lucy marries a nobleman, but having that datum, you are sure the nobleman will conveniently leave widow, so that she may return to Italy to seek Antonio. She finds him risking his life in the Neapolitan insurrection, and the avowal of her love is wrung from her in a scene which will recall to every one the great duo between Raoul and Valentine in the Huguenots. Antonio is wounded at the barricade, tried and condemned to the galleys; he refuses to accept the escape she arranges for him, because his companions cannot escape also; and she then dies broken-hearted. "Doctor Antonio still suffers, prays, and hopes for his country." Such is the commonplace frame-work of the most remarkable novel this season has produced. The writing, as we have intimated, is throughout idiomatic, vigorous, picturesque. The characters of Antonio and Lucy, especially the latter, are touched with extreme delicacy of observation, and are very unlike the characters usually found in novels. The Italian peasants, it may be supposed, are faithfully drawn, the artist being an Italian and showing of painting English character, with which he would necessarily be less familiar than with Italian. But we cannot admire the portrait of the Baronet. It appears to us essentially a caricature, and not consistent even as a caricature. There are Englishmen, doubtless, prouder and even more absurd to be met with on many a continental highway; our objection to this Baronet is not that he is proud and absurd, but that he is not a human being. Very charming and delicate is the way in which the passion of Antonio and Lucy gradually unfolds itself before our eyes as</p><p>8 "Doctor Antonio." A Tale. By the Author of "Lorenzo Benoni." Edinburgh: Constable and Co. </p><p>it grows up in their hearts. The word love never passes between them, and yet we are made to feel their love perhaps all the more from this reticence. But the culminating point of interest in the book is where the writer, forsaking the function of a novelist, and sternly taking up that of a historian, presents us with a picture of the Neapolitan revolution, and the ghastly iniquity of Neapolitan trials. Here is truth that towers above the mere fiction of the novel, as the battle of Drumclog and the trial of the Covenanters tower above the sorrows of Henry Morton and Edith Bellenden in Old Mortality." </p><p>Next in merit is "Gilbert Massenger,"9 another one-volumed novel from the industrious pen of Holme Lee. The story is founded on the same question of conscience relative to hereditary insanity and marriage, which has already been chosen as a theme by Miss Jewsbury, in her "Constance Herbert," and by the author of "The House of Raby." The writer of “Gilbert Massenger” has excellent moral taste. There is no exaggeration in her sentiments, no impotent ambition in her style, and her narrative is easy and agreeable (we venture to use the feminine pronoun, because though the name of Holme Lee is unmistakably feminine). We see so marked an advance in her successive productions, that we hope she will, in future works, attain a more natural style of dialogue than we find in “Gilbert Massenger.” So far as our experience has gone, the following speech is not of the kind which sensible men of the world address to their nieces at the breakfast table:— </p><p>"You cannot deny—home-loving bird that you are—that you have often a hankering after those breezy Yorkshire fells, and the mossy hollows where the beck runs gurgling amongst stones. I have watched you, Helen, with your ear bent and hand suddenly arrested, listening to the pleasant echoes. I have known what you were dreaming about, by the saddened smile that fluttered on your lips and the light sigh that wafted away." </p><p>Beatrice Reynolds, who in "My First Season,"10 gives us an episode in her life, is not only feminine, which may be a merit, she is also frothy, which must be a demerit. We cannot recommend her as a companion even to idle persons, especially when there are such charming stories within reach as Tolla, of which an admirable English edition has just been published.11 We have already given our opinion, in a previous number, on the merits of this delightful tale—one of the few French fictions which can do no harm to the most inexperienced reader. Moreover, there is a cheap edition of </p><p>9 "Gilbert Massenger." By Holme Lee. London: Smith, Elder, and Co. </p><p>10 "My First Season."

Edinburgh: Constable &amp; Co. </p><p>"Villette,"12 which we, at least, would rather read for the third time than most new novels for the first. And even "Faces in the Fire"18 is harmless, which we can hardly say of the pert assumption that repels us in "My First Season." After reading more than half of "Faces in the Fire," we should have pronounced it an elaborate, but extremely feeble imitation of Dickens, if we had not happened to turn to the preface, where the author tells us—"Though I may, unconsciously, have sometimes adopted a style so natural and popular as that of Mr. Dickens's (sic), I have never, in my literary career, endeavoured to imitate his, or any other writer's, peculiarities of diction and incident." We immediately remembered what important distinctions lie in a refined use of language, as Pistol long ago admonished us—"Steal! Convey, the wise it call!"</p><p>Readable novels are not among the most plentiful productions of the German press, and for this reason we the more emphatically recommend "Nach Amerika," by Friedrich Gerstäcker." A rough indication of this writer's style may be gathered from the fact that he is called the "German Boz"—a name which leads to a comparison, certainly very disadvantageous to Herr Gerstäcker, so far as all Dickens's great qualities are concerned, but not in the least disadvantageous to him in relation to invention of incident and cleverness of construction. "Nach Amerika," is called by the author a "Volksbuch"—a book for the people—on the ground, we suppose, that it narrates the fortunes of German emigrants, poor and uneducated, as well as rich and cultivated. The author gives unity to the various threads of his story, by taking all his emigrants to America on board the same vessel, after having first depicted the different circumstances that led to their being "outward bound;"and his description of their transatlantic fortunes seems to have been drawn from the personal observation of a brisk and judicious mind. There is enough romance in the story to interest the novel reader, and enough truthful exhibition of life and character to arrest persons who care little for romance. The quality of the work being agreeable, it is not to be regretted that its quantity extends to five volumes. Unfortunately, this is the only German work before us from which we can promise our readers much pleasure. A very slight tasting of Bechstein's "Märchen und Sagen,"15 and of Aus der Gegenwart,"16 made us shrink from a repetition of the dose, and we give our experience to our readers for what they may think it worth. </p><p>Before taking leave of fiction, we have two extremely heterogeneous publications to mention, both of them interesting in their way. The first </p><p>12 "Villette." By Currer Bell. London: Smith, Elder, and Co. </p><p>13 "Faces in the Fire." By G. F. Pardon. London: Blackwood. </p><p>14 "Nach Amerika!" Ein Volksbuch.

Leipzig: Schultze. </p><p>is Mr. Bohn's edition of the "Greek Romances of Heliodorus, Longus, and Achilles Tatius,"17 a book which will be welcomed by those who are fond of what we may call comparative literature—who like to trace every type of literary creation in its less developed forms. The other is Miss Brewster's "Little Millie,"18 a story written for young servant girls. Besides the story, the small volume contains a variety of instructive matter, in the form of selections from Millie's Extract-book. Even those who do not share Miss Brewster's Evangelical point of view will see much that is valuable in this modest book, and will feel unmixed admiration for the writer's amiable devotion of her powers to this unassuming service. </p><p>In Herr Gerstäcker's pleasant book we have a picture of German life in America; we see the offspring of the Old World adapting himself, not without some pain, to the conditions of the New. But in a volume called "Walden; or, Life in the Woods"19—published last year, but quite interesting enough to make it worth while for us to break our rule by a retrospective notice—we have a bit of pure American life (not the "go ahead" species, but its opposite pole), animated by that energetic, yet calm spirit of innovation, that practical as well as theoretic independence of formulæ, which is peculiar to some of the finer American minds. The writer tells us how he chose, for some years, to be a stoic of the woods; how he built his house; how he earned the necessaries of his simple life by cultivating a bit of ground. He tells his system of diet, his studies, his reflections, and his observations of natural phenomena. These last are not only made by a keen eye, but have their interest enhanced by passing through the medium of a deep poetic sensibility; and, indeed, we feel throughout the book the presence of a refined as well as a hardy mind. People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy. Instead of contesting their opinion ourselves, we will let Mr. Thoreau speak for himself. There is plenty of sturdy sense mingled with his unworldliness.</p><p>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and </p><p>17 "The Greek Romances of Heliodorus, Longus and Achilles Tatius."

For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to 'glorify God and enjoy him for ever.' . . . . . . But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I confess that I have hitherto indulged bery little in philanthropic enterprises. I have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also. . . . . You must have a genius for charity as well as for anything else. As for doing good, that is one of the professions which are full. Morever, I have tried it fairly, and strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me, to save the universe from annihilation; and I believe that a like, but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not stand between any man, and his genius; and to him who does this work, which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I would say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing well, as it is most like they will. . . . . . Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he was kind to the poor—meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I once hears a reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary, and political worthies, Shakspeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England's best men and women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists. . . . . I would not have any one adopt my mode of living, on any account; for, beside that before he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way, and not his father's, or his mother's, or his neighbour's instead. The youth may build, or plant, or sail, only let him not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like to do."</p><p>We can only afford one more extract, which, to our minds, has great beauty. </p><p>"I did not read book the first summer: I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny door-way from sunrise till noon, wrapped in a reverie, amidst the pines, and hickories, and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sang around or flitted noiseless through the house, until, by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller's waggon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those season like corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been. . . . . My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that, 'for yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow, they have only one word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for to-morrow, and overheard for the passing day.' This was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the birds and flowers had tried me by their standard, I should not have been found wanting. A man must find his occasions in himself, it is true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove his indolence." </p><p>Apropos of everything, we introduce Lord Brougham's "Contributions to the Edinburgh Review,"20 which, apart from any of his lordship's other works, are a monument of his versatility. The subjects of these articles, which make three handsome octavo volumes, range under the heads of rhetoric, history, foreign policy, constitutional questions, political economy and finance, criminal law, physical science, and miscellaneous literature. It is not our office here to dwell on Lord Brougham's treatment of his more recondite subjects, but we may mention that, among the scientific articles, there is an interesting series on  Sir Humphry Davy's discoveries, written as those discoveries were successively made known. The gravity of these concise and clear accounts of scientific experiments is relieved by one of Lord Brougham's very unfrequent touches of humour, which easily lends itself to quotation. Having described Sir Humphry's discovery of the metallic bases, his lordship says:—</p><p>"He names them Potassium and Sodium,—names, as he remarks himself, more significant than elegant; but we are greatly relieved at finding them no worse. A report had reached us, of Sodagen and Potagen having been propounded by high chemical authority. It was even hinted that Mr. Tennant leaned towards such a nomenclature; and persons were not wanting who apprehended that, in this courtly age, some terms might be introduced complimentary to the best of Sovereigns and the purest of Church Establishments." </p><p>The historical articles are readable, anecdotic, and often indicative of special knowledge; but they are unorganized, often careless in their style, and have scarcely any of the qualities of permanent writing. The division of these volumes which most arrests us is that containing the Rhetorical articles. Here Lord Brougham writes with the fine appreciation of specific genius, and it is amazing to us how so able of critic of Demosthenes, Cicero, Massillon, and Erskine, can show so much heedlessness in his</p><p>20 "Contributions to the Edinburgh Review." By Henry, Lord Brougham. In 3 vols. London: Griffin and Co. </p><p>own manner of writing, and such frequent bad taste in his metaphors. In the excellent article on Demosthenes, he dwells on the interesting fact of this orator's continual repetitions of himself:— </p><p>"They who speak or write with little or no labour to themselves, and proportionably small satisfaction to others, would, in similar circumstances, find it far easier to compose anew than to recollect or go back to what they had finished on a former occasion. Not so the mighty Athenian, whom we find never disdaining even to make use of half a sentence which he had once happily wrought, and treasured up as complete; nay, to  draw part of a sentence from one quarter and part from another, applying them, by some slight change, to the new occasions, and perhaps adding some new member,—thus presenting the whole in its last form, made of portions fabricated at three different periods, several years asunder."</p><p>Since Lord Brougham seems to admire this slow elaboration and self-repetition in Demosthenes, we do not see why, in another place, he should be sarcastic on Sheridan for his elaboration and repetition of his witticisms, which constitute oratorical effects just as much as the most solemn or pathetic appeals. Referring to this practice of Sheridan's, revealed by Moore's publication of extracts from the wit's commonplace book, his lordship gives the following example in a note which may interest readers who are not familiar with Moore's "Life of Sheridan:— </p><p>"Take an instance from this author, giving extracts from the common-place-book of the wit:— 'He employs his fancy in his narrative, and keeps his recollections for his wit.' Again, the same idea is expanded into,—'When he makes his jokes, you applaud the accuracy of his memory; and 'tis only when he states his facts that you admire the flights of his imagination.' But the thought was too good to be thus wasted on the desert air of a common-place-book. So forth it came at expense of Kelly, who, having been a composer of music, became a wine-merchant. 'You will,' said the ready wit, 'import your music and compose your wine.' Nor was this service exacted from the old idea thought sufficient; so in the House of Commons an easy and apparently off-hand parenthesis was thus filled with it at Mr. Dundas's cost and charge ('who generally resorts to his memory for his jokes, and to his imagination for his facts.')" </p><p>We must now turn to the one subject into which Lord Brougham's multifarious studies do not seem to have led him—we mean ART. M. Rio gives us a compact and interesting volume on "Leonardo da Vinci and his School,21 not the less interesting because the writer, being a Catholic and a Romanticist, places us in a point of view which approximates to that of the artist's own age. M. Rio believes in relics and miraculous pictures, and the quiet unquestioning air with which he speaks of these things, tends to bring more vividly before the reader the influence they exercised on the Art of the Re </p><p>21 "Leonard de Vinci et son Ecole."  Par A. F.  </p><p>Rio. Paris: Bray.  </p><p>naissance. The career of Leonardo, which is introduced by a short historical sketch, tracing the progress of art in Milan up to 1483, when the great head of the Milanese school arrived there from his native Florence, is treated rather critically than biographically, and occupies no more than half the volume, the remainder being devoted to his imitators and successors.</p><p>Humanity is an ideal type, made up of fragments called men—some of them, it must be owned, very miserable chips indeed. But every now and then Nature puts this supreme type of hers into a smaller mould, and turns out humanity almost complete in the form of a single man—a man at once observant and speculative, practical and theoretic, artistic and reflective, grand in intellect, grand in feeling, and grand in physique. Such a man was Leonardo da Vinci. He was not only a painter who produced one of the sublimest pictures the world has ever seen, a sculptor, an architect, a musician, and a poet; he anticipated some of the grandest discoveries in physics, and there was hardly a department of science in which he had not aperçus, in which he did not throw out hypotheses and speculations; he was a first-rate civil and military engineer; he was a master of all personal accomplishments—of dancing, of horsemanship, and of fencing, which he raised to the rank of a science by writing the first treatise on it; with all his artistic delicacy of finger, he was so strong that he could twist the clapper of an enormous bell and bend a horse-shoe double: and this union of delicacy with strength was expressed in his face, which might serve as a model both for a genius and a sage. To crown all this, he was a man of noble and disinterested feeling, and of so sympathetic a nature that he would buy caged birds that he might have the pleasure of giving them their liberty: aveva grandissimo animo, says Vasari, ed in ogni sua azionc era generosissimo. </p><p>When Leonardo, in his thirtieth year, came to seek his fortune at Milan, he carried no testimonials from Florence, where his merits had been neglected by the Medici, but he addressed a letter to Lodovico il Moro, the reigning Duke of Milan, in which he stated his capabilities with the calm self-confidence of real power. "I can carry through every kind of work in sculpture in clay, marble, and bronze; also in painting I can execute everything that can he demanded, as well as any one whosoever." His achievements were not formed below his pretensions, and in this first residence at Milan he had ample scope for the exercise of his varied powers. Penetrated with the conviction that theoretic principle is a necessary basis of perfection in art, he founded and directed an Academy, the first institution of the kind in Italy, in which it was his object to further the investigation of all the great theoretic and practical questions in Art; and it was in the course of his instructions to his pupils in this academy that he wrote his Treatises on Perspective, on Light and Shadow, and on Painting. He was a diligent student of antiquity, and it was the object of his ardent hope that the discovery of some fresh treasures in ancient art and literature would throw light on the famous canon of Polycletes and on the true causes of the superiority of Greek Art. An interesting indication of this yearning exists in an epitaph, written for him during his life by a friend of his, apparently under his own inspiration, in which he styles himself simply "the admirer of the ancients and their grateful disciple," adding, "One thing has been wanting to me, their science of proportions; I have done what I could, let posterity pardon me." </p><p>	"Mirator veterum discipulusque memor</p><p>	Defuit una mihi symmetria prisca, peregi</p><p>	Quod potui: veniam da mihi, posteritas."</p><p>He was associated in the great work of carrying forward the erection of the Cathedral, the centre at once of national and princely interests, but a finer opportunity for his genius was given him in the commission to execute an equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, the founder of the reigning dynasty. His passion for horses could here find a grand expression through his art, and his success was so complete, that when, after a delay of ten years, the clay model of the statue was exhibited to the public view, it was universally pronounced superior to every other work of the same kind. It was doubtless, says M. Rio, from having caught the last echoes of this contemporary judgment, that Lodovico Dolce, in his dialogue on painting, written half a century later, spoke of Leonardo as a sublime genius, always dissatisfied with his own works, excelling in everything, but exciting astonishment by his manner of representing horses—stupendissimo in far cavalli. For, alas! Leonardo, having completed the creative part of his labour, deferred, in spite of the public importunity, giving his work a more durable form in bronze, and the model was utterly destroyed in the political troubles of 1499. A fate only a little less cruel awaited the sublime mural painting of the Last Supper, in the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, which he commenced immediately on finishing his equestrian statue, and in which he attained the highest conception of the Christ, as Raphael afterwards did of the Madonna. M. Rio tells us, that according to Lomazzo, who collected the traditions of Leonardo's own school, the head of Christ was the subject of long and deep meditation; the artist was continually absorbed in the contemplation of the Divinity, and his hand trembled whenever he began to paint this supreme object of art—a detail noticed by Dante in the devout painters of his time:—</p><p>	"Similemente operando all' artista</p><p>	Ch'ha'l' abito dell' arte e man che trema."</p><p>M. Rio of course insists on the high degree in which idealism entered into Leonardo's method, and blames Goethe's criticism as attributing a preponderance to naturalism, which is contradicted by the well-known answer that the artist gave to Lodovico il Moro, in excuse for his tardiness in execution—that it was not on earth he would seek his type of Christ. We are ready to wish that Francis I. could have succeeded in his project of carrying this great mural painting into France, where it would have been at least safer from the barbarous neglects and injuries which have at last robbed it of all existence except in copies and engravings; for we fear that the recent report of its restoration by some chemical process was only the expression of a vain hope. The proximate cause to which the world owed the production of this masterpiece was the fact that the Duchess Beatrice made the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie her favourite place of devotion, and hence her husband lavished on this church and the adjoining convent every species of ornament that art could furnish. Another circumstance equally characteristic of the age, gave rise to the next greatest picture of Leonardo, that of the Virgin seated on the lap of St. Ann, singularly enough the only picture of his mentioned by the historian Paulus Jovius. In 1485, a mysterious image of this Virgin in the church of San Celso appeared suddenly to emit a splendid light in the presence of some hundred worshippers. The report of this miracle having spread, the scene of this "divine manifestation" was crowded night and day with eager votaries, and the enthusiasm was so lasting, that even eleven years afterwards it was found necessary to construct an additional bridge to render less dangerous the perpetual flux and reflux of visitants, and finally to erect a larger and more magnificent church, for which ample funds were provided by the incessant offerings of the pious. It was for this new church that Leonardo painted his picture, now in the Belvedere gallery at Vienna. On the occupation of the Milanese by the enemy, Leonardo left Milan, and resided by turns at Florence and Rome. Once more he returned to Milan under the brilliant patronage of Francis I.: and it was to this monarch that he owed a peaceful retreat in his old age, at Clow, near Amboise, where he died in 1519. After tracing the progress and decline of Leonardo's school, M. Rio closes his volume with a brief but interesting account of the theoretic writings it produced, among which those of Lomazzo hold the chief place. This writer has a fanciful designation of the great masters by symbols: he assigns the supremacy to Michael Angelo, and gives him as an emblem the dragon, and as a characteristic, impassible contemplation; but Leonardo's majesty wins him the more engaging emblem of the lion, and his special merit is pronounced to be the science of chiaroscuro.</p><p>M. Rio's book belongs rather to the instructive than to the amusing class. But those who would like to be amused about pictures rather than instructed about them, may take up M. Edmond About's running criticism of the paintings and sculpture in the Paris Exposition.22 The reader may fancy himself walking through the department of Fine Art in company with a friend who is extremely witty, extremely French, and in the end, perhaps, a little fatiguing by force of his perpetual epigrams. Truffles are good things; but we do not like everything served with truffles. M. About does not emi </p><p>22 "Voyage à Travers l'Exposition des Beaux Arts (Peinture et Sculpture)." Par Edmond About. (Bibliothèque des Chemins de Fer.) Paris: Hachette. </p><p>nently possess, or at least exhibit, the happy power of describing pictures, but he has always something acute to say à propos of a picture, and if his criticism sometimes irritates us by its flimsimess, it has the airy smartness which we expect from flimsy things. Any one who is acquainted with the style of Cornelius's pictures, will recognise some truth under the following caricature:— </p><p>"M. Cornelius has talent, but a talent which has been strained. He meditates nothing but the grand, the powerful, the violent; I should like him sometimes to think of the natural. He treats the simplest and most familiar subjects with Titanic effort. Look, for example, at the cartoons which represent the Works of Christian Charity. If ever a painter ought to exhibit simplicity, it is on a subject of this kind; to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to relieve prisoners, to console the afflicted, to guide travellers who have lost their way, there is no need of either grand gestures, of enormous muscles, or dishevelled hair. But the frescoes of Michael Angelo and the admiration of the Berliners have persuaded M. Cornelius that genius consists in painting snaky hair, twisted drapery, writhing limbs, and shaggy chests. The Christian who descends into the prison to relieve the prisoners, is fifty times more majestic than Marius on the ruins of Carthage. The two consolers, who enter into the house of mourning, are more sombre and dramatic than Brutus and Cassius on the eve of the battle of Philippi, and the young man who is showing the way to the travellers resembles, at the very least, Cæsar pointing out the Rubicon. His mouth is open, as if he were haranguing an army, and he stretches out his arm as if to take possession of the world. This defect, is, perhaps, yet more perceptible in the picture where food and drink are distributed. The grand women in the foreground, with their grand arms, their grand faces, and their grand legs, have the fault of excessive grandeur. It is merit to hit one's aim—it is a demerit to shoot beyond it. The cook who is roasting a leg of mutton, to the left of the picture, pours out the gravy with a terribly magisterial air, and the butler, who empties a flask, reminds one of a river threatening an inundation. All the personages wear incoherent perruques; all the draperies are twisted about; the tent, which ought to cover the company, is so ingeniously festooned, that it runs from tree to tree without sheltering any one. All the animals are bad, the trees poor and dry, the architecture deplorable; but the human figures are worse. It is impossible to imagine anything more grimacing, more false, more ill-proportioned. One would suppose that the artist had made a vow not to look at nature. Assuredly, M. Cornelius has talent, but nature has yet more talent than he; and he would do well modestly to reproduce what exists, rather than to recommence the whole Creation at his own cost." </p><p>Occasionally, M. About pleases us by a bit of criticism more descriptive than usual, as in this on The Meet of the Ascot Hunt, by Grant:— </p><p>"Never, I think, has the science of painting surmounted a more insurmountable difficulty with more complete success. The problem was this:— Given, a flat country, fifty Englishmen in scarlet coats, fifty Englishmen in scarlet coats, fifty English dogs, and fifty English horses to make a picture which shall be neither monotonous, nor glaring, nor stupid, nor ridiculous. N. B. It is required that there should be a striking resemblance between the landscape, the men, the dogs, and the horses. With these data, Mr. Grant has produced a masterly work. The landscape is soft, delicate, moist; an imperceptible mist veils the background, without hidng it. The day will be pleasant, and it is a fine time for hunting. The huntsground, some on foot, some on horseback, chat silently, after the fashion of the country; they are waiting for the Queen. All the faces are evidently portraits; they resemble each other only in their healthiness and fine complexion—it is in this way that an Englishman always like an Englishman. The horses and dogs are thorough-bred. Animals and men, everything is painted with delicacy, with certainty, with minute strokes of the pencil, and yet with breadth. The scrupulous care for the details is merged in the harmony of the whole; and Mr. Grant is perhaps the first painter who out of a hundred and fifty portraits has been able to make a picture. What is, perhaps, not less admirable, is the art with which the painter has managed his colour. The public does not know how difficult it is to paint an assemblage of men in red coats. And, ye heavens, what red! Pure vermilionl Every one else, in Mr. Grant's place, would have made a thicket of lobsters. I do not know how he has managed, but what I can affirm is, that the coats are red and yet the picture is not red."</p><p>And sometimes M. About gives us a story à propos of a picture. For example:— </p><p>"The Turks sometimes allow themselves a fit of gaiety, as was the case with that Bey of Tunis, who made the fortune of a Marseillais. It is since this celebrated adventure that the Jews of Tunis wear cotton night-caps in the middle of the day. A Marseillais had the idea of importing cotton night-caps into the capital of the regency; accordingly, he took cargo of them on board his ship. Every Marseillais has a ship, as every snail has a shell. Arrived at Tunis, the officials at the port, to whom he had given no drink-money, prevented him from disembarking his merchandise. He waited patiently a month or two: at length he went to the Bey, and demanded zustice. 'What of justice do you wish me to render you?' said the Bey; 'French or Turkish?' 'French,' replied the Marseillais, proudly. 'Return, then, to your merchandise; I will let you have French justice.' A month afterwards the Marseillais had heard nothing, and the officials opposed themselves more resolutely than ever to his disembarkation. He returned to the Bey. 'Moussu le Bey,' said he, 'you promised to give me French justice.' 'What do you complain of? I have given you French justice.' 'O! O! I understand. Then, Moussu le Bey, let me have Turkish justice.' That very day the Bey published an edict enjoining all Jews to wear cotton night-caps, on pain of death. The people of Israel hurried to the vessel, and bought the cargo for its weight in gold. The Marseillais, become rich in the twinkling of an eye, came to thank his benefactor. "I have not finished,' said the Turk. 'You shall see whether I do things on a grand scale or not.' Without delay, he issued a decree condemning to death every Jew who should be convicted of wearing a cotton night-cap. The children of Jacob returned to the port, and paid the Marseillais to take back his cargo. But the legend adds, that they had had time to appreciate the softness, flexibility, and perhaps also the majest of this simple head-garb, and that they importuned the magistrates untile they were at last permitted to wear them." </p><p>Mr. Long, whose second volume of Cicero's Orations23 we gladly welcome, is an excellent specimen of the editor as he should be. He spares no pains, and makes no pretensions to infallibility; when he meets with a difficulty, he says so, and when he can keep his readers out of one, he does so, with brief and pregnant comments. Master of unusually large information in all matters relating to the laws, history, and customs of the classical writers, he makes no parade of it, and is as economical as he is accurate in his references. An inferior scholar would have produced a volume of twice the size of the one now before us, without affording half the instruction. And this reticence is the more valuable to the readers who will probably make most use of his edition of Cicero's Orations; for if all men feel a great book to be a great evil, to young men a long note is often an insuperable bar to the acquisition of knowledge.</p><p>The reader who shall thoroughly master the Orations contained in this volume may take credit to himself for having acquired by his pains a fund of information upon the internal and colonial history of Rome. For such information he will look in vain into any general histories of the Great Commonwealth. From these he may </p><p>indeed obtain a just conception of Cicero's career as a statesman, and of his power as an orator; since he will see the novus homo, against whom the avenues to high office were closed by the jealousy of the wealthy and the noble, forcing his way, without connexion and without the hearty support of any party, to the chair of the Consul and the leadership of the Senate. </p><p>But this is one phase only of Cicero's character. The opportunities for Catilinarian and Philippic orations come but rarely: they mark the epochs of Cicero's life: but they do not fill up the interstices of his unintermitting forensic labours. It was a maxim equally with the rising and the established orator to keep himself always before the eyes of the Roman people: by this pertinacity he came to eclipse his most formidable rival, Hortensius, and to depose the king of the Forum. Hortensius loved fame; but he loved ease also, the luxuries of his villa at Tusculum, the beautiful shadow of his plane-trees, his carp-ponds and his peacocks. Cicero, at least during two-thirds of his career, loved fame alone, and wooed her with an obstinacy equal to that of the miser or the lover. He was as deeply and constantly engaged in civil as in criminal cases, and took as much pains to recover for his clients the title of an estate, or the value of a bond or mortgage, as he bestowed in driving Verres into exile, or Lentulus and Cethegus to the Career Tullianum. </p><p>The Orations contained in Mr. Long's second volume may be divided into three heads—civil suits, provincial questions, and the lis litium in Roman history, the Agrarian law. The two latter sections are of permanent interest to the modern reader, since he may compare the Roman province of Asia with our Anglo-Indian </p><p>24 "M. Tulli Ciceronis Orationes." With a Commentary, by George Long. Vol. ii. 8vo. London: 1855. "Bibliotheca Classica." Vol. X. Whittaker and Bell. </p><p>empire, and the maintenance of paupers with the Roman provisions as regarded the public demesnes. The civil suits are necessarily less attractive, partly because they are more difficult to understand, and partly because the common law of England and the civil laws of Rome resemble each other in a few leading principles only, but differ widely in whatsoever concerns their practice and technology. </p><p>Yet whoever wishes to acquire just notions either of the practice of the Roman Courts, of the character of the Roman barrister, or of the particulars of Roman social economy, will do well to study, under Mr. Long's guidance, Cicero's pleas for Quintius, the Roscii, and especially the great and intricate speech in defence of Aulus Cluentius. In the Oratio pro P. Quintio he will find matter illustrative of the Roman law of partnership, and also the ancient manner of cooking accounts. The Romans did not entrust their public roads to companies of directors, but placed them under the charge of the senate and officials responsible to the Government. There were many men of business, however, in Rome in no respect inferior in the art of mismanagement to the most adroit of our railway boards. In the defence of Sextus Roscius of Ameria the reader will gain some insight into the internal character of Sulla's government. He will find that the external calm of Rome was the mask of gross corruption and cruelty, and that a freedman of Sulla's was little less formidable than the Narcissus and Polybius of the emperors. And this oration, the first of Cicero's in a publica causa, is the more interesting from the circumstances under which it was delivered, and the hardiness of the counsel for the defence. As against Chrysogonus, Sulla's potent favourite, all the elder advocates refused the brief; Cicero, then only twenty-seven years of age, accepted it; and in his old age refers with satisfaction to his youthful independence in bearding the plaintiff, "Contra Sullœ dominantis opes."</p><p>The revenues, administration, and produce of the "province Asia" supply Mr. Long with occasion for an excellent excursus on the Peru and Mexico of the Roman world. If Italy had the fatal gift of beauty, Asia under Rome had the no less fatal gift of wealth, and was the common arena for the bloodsuckers who farmed the revenues of the State, and for the capitalists who filled their own pockets. The worst provincial administration which modern Europe has ever seen is that of the American possessions of Spain, so long as they belonged to the mother country. But the oppressions of the viceroys of the Most Catholic kings must yield the palm to the extortions of the Roman procurators and publicani. Lastly—and perhaps as the most important portion of this volume, whether as regards the text or the comment, we direct the reader's attention to the Three Orations de Lege Agrariâ, and to the editor's introduction to them. No part of the economy of the Roman State has been more diligently explored than this: a living interest having been originally given to the question by the theories of Rousseau and the French Socialists of the day, on the Agrarian laws of Rome. Heyne was the first to demonstrate that an equal and infinitesimal division of land never entered into the mind of the most audacious of Roman levellers. Milo did clamour for an abolition of debts, and he had ample cause for desiring a clean slate; but not even Milo would have ventured to propose an abolition of existing landmarks. Even the mendicants of the Suburra would have hooted such a proposition. </p><p>In short compass and in clear manly language—the characteristic of Mr. Long's style—he has placed before his readers all the leading points of the great Agrarian controversy—a controversy which, under various shapes, pervades the whole history of the Commonwealth, and did not altogether cease with the Empire. Tiberius, Nero, and Trajan, the most sagacious, the most cruel, and the most humane of the emperors, were alike perplexed by the great pauper-swarm of their capital and provinces. Mr. Long's excursus maybe studied with advantage by every one who opens a volume of Roman annals at all, whether he begin with Livy, or with Zosimus and the Augustan historians. </p><p>It is needless for us to commend generally the series of the "Bibliotheca Classica," so far as its volumes have as yet appeared. It has received the sanction of both our Universities; and, as we happen to know, is highly prized by those for whom it is principally intended—the candidates for classical distinction. Horace, Herodotus, and Cicero have been rendered, through this series, more interesting to the scholar, and more intelligible to the general reader; and from the specimens already afforded of editorial learning, discretion, and skill, we are induced to bid good speed to the volumes which have appeared, and are prepared to welcome heartily those which are promised. </p><p>We have still to notice the continuation of Mr. Bohn's series, the "Classical Library" and the "British Library;" of the one by "Cicero on Oratory and Orators,"24 of the other, by a volume of De Foe, containing "The History of the Plague,"25 and by the fourth volume of "Burke's Works."26 The second volume of the "Noctes Ambrosianæ "27 has also appeared. In one of the conversations in this volume, De Quincey is introduced as an interlocutor, and his style is well imitated. Among the things he is made to say, it is curious to note this judgment, delivered à propos of Macaulay's well-known article on Southey's "Colloquies:"—"Mr. Southey is, beyond all doubt, one of the most illustrious, just as Mr. Macaulay is one of the most obscure men of the age." The "Noctes" are full of such reminders that "the whirligig of time brings about its revenges."</p><p>24 "Cicero on Oratory and Orators." Bohn's Classical Library. </p><p>25 "De Foe's Works." Vol. V.

The truth of this observation would perhaps have been more apparent if he had said culture instead of character. The last thing in which the cultivated man can have community with the vulgar is their jocularity; and we can hardly exhibit more strikingly the wide gulf which separates him from them, than by comparing the object which shakes the diaphragm of a coal-heaver with the highly complex pleasure derived from a real witticism. That any high order of wit is exceedingly complex, and demands a ripe and strong mental development, has one evidence in the fact that we do not find it in boys at all in proportion to their manifestation of other powers. Clever boys generally aspire to the heroic and poetic rather than the comic, and the crudest of all their efforts are their jokes. Many a witty man will remember how in his school days a practical joke, more or less Rabelaisian, was for him the ne plus ultra of the ludicrous. It seems to have been the same with the boyhood of the human race. The history and literature of the ancient Hebrews gives the idea of a people who went about their business and their pleasure as gravely as a society of beavers; the smile and the laugh are often mentioned metaphorically, but the smile is one of complacency, the laugh is one of scorn. Nor can we imagine that the facetious element was very strong in the Egyptians; no laughter lurks in the wondering eyes and the broad calm lips of their statues. Still less can the Assyrians have had any genius for the comic: the round eyes and simpering satisfaction of their ideal faces belong to a type which is not witty, but the cause of wit in others. The fun of these early races was, we fancy, of the after-dinner kind—loud-throated laughter over the wine-cup, taken too little account of in sober moments to enter as an element into their Art, and differing as much from the laughter of a Chamfort or a Sheridan as the gastronomic enjoyment of an ancient Briton, whose dinner had no other "removes" than from acorns to beechmast and back again to acorns, differed from the subtle pleasures of the palate experienced by his turtle-eating descendant. In fact they had to live seriously through the stages which to subsequent races were to become comedy, as those amiable-looking preadamite amphibia which Professor Owen has restored for us in effigy at Sydenham, took perfectly au sérieux the grotesque physiognomies of their kindred. Heavy experience in their case, as in every other, was the base from which the salt of future wit was to be made. </p><p>Humour is of earlier growth than Wit, and it is in accordance with this earlier growth that it has more affinity with the poetic tendencies, while Wit is more nearly allied to the ratiocinative intellect. Humour draws its materials from situations and characteristics; Wit seizes on unexpected and complex relations. Humour is chiefly representative and descriptive; it is diffuse, and flows along without any other law than its own fantastic will; or it flits about like a will-of-the-wisp, amazing us by its whimsical transitions. Wit is brief and sudden, and sharply defined as a crystal; it does not make pictures, it is not fantastic; but it detects an unsuspected analogy or suggests a startling or confounding inference. Every one who has had the opportunity of making the comparison will remember that the effect produced on him by some witticisms is closely akin to the effect produced on him by subtle reasoning which lays open a fallacy or absurdity, and there are persons whose delight in such reasoning always manifests itself in laughter. This affinity of Wit with ratiocination is the more obvious in proportion as the species of wit is higher and deals less with less words and with superficialities than with the essential qualities of things. Some of Johnson's most admirable witticisms consist in the suggestion of an analogy which immediately exposes the absurdity of an action or proposition; and it is only their ingenuity, condensation, and instantaneousness which lift them from reasoning into Wit—they are reasoning raised to a higher power. On the other hand, Humour, in its higher forms, and in proportion as it associates itself with the sympathetic emotions, continually passes into poetry: nearly all great modern humorists may be called prose poets.</p><p>Some confusion as to the nature of Humour has been created by the fact, that those who have written most eloquently on it have dwelt almost exclusively on its higher forms, and have defined humour in general as the sympathetic presentation of incongruous elements in human nature and life; a definition which only applies to its later development. A great deal of humour may co-exist with a great deal of barbarism, as we see in the Middle Ages; but the strongest flavour of the humour in such cases will come, not from sympathy, but more probably from triumphant egoism or intolerance; at best it will be the love of the ludicrous exhibiting itself in illustrations of successful cunning and of the lex talionis as in Reineke Fuchs, or shaking off in a holiday mood the yoke of a too exacting faith, as in the old Mysteries. Again, it is impossible to deny a high degree of humour to many practical jokes, but no sympathetic nature can enjoy them. Strange as the genealogy may seem, the original parentage of that wonderful and delicious mixture of fun, fancy, philosophy, and feeling, which constitutes modern humour, was probably the cruel mockery of a savage at the writhings of a suffering enemy—such is the tendency of things toward the good and beautiful on this earth! Probably the reason why high culture demands more complete harmony with its moral sympathies in humour than in wit, is that humour is in its nature more prolix—that it has not the direct and irresistible force of wit. Wit is an electric shock, which takes us by violence, quite independently of our predominant mental disposition; but humour approaches us more deliberately and leaves us masters of ourselves. Hence it is, that while coarse and cruel humour has almost disappeared from contemporary literature, coarse and cruel wit abounds; even refined men cannot help laughing at a coarse bon mot or a lacerating personality, if the "shock" of the witticism is a powerful one; while mere fun will have no power over them if it jar on their moral taste. Hence, too, it is, that while wit is perennial, humour is liable to become superannuated. </p><p>As is usual with definitions and classifications, however, this distinction between wit and humour does not exactly represent the actual fact. Like all other species, Wit and Humour overlap and blend with each other. There are bon mots, like many of Charles Lamb's, which are a sort of facetious hybrids, we hardly know whether to call them witty or humorous; there are rather lengthy descriptions or narratives, which, like Voltaire's "Micromégas," would be more humorous if they were not so sparkling and antithetic, so pregnant with suggestion and satire, that we are obliged to call them witty. We rarely find wit untempered by humour, or humour without a spice of wit; and sometimes we find them both united in the highest degree in the same mind, as in Shakespeare and Molière. A happy conjunction this, for wit is apt to be cold, and thin-lipped, and Mephistophelean in men who have no relish for humour, whose lungs do never crow like Chanticleer at fun and drollery; and broad-faced, rollicking humour needs the refining influence of wit. Indeed, it may be said that there is no really fine writing in which wit has not an implicit, if not an explicit, action. The wit may never rise to the surface, it may never flame out into a witticism; but it helps to give brightness and transparency, it warns off from flights and exaggerations which verge on the ridiculous—in every genre of writing it preserves a man from sinking into the genre ennuyeux. And it is eminently needed for this office in humourous writing; for as humour has no limits imposed on it by its material, no law but its own exuberance, it is apt to become preposterous and wearisome unless checked by wit, which is the enemy of all monotony, of all lengthiness, of all exaggeration.</p><p>Perhaps the nearest approach Nature has given us to a complete analysis, in which wit is as thoroughly exhausted of humour as possible, and humour as bare as possible of wit, is in the typical Frenchman and the typical German. Voltaire, the intensest example of pure wit, fails in most of his fictions from his lack of humour. Micromégas is a perfect tale, because, as it deals chiefly with philosophic ideas and does not touch the marrow of human feeling and life, the writer's wit and wisdom were all-sufficient for his purpose. Not so with Candide. Here Voltaire had to give pictures of life as well as to convey philosophic truth and satire, and here we feel the want of humour. The sense of the ludicrous is continually defeated by disgust, and the scenes, instead of presenting us with an amusing or agreeable picture, are only the frame for a witticism. On the other hand, German humour generally shows no sense of measure, no instinctive tact; it is either floundering and clumsy as the antics of a leviathan, or laborious and interminable as a Lapland day, in which one loses all hope that the stars and quiet will ever come. For this reason, Jean Paul, the greatest of German humorists, is unendurable to many readers, and frequently tiresome to all. Here, as elsewhere, the German shows the absence of that delicate perception, that sensibility to gradation, which is the essence of tact and taste, and the necessary concomitant of wit. All his subtlety is reserved for the region of metaphysics. For Identität in the abstract, no one can have an acuter vision, but in the concrete he is satisfied with a very loose approximation. He has the finest nose for Empirismus in philosophical doctrine, but the presence of more or less tobacco smoke in the air he breathes is imperceptible to him. To the typical German—Vetter Michel—it is indifferent whether his door-lock will catch, whether his tea-cup be more or less than an inch thick; whether or not his book have every other leaf unstitched; whether his neighbor's conversation be more or less of a shout; whether he pronounce b or p, t or d; whether or not his adored one's teeth be few and far between. He has the same sort of insensibility to gradations in time. A German comedy is like a German sentence: you see no reason in its structure why it should ever come to an end, and you accept the conclusion as an arrangement of Providence rather than of the author. We have heard Germans use the word Langeweile, the equivalent for ennui, and we have secretly wondered what it can be that produces ennui in a German. Not the longest of long tragedies, for we have known him to pronounce that höchst fesselnd (so enchaining!); not the heaviest of heavy books, for he delights in that as gründlich (deep, Sir, deep!); not the slowest of journeys in a Post-wagen, for the slower the horses, the more cigars he can smoke before he reaches his journey's end. German ennui must be something as superlative as Barclay's treble X, which, we suppose, implies an extremely unknown quantity of stupefaction. </p><p>It is easy to see that this national deficiency in nicety of perception must have its effect on the national appreciation and exhibition of Humour. You find in Germany ardent admirers of Shakespeare, who tell you that what they think most admirable in him is his Wortspiel, his verbal quibbles; and one of these, a man of no slight culture and refinement, once cited to a friend of ours Proteus's joke in "The Two Gentlemen of Verona"—"Nod I? why that's Noddy," as a transcendant specimen of Shakespearian wit. German facetiousness is seldom comic to foreigners, and an Englishman with a swelled cheek might take up Kladderadatsch, the German Punch, without any danger of agitating his facial muscles. Indeed, it is a remarkable fact that, among the five great races concerned in modern civilization, the German race is the only one which, up to the present century, had contributed nothing classic to the common stock of European wit and humour; for Reineke Fuchs cannot be regarded as a peculiarly Teutonic product. Italy was the birthplace of Pantomime and the immortal Pulcinello; Spain had produced Cervantes; France had produced Rabelais and Molière, and classic wits innumerable; England had yielded Shakspeare and a host of humorists. But Germany had borne no great comic dramatist, no great Satirist, and she has not yet repaired the omission; she had not even produced any humorist of a high order. Among her great writers, Lessing is the one who is the most specifically witty. We feel the implicit influence of wit—the "flavor of mind"—throughout his writings; and it is often concentrated into pungent satire, as every reader of the Hamburgische Dramaturgie remembers. Still Lessing's name has not become European through his wit, and his charming comedy, "Minna von Barnhelm," has won no place on a foreign stage. Of course we do not pretend to an exhaustive acquaintance with German literature; we not only admit—we are sure, that it includes much comic writing of which we know nothing. We simply state the fact, that no German production of that kind, before the present century, ranked as European; a fact which does not, indeed, determine the amount of the national facetiousness, but which is quite decisive as to its quality. Whatever may be the stock of fun which Germany yields for home consumption, she has provided little for the palate of other lands. All honor to her for the still greater things she has done for us! She has fought the hardest fight for freedom of thought, has produced the grandest inventions, has made magnificent contributions to science, has given us some of the divinest poetry, and quite the divinest music, in the world. No one reveres and treasures the products of the German mind more than we do. To say that that mind is not fertile in wit, is only like saying that excellent wheat land is not rich pasture; to say that we do not enjoy German facetiousness, is no more than to say, that though the horse is the finest of quadrupeds, we do not like him to lay his hoof playfully on our shoulder. Still, as we have noticed that the pointless puns and stupid jocularity of the boy may ultimately be developed into the epigrammatic brilliancy and polished playfulness of the man; as we believe that racy wit and chastened delicate humour are inevitably the results of invigorated and refined mental activity; we can also believe that Germany will, one day, yield a crop of wits and humorists.</p><p>Perhaps there is already an earnest of that future crop in the existence of HEINRICH HEINE, a German born with the present century, who, to Teutonic imagination, sensibility, and humour, adds an amount of esprit that would make him brilliant among the most brilliant of Frenchmen. True, this unique German wit is half a Hebrew; but he and his ancestors spent their youth in German air, and were reared on Wurst and Sauerkraut, so that he is as much a German as a pheasant is an English bird, or a potato an Irish vegetable. But whatever else he may be, Heine is one of the most remarkable men of this age: no echo, but a real voice, and therefore, like all genuine things in this world, worth studying; a surpassing lyric poet, who has uttered our feelings for us in delicious song; a humorist, who touches leaden folly with the magic wand of his fancy, and transmutes it into the fine gold of art—who sheds his sunny smile on human tears, and makes them a beauteous rainbow on the cloudy background of life; a wit, who holds in his mighty hand the most scorching lightnings of satire; an artist in prose literature, who has shown even more completely than Goethe the possibilities of German prose; and—in spite of all charges against him, true as well as false—a lover of freedom, who has spoken wise and brave words on behalf of his fellow-men. He is, moreover, a suffering man, who, with all the highly-wrought sensibility of genius, has to endure terrible physical ills; and as such he calls forth more than an intellectual interest. It is true, alas! that there is a heavy weight in the other scale—that Heine's magnificent powers have often served only to give electric force to the expression of debased feeling, so that his works are no Phidian statue of gold, and ivory, and gems, but have not a little brass, and iron, and miry clay mingled with the precious metal. The audacity of his occasional coarseness and personality is unparalleled in contemporary literature, and has hardly been exceeded by the license of former days. Hence, before his volumes are put within the reach of immature minds, there is need of a friendly penknife to exercise a strict censorship. Yet, when all coarseness, all scurrility, all Mephistophelean contempt for the reverent feelings of other men, is removed, there will be a plenteous remainder of exquisite poetry, of wit, humour, and just thought. It is apparently too often a congenial task to write severe words about the transgressions committed by men of genius, especially when the censor has the advantage of being himself a man of no genius, so that those transgressions seem to him quite gratuitous; he, forsooth, never lacerated any one by his wit, or gave irresistible piquancy to a coarse allusion, and his indignation is not mitigated by any knowledge of the temptation that lies in transcendent power. We are also apt to measure what a gifted man has done by our arbitrary conception of what he might have done, rather than by a comparison of his actual doings with our own or those of other ordinary men. We make ourselves over-zealous agents of heaven, and demand that our brother should bring usurious interest for his five Talents, forgetting that it is less easy to manage five Talents than two. Whatever benefit there may be in denouncing the evil, it is after all more edifying, and certainly more cheering, to appreciate the good. Hence, in endeavoring to give our readers some account of Heine and his works, we shall not dwell lengthily on his failings; we shall not hold the candle up to dusty, vermin-haunted corners, but let the light fall as much as possible on the nobler and more attractive details. Our sketch of Heine's life, which has been drawn from various sources, will be free from everything like intrusive gossip, and will derive its coloring chiefly from the autobiographical hints and descriptions scattered through his own writings. Those of our readers who happen to know nothing of Heine, will in this way be making their acquaintance with the writer while they are learning the outline of his career.</p><p>We have said that Heine was born with the present century; but this statement is not precise, for we learn that, according to his certificate of baptism, he was born December 12th, 1799. However, as he himself says, the important point is, that he was born, and born on the banks of the Rhine, at Dusseldorf, where his father was a merchant. In his "Reisebilder" he gives us some recollections, in his wild poetic way, of the dear old town where he spent his childhood, and of his schoolboy troubles there. We shall quote from these in butterfly fashion, sipping a little nectar here and there, without regard to any strict order:— </p><p>"I first saw the light on the banks of that lovely stream, where Folly grows on the green hills, and in autumn is plucked, pressed, poured into casks, and sent into foreign lands. Believe me, I yesterday heard some one utter folly which, in anno 1811, lay in a bunch of grapes I then saw growing on the Johannisberg. . . . Mon Dieu! if I had only such faith in me that I could remove mountains, the Johannisberg would be the very mountain I should send for wherever I might be; but as my faith is not so strong, imagination must help me, and it transports me at once to the lovely Rhine. . . . I am again a child, and playing with other children on the Schlossplatz, at Düsseldorf on the Rhine. Yes, madam, there was I born; and I note this expressly, in case, after my death, seven cities—Schilda, Krähwinkel, Polkwitz, Bockum, Dülken, Göttingen, and Schöppenstädt—should contend for the honor of being my birthplace. Düsseldorf is a town on the Rhine; sixteen thousand men live there, and many hundred thousand men besides lie buried there. . . . . Among them, many of whom my mother says, that it would be better if they were still living; for example, my grandfather and my uncle, the old Herr von Geldern and the young Herr von Geldern, both such celebrated doctors, who saved so many men from death, and yet must die themselves. And the pious Ursula, who carried me in her arms when I was a child, also lies buried there and a rosebush grows on her grave; she loved the scent of roses so well in life, and her heart was pure rose-incense and goodness. The knowing old Canon, too, lies buried there. Heavens, what an object he looked when I last saw him! He was made up of nothing but mind and plasters, and nevertheless studied day and night, as if he were alarmed lest the worms should find an idea too little in his head. And the little William lies there, and for this I am to blame. We were schoolfellows in the Franciscan monastery, and were playing on that side of it where the Düssel flows between stone walls, and I said, ‘William, fetch out the kitten that has just fallen in'—and merrily he went down on to the plank which lay across the brook, snatched the kitten out of the water, but fell in himself, and was dragged out dripping and dead. The kitten lived to a good old age. . . . Princes in that day were not the tormented race as they are now; the crown grew firmly on their heads, and at night they drew a nightcap over it, and slept peacefully, and peacefully slept the people at their feet; and when the people waked in the morning, they said, ‘Good morning, father!' and the princes answered, ‘Good morning, dear children!' But it was suddenly quite otherwise; for when we awoke one morning at Düsseldorf, and were ready to say, ‘Good morning, father!' lo! the father was gone away; and in the whole town there was nothing but dumb sorrow, everywhere a sort of funeral disposition; and people glided along silently to the market, and read the long placard placed on the door of the Town Hall. It was dismal weather; yet the lean tailor, Kilian, stood in his nankeen jacket which he usually wore only in the house, and his blue worsted stockings hung down so that his naked legs peeped out mournfully, and his thin lips trembled while he muttered the announcement to himself. And an old soldier read rather louder, and at many a word a crystal tear trickled down to his brave old mustache. I stood near him and wept in company, and asked him, ‘Why we wept?' He answered, ‘The Elector has abdicated.' And then he read again, and at the words, ‘for the long-manifested fidelity of my subjects,' and ‘hereby set you free from your allegiance,' he wept more than ever. It is strangely touching to see an old man like that, with faded uniform and scarred face, weep so bitterly all of a sudden. While we were reading, the electoral arms were taken down from the Town Hall; everything had such a desolate air, that it was as if an eclipse of the sun were expected. . . . I went home and wept, and wailed out, ‘The Elector has abdicated!' In vain my mother took a world of trouble to explain the thing to me. I knew what I knew; I was not to be persuaded, but went crying to bed, and in the night dreamed that the world was at an end."</p><p>The next morning, however, the sun rises as usual, and Joachim Murat is proclaimed Grand Duke, whereupon there is a holiday at the public school, and Heinrich (or Harry, for that was his baptismal name, which he afterward had the good taste to change), perched on the bronze horse of the Electoral statue, sees quite a different scene from yesterday's:— </p><p>"The next day the world was again all in order, and we had school as before, and things were got by heart as before—the Roman emperors, chronology, the nouns in im, the verba irregularia, Greek, Hebrew, geography, mental arithmetic!—heavens! my head is still dizzy with it—all must be learned by heart! And a great deal of this came very conveniently for me in after life. For if I had not known the Roman kings by heart, it would subsequently have been quite indifferent to me whether Niebuhr had proved or had not proved that they never really existed. . . . But oh! the trouble I had at school with the endless dates. And with arithmetic it was still worse. What I understood best was subtraction, for that has a very practical rule: ‘Four can't be taken from three, therefore I must borrow one.' But I advise every one in such a case to borrow a few extra pence, for no one can tell what may happen. . . . As for Latin, you have no idea, madam, what a complicated affair it is. The Romans would never have found time to conquer the world if they had first had to learn Latin. Luckily for them, they already knew in their cradles what nouns have their accusative in im. I, on the contrary, had to learn them by heart in the sweat of my brow; nevertheless, it is fortunate for me that I know them . . . and the fact that I have them at my finger-ends if I should ever happen to want them suddenly, affords me much inward repose and consolation in many troubled hours of life. . . . Of Greek I will not say a word, I should get too much irritated. The monks in the Middle Ages were not so far wrong when they maintained that Greek was an invention of the devil. God knows the suffering I endured over it. . . . With Hebrew it went somewhat better, for I had always a great liking for the Jews, though to this very hour they crucify my good name; but I could never get on so far in Hebrew as my watch, which had much familiar intercourse with pawnbrokers, and in this way contracted many Jewish habits—for example, it wouldn't go on Saturdays."</p><p>Heine's parents were apparently not wealthy, but his education was cared for by his uncle, Solomon Heine, a great banker in Hamburg, so that he had no early pecuniary disadvantages to struggle with. He seems to have been very happy in his mother, who was not of Hebrew but of Teutonic blood; he often mentions her with reverence and affection, and in the "Buch der Lieder" there are two exquisite sonnets addressed to her, which tell how his proud spirit was always subdued by the charm of her presence, and how her love was the home of his heart after restless weary ramblings:— </p><p>"Wie mächtig auch mein stolzer Muth sich blähe, </p><p>In deiner selig süssen, trauten Nahe </p><p>Ergreift mich oft ein demuthvolles Zagen. </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>Und immer irrte ich nach Liebe, immer </p><p>Nach Liebe, doch die Liebe fand ich nimmer, </p><p>Und kehrte um nach Hause, krank und trübe. </p><p>Doch da bist du entgegen mir gekommen, </p><p>Und ach! was da in deinem Aug' geschwommen, </p><p>Das war die süsse, langgesuchte Liebe." </p><p>He was at first destined for a mercantile life, but Nature declared too strongly against this plan. "God knows," he has lately said in conversation with his brother, "I would willingly have become a banker, but I could never bring myself to that pass. I very early discerned that bankers would one day be the rulers of the world." So commerce was at length given up for law, the study of which he began in 1819 at the University of Bonn. He had already published some poems in the corner of a newspaper, and among them was one on Napoleon, the object of his youthful enthusiasm. This poem, he says in a letter to St. René Taillandier, was written when he was only sixteen. It is still to be found in the "Buch der Lieder" under the title "Die Grenadiere," and it proves that even in its earliest efforts his genius showed a strongly specific character. </p><p>It will be easily imagined that the germs of poetry sprouted too vigorously in Heine's brain for jurisprudence to find much room there. Lectures on history and literature, we are told, were more diligently attended than lectures on law. He had taken care, too, to furnish his trunk with abundant editions of the poets, and the poet he especially studied at that time was Byron. At a later period, we find his taste taking another direction, for he writes, "Of all authors, Byron is precisely the one who excites in me the most intolerable emotion; whereas Scott, in every one of his works, gladdens my heart, soothes, and invigorates me." Another indication of his bent in these Bonn days was a newspaper essay, in which he attacked the Romantic school; and here also he went through that chicken-pox of authorship—the production of a tragedy. Heine's tragedy—"Almansor"—is, as might be expected, better than the majority of these youthful mistakes. The tragic collision lies in the conflict between natural affection and the deadly hatred of religion and of race—in the sacrifice of youthful lovers to the strife between Moor and Spaniard, Moslem and Christian. Some of the situations are striking, and there are passages of considerable poetic merit; but the characters are little more than shadowy vehicles for the poetry, and there is a want of clearness and probability in the structure. It was published two years later, in company with another tragedy, in one act, called "William Ratcliffe," in which there is rather a feeble use of the Scotch second-sight after the manner of the Fate in the Greek tragedy. We smile to find Heine saying of his tragedies, in a letter to a friend soon after their publication: "I know they will be terribly cut up, but I will confess to you in confidence that they are very good, better than my collection of poems, which are not worth a shot." Elsewhere he tells us, that when, after one of Paganini's concerts, he was passionately complimenting the great master on his violin-playing, Paganini interrupted him thus: "But how were you pleased with my bows?"</p><p>In 1820 Heine left Bonn for Göttingen. He there pursued his omission of law studies; and at the end of three months he was rusticated for a breach of the laws against duelling. While there, he had attempted a negotiation with Brockhaus for the printing of a volume of poems, and had endured the first ordeal of lovers and poets—a refusal. It was not until a year after that he found a Berlin publisher for his first volume of poems, subsequently transformed, with additions, into the "Buch der Lieder." He remained between two and three years at Berlin, and the society he found there seems to have made these years an important epoch in his culture. He was one of the youngest members of a circle which assembled at the house of the poetess Elise von Hohenhausen, the translator of Byron—a circle which included Chamisso, Varnhagen, and Rahel (Varnhagen's wife). For Rahel, Heine had a profound admiration and regard; he afterward dedicated to her the poems included under the tide "Heimkehr;" and he frequently refers to her or quotes her in a way that indicates how he valued her influence. According to his friend, F. von Hohenhausen, the opinions concerning Heine's talent were very various among his Berlin friends, and it was only a small minority that had any presentiment of his future fame. In this minority was Elise von Hohenhausen, who proclaimed Heine as the Byron of Germany; but her opinion was met with much head-shaking and opposition. We can imagine how precious was such a recognition as hers to the young poet, then only two or three and twenty, and with by no means an impressive personality for superficial eyes. Perhaps even the deep-sighted were far from detecting in that small, blonde, pale young man, with quiet, gentle manners, the latent powers of ridicule and sarcasm—the terrible talons that were one day to be thrust out from the velvet paw of the young leopard. </p><p>It was apparently during this residence in Berlin that Heine united himself with the Lutheran Church. He would willingly, like many of his friends, he tells us, have remained free from all ecclesiastical ties if the authorities there had not forbidden residence in Prussia, and especially in Berlin, to every one who did not belong to one of the positive religions recognized by the State. </p><p>"As Henry IV. once laughingly said, ‘Paris vaut bien une messe,' so I might with reason say, ‘Berlin vaut bien une prêche;' and I could afterward, as before, accommodate myself to the very enlightened Christianity, filtrated from all superstition, which could then be had in the churches of Berlin, and which was even free from the divinity of Christ, like turtle-soup without turtle." </p><p>At the same period, too, Heine became acquainted with Hegel. In his lately published "Geständnisse" (Confessions), he throws on Hegel's influence over him the blue light of demoniacal wit, and confounds us by the most bewildering double-edged sarcasms; but that influence seems to have been at least more wholesome than the one which produced the mocking retractations of the "Geständnisse." Through all his self-satire, we discern that in those days he had something like real earnestness and enthusiasm, which are certainly not apparent in his present theistic confession of faith.</p><p>"On the whole, I never felt a strong enthusiasm for this philosophy, and conviction on the subject was out of question. I never was an abstract thinker, and I accepted the synthesis of the Hegelian doctrine without demanding any proof; since its consequences flattered my vanity. I was young and proud, and it pleased my vainglory when I learned from Hegel that the true God was not, as my grandmother believed, the God who lives in heaven, but myself here upon earth. This foolish pride had not in the least a pernicious influence on my feelings; on the contrary, it heightened these to the pitch of heroism. I was at that time so lavish in generosity and self-sacrifice that I must assuredly have eclipsed the most brilliant deeds of those good bourgeois of virtue who acted merely from a sense of duty, and simply obeyed the laws of morality." </p><p>His sketch of Hegel is irresistibly amusing; but we must warn the reader that Heine's anecdotes are often mere devices of style by which he conveys his satire or opinions. The reader will see that he does not neglect an opportunity of giving a sarcastic lash or two, in passing, to Meyerbeer, for whose music he has a great contempt. The sarcasm conveyed in the substitution of reputation for music and journalists for musicians, might perhaps escape any one unfamiliar with the sly and unexpected turns of Heine's ridicule. </p><p>"To speak frankly, I seldom understood him, and only arrived at the meaning of his words by subsequent reflection. I believe he wished not to be understood; and hence his practice of sprinkling his discourse with modifying parentheses; hence, perhaps, his preference for persons of whom he knew that they did not understand him, and to whom he all the more willingly granted the honor of his familiar acquaintance. Thus every one in Berlin wondered at the intimate companionship of the profound Hegel with the late Heinrich Beer, a brother of Giacomo Meyerbeer, who is universally known by his reputation, and who has been celebrated by the cleverest journalists. This Beer, namely Heinrich, was a thoroughly stupid fellow, and indeed was afterward actually declared imbecile by his family, and placed under guardianship, because instead of making a name for himself in art or in science by means of his great fortune, he squandered his money on childish trifles; and, for example, one day bought six thousand thalers' worth of walking-sticks. This poor man, who had no wish to pass either for a great tragic dramatist, or for a great star-gazer, or for a laurel-crowned musical genius, a rival of Mozart and Rossini, and preferred giving his money for walking-sticks—this degenerate Beer enjoyed Hegel's most confidential society; he was the philosopher's bosom friend, his Pylades, and accompanied him everywhere like his shadow. The equally witty and gifted Felix Mendelssohn once sought to explain this phenomenon, by maintaining that Hegel did not understand Heinrich Beer. I now believe, however, that the real ground of that intimacy consisted in this—Hegel was convinced that no word of what he said was understood by Heinrich Beer; and he could therefore, in his presence, give himself up to all the intellectual outpourings of the moment. In general, Hegel's conversation was a sort of monologue, sighed forth by starts in a noiseless voice; the odd roughness of his expressions often struck me, and many of them have remained in my memory. One beautiful starlight evening we stood together at the window, and I, a young man of one-and-twenty, having just had a good dinner and finished my coffee, spoke with enthusiasm of the stars, and called them the habitations of the departed. But the master muttered to himself, ‘The stars! hum! hum! The stars are only a brilliant leprosy on the face of the heavens.' ‘For God's sake,' I cried, ‘is there, then, no happy place above, where virtue is rewarded after death?' But he, staring at me with his pale eyes, said, cuttingly, ‘So you want a bonus for having taken care of your sick mother, and refrained from poisoning your worthy brother?' At these words he looked anxiously round, but appeared immediately set at rest when he observed that it was only Heinrich Beer, who had approached to invite him to a game at whist."</p><p>In 1823, Heine returned to Göttingen to complete his career as a law-student, and this time he gave evidence of advanced mental maturity, not only by producing many of the charming poems subsequently included in the "Reisebilder," but also by prosecuting his professional studies diligently enough to leave Göttingen, in 1825, as Doctor juris. Hereupon he settled at Hamburg as an advocate, but his profession seems to have been the least pressing of his occupations. In those days a small blonde young man, with the brim of his hat drawn over his nose, his coat flying open, and his hands stuck in his trousers pockets, might be seen stumbling along the streets of Hamburg, staring from side to side, and appearing to have small regard to the figure he made in the eyes of the good citizens. Occasionally an inhabitant more literary than usual would point out this young man to his companion as Heinrich Heine; but in general the young poet had not to endure the inconveniences of being a lion. His poems were devoured, but he was not asked to devour flattery in return. Whether because the fair Hamburgers acted in the spirit of Johnson's advice to Hannah More—to "consider what her flattery was worth before she choked him with it"—or for some other reason, Heine, according to the testimony of August Lewald, to whom we owe these particulars of his Hamburg life, was left free from the persecution of tea-parties. Not, however, from another persecution of Genius—nervous headaches, which some persons, we are told, regarded as an improbable fiction, intended as a pretext for raising a delicate white hand to his forehead. It is probable that the sceptical persons alluded to were themselves untroubled with nervous headaches, and that their hands were not delicate. Slight details these, but worth telling about a man of genius, because they help us to keep in mind that he is, after all, our brother, having to endure the petty everyday ills of life as we have; with this difference, that his heightened sensibility converts what are mere insect stings for us into scorpion stings for him. </p><p>It was, perhaps, in these Hamburg days that Heine paid the visit to Goethe, of which he gives us this charming little picture:— </p><p>"When I visited him in Weimar, and stood before him, I involuntarily glanced at his side to see whether the eagle was not there with the lightning in his beak. I was nearly speaking Greek to him; but, as I observed that he understood German, I stated to him in German that the plums on the road between Jena and Weimar were very good. I had for so many long winter nights thought over what lofty and profound things I would say to Goethe, if ever I saw him. And when I saw him at last, I said to him, that the Saxon plums were very good! And Goethe smiled." </p><p>During the next few years Heine produced the most popular of all his works—those which have won him his place as the greatest of living German poets and humorists. Between 1826 and 1829 appeared the four volumes of the "Reisebilder" (Pictures of Travel) and the "Buch der Lieder" (Book of Songs)—a volume of lyrics, of which it is hard to say whether their greatest charm is the lightness and finish of their style, their vivid and original imaginativeness, or their simple, pure sensibility. In his "Reisebilder," Heine carries us with him to the Harz, to the isle of Norderney, to his native town Dusseldorf, to Italy, and to England, sketching scenery and character, now with the wildest, most fantastic humour, now with the finest idyllic sensibility—letting his thoughts wander from poetry to politics, from criticism to dreamy reverie, and blending fun, imagination, reflection, and satire in a sort of exquisite, ever-varying shimmer, like the hues of the opal. </p><p>Heine's journey to England did not at all heighten his regard for the English. He calls our language the "hiss of egoism" (Zischlaute des Egoismus); and his ridicule of English awkwardness is as merciless as—English ridicule of German awkwardness. His antipathy towards us seems to have grown in intensity, like many of his other antipathies; and in his "Vermischte Schriften" he is more bitter than ever. Let us quote one of his philippics; since bitters are understood to be wholesome.</p><p>"It is certainly a frightful injustice to pronounce sentence of condemnation on an entire people. But with regard to the English, momentary disgust might betray me into this injustice; and on looking at the mass I easily forget the many brave and noble men who distinguished themselves by intellect and love of freedom. But these, especially the British poets, were always all the more glaringly in contrast with the rest of the nation; they were isolated martyrs to their national relations; and, besides, great geniuses do not belong to the particular land of their birth: they scarcely belong to this earth, the Golgotha of their sufferings. The mass—the English blockheads, God forgive me!—are hateful to me in my inmost soul; and I often regard them not at all as my fellow-men, but as miserable automata—machines, whose motive power is egoism. In these moods, it seems to me as if I heard the whizzing wheelwork by which they think, feel, reckon, digest, and pray: their praying, their mechanical Anglican church-going, with the gilt Prayer-book under their arms, their stupid, tiresome Sunday, their awkward piety, is most of all odious to me. I am firmly convinced that a blaspheming Frenchman is a more pleasing sight for the Divinity than a praying Englishman." </p><p>On his return from England, Heine was employed at Munich in editing the Allgemeinen Politischen Annalen, but in 1830 he was again in the north, and the news of the July Revolution surprised him on the island of Heligoland. He has given us a graphic picture of his democratic enthusiasm in those days in some letters, apparently written from Heligoland, which he has inserted in his book on Börne. We quote some passages, not only for their biographic interest as showing a phase of Heine's mental history, but because they are a specimen of his power in that kind of dithyrambic writing which, in less masterly hands, easily becomes ridiculous:— </p><p>"The thick packet of newspapers arrived from the Continent with these warm, glowing-hot tidings. They were sunbeams wrapped up in packing-paper, and they inflamed my soul till it burst into the wildest conflagration. . . . It is all like a dream to me; especially the name Lafayette sounds to me like a legend out of my earliest childhood. Does he really sit again on horseback, commanding the National Guard? I almost fear it may not be true, for it is in print. I will myself go to Paris, to be convinced of it with my bodily eyes. . . . It must be splendid, when he rides through the street, the citizen of two worlds, the godlike old man, with his silver locks streaming down his sacred shoulder. . . . He greets, with his dear old eyes, the grandchildren of those who once fought with him for freedom and equality. . . . It is now sixty years since he returned from America with the Declaration of Human Rights, the decalogue of the world's new creed, which was revealed to him amid the thunders and lightnings of cannon. . . . And the tricolored flag waves again on the towers of Paris, and its streets resound with the Marseillaise! . . . It is all over with my yearning for repose. I now know again what I will do, what I ought to do, what I must do. . . . I am the son of the Revolution, and seize again the hallowed weapons on which my mother pronounced her magic benediction. . . . Flowers! flowers! I will crown my head for the death-fight. And the lyre too, reach me the lyre, that I may sing a battle-song. . . . Words like flaming stars, that shoot down from the heavens, and burn up the palaces, and illuminate the huts. . . . Words like bright javelins, that whirr up to the seventh heaven and strike the pious hypocrites who have skulked into the Holy of Holies. . . . I am all joy and song, all sword and flame! Perhaps, too, all delirium. . . . One of those sunbeams wrapped in brown paper has flown to my brain, and set my thoughts aglow. In vain I dip my head into the sea. No water extinguishes this Greek fire: . . . Even the poor Heligolanders shout for joy, although they have only a sort of dim instinct of what has occurred. The fisherman who yesterday took me over to the little sand island, which is the bathing-place here, said to me smilingly, ‘The poor people have won!' Yes; instinctively the people comprehend such events, perhaps, better than we, with all our means of knowledge. Thus Frau von Varnhagen once told me that when the issue of the Battle of Leipzig was not yet known, the maid-servant suddenly rushed into the room with the sorrowful cry, ‘The nobles have won!' . . . This morning another packet of newspapers is come, I devour them like manna. Child that I am, affecting details touch me yet more than the momentous whole. Oh, if I could but see the dog Medor. . . . The dog Medor brought his master his gun and cartridge-box, and when his master fell, and was buried with his fellow-heroes in the Court of the Louvre, there stayed the poor dog like a monument of faithfulness, sitting motionless on the grave, day and night, eating but little of the food that was offered him—burying the greater part of it in the earth, perhaps as nourishment for his buried master!"</p><p>The enthusiasm which was kept thus at boiling heat by imagination, cooled down rapidly when brought into contact with reality. In the same book he indicates, in his caustic way, the commencement of that change in his political temperature—for it cannot be called a change in opinion—which has drawn down on him immense vituperation from some of the patriotic party, but which seems to have resulted simply from the essential antagonism between keen wit and fanaticism. </p><p>"On the very first days of my arrival in Paris I observed that things wore, in reality, quite different colors from those which had been shed on them, when in perspective, by the light of my enthusiasm. The silver locks which I saw fluttering so majestically on the shoulders of Lafayette, the hero of two worlds, were metamorphosed into a brown perruque, which made a pitiable covering for a narrow skull. And even the dog Medor, which I visited in the Court of the Louvre, and which, encamped under tricolored flags and trophies, very quietly allowed himself to be fed—he was not at all the right dog, but quite an ordinary brute, who assumed to himself merits not his own, as often happens with the French; and, like many others, he made a profit out of the glory of the Revolution. . . . He was pampered and patronized, perhaps promoted to the highest posts, while the true Medor, some days after the battle, modestly slunk out of sight, like the true people who created the Revolution." </p><p>That it was not merely interest in French politics which sent Heine to Paris in 1831, but also a perception that German air was not friendly to sympathizers in July revolutions, is humourously intimated in the "Geständnisse." </p><p>"I had done much and suffered much, and when the sun of the July Revolution arose in France, I had become very weary, and needed some recreation. Also, my native air was every day more unhealthy for me, and it was time I should seriously think of a change of climate. I had visions: the clouds terrified me, and made all sorts of ugly faces at me. It often seemed to me as if the sun were a Prussian cockade; at night I dreamed of a hideous black eagle, which gnawed my liver; and I was very melancholy. Add to this, I had become acquainted with an old Berlin Justizrath, who had spent many years in the fortress of Spandau, and he related to me how unpleasant it is when one is obliged to wear irons in winter. For myself I thought it very unchristian that the irons were not warmed a trifle. If the irons were warmed a little for us they would not make so unpleasant an impression, and even chilly natures might then bear them very well; it would be only proper consideration, too, if the fetters were perfumed with essence of roses and laurels, as is the case in this country (France). I asked my Justizrath whether he often got oysters to eat at Spandau? He said, No; Spandau was too far from the sea. Moreover, he said meat was very scarce there, and there was no kind of volaille except flies, which fell into one's soup. . . . Now, as I really needed some recreation, and as Spandau is too far from the sea for oysters to be got there, and the Spandau fly-soup did not seem very appetizing to me, as, besides all this, the Prussian chains are very cold in winter, and could not be conducive to my health, I resolved to visit Paris."</p><p>Since this time Paris has been Heine's home, and his best prose works have been written either to inform the Germans on French affairs or to inform the French on German philosophy and literature. He became a correspondent of the Allgemeine Zeitung, and his correspondence, which extends, with an interruption of several years, from 1831 to 1844, forms the volume entitled "Französische Zustände" (French Affairs), and the second and third volume of his "Vermischte Schriften." It is a witty and often wise commentary on public men and public events: Louis Philippe, Casimir Périer, Thiers, Guizot, Rothschild, the Catholic party, the Socialist party, have their turn of satire and appreciation, for Heine deals out both with an impartiality which made his less favorable critics—Börne, for example—charge him with the rather incompatible sins of reckless caprice and venality. Literature and art alternate with politics: we have now a sketch of George Sand, or a description of one of Horace Vernet's pictures,—now a criticism of Victor Hugo or of Liszt,—now an irresistible caricature of Spontini or Kalkbrenner,—and occasionally the predominant satire is relieved by a fine saying or a genial word of admiration. And all is done with that airy lightness, yet precision of touch, which distinguishes Heine beyond any living writer. The charge of venality was loudly made against Heine in Germany: first, it was said that he was paid to write; then, that he was paid to abstain from writing; and the accusations were supposed to have an irrefragable basis in the fact that he accepted a stipend from the French government. He has never attempted to conceal the reception of that stipend, and we think his statement (in the "Vermischte Schriften") of the circumstances under which it was offered and received, is a sufficient vindication of himself and M. Guizot from any dishonor in the matter. </p><p>It may be readily imagined that Heine, with so large a share of the Gallic element as he has in his composition, was soon at his ease in Parisian society, and the years here were bright with intellectual activity and social enjoyment. "His wit," wrote August Lewald, "is a perpetual gushing fountain; he throws off the most delicious descriptions with amazing facility, and sketches the most comic characters in conversations." Such a man could not be neglected in Paris, and Heine was sought on all sides—as a guest in distinguished salons, as a possible proselyte in the circle of the Saint Simonians. His literary productiveness seems to have been furthered by this congenial life, which, however, was soon to some extent embittered by the sense of exile; for since 1835 both his works and his person have been the object of denunciation by the German governments. Between 1833 and 1845 appeared the four volumes of the "Salon," "Die Romantische Schule" (both written, in the first instance, in French), the book on Börne, "Atta Troll," a romantic poem, "Deutschland," an exquisitely humorous poem, describing his last visit to Germany, and containing some grand passages of serious writing; and the "Neue Gedichte," a collection of lyrical poems. Among the most interesting of his prose works are the second volume of the "Salon," which contains a survey of religion and philosophy in Germany, and the "Romantische Schule," a delightful introduction to that phase of German literature known as the Romantic school. The book on Börne, which appeared in 1840, two years after the death of that writer, excited great indignation in Germany, as a wreaking of vengeance on the dead, an insult to the memory of a man who had worked and suffered in the cause of freedom—a cause which was Heine's own. Börne, we may observe parenthetically for the information of those who are not familiar with recent German literature, was a remarkable political writer of the ultra-liberal party in Germany, who resided in Paris at the same time with Heine: a man of stern, uncompromising partisanship and bitter humour. Without justifying Heine's production of this book, we see excuses for him which should temper the condemnation passed on it. There was a radical opposition of nature between him and Börne; to use his own distinction, Heine is a Hellene—sensuous, realistic, exquisitely alive to the beautiful; while Börne was a Nazarene—ascetic, spiritualistic, despising the pure artist as destitute of earnestness. Heine has too keen a perception of practical absurdities and damaging exaggerations ever to become a thoroughgoing partisan; and with a love of freedom, a faith in the ultimate triumph of democratic principles, of which we see no just reason to doubt the genuineness and consistency, he has been unable to satisfy more zealous and one-sided liberals by giving his adhesion to their views and measures, or by adopting a denunciatory tone against those in the opposite ranks. Börne could not forgive what he regarded as Heine's epicurean indifference and artistic dalliance, and he at length gave vent to his antipathy in savage attacks on him through the press, accusing him of utterly lacking character and principle, and even of writing under the influence of venal motives. To these attacks Heine remained absolutely mute—from contempt according to his own account; but the retort, which he resolutely refrained from making during Börne's life, comes in this volume published after his death with the concentrated force of long-gathering thunder. The utterly inexcusable part of the book is the caricature of Börne's friend, Madame Wohl, and the scurrilous insinuations concerning Börne's domestic life. It is said, we know not with how much truth, that Heine had to answer for these in a duel with Madame Wohl's husband, and that, after receiving a serious wound, he promised to withdraw the offensive matter from a future edition. That edition, however, has not been called for. Whatever else we may think of the book, it is impossible to deny its transcendent talent—the dramatic vigor with which Börne is made present to us, the critical acumen with which he is characterized, and the wonderful play of wit, pathos, and thought which runs through the whole. But we will let Heine speak for himself, and first we will give part of his graphic description of the way in which Börne's mind and manners grated on his taste:—</p><p>"To the disgust which, in intercourse with Börne, I was in danger of feeling toward those who surrounded him, was added the annoyance I felt from his perpetual talk about politics. Nothing but political argument, and again political argument, even at table, where he managed to hunt me out. At dinner, when I so gladly forget all the vexations of the world, he spoiled the best dishes for me by his patriotic gall, which he poured as a bitter sauce over everything. Calf's feet, à la maître d'hôtel, then my innocent bonne bouche, he completely spoiled for me by Job's tidings from Germany, which he scraped together out of the most unreliable newspapers. And then his accursed remarks, which spoiled one's appetite! . . . This was a sort of table-talk which did not greatly exhilarate me, and I avenged myself by affecting an excessive, almost impassioned indifference for the object of Börne's enthusiasm. For example, Börne was indignant that immediately on my arrival in Paris I had nothing better to do than to write for German papers a long account of the Exhibition of Pictures. I omit all discussion as to whether that interest in Art which induced me to undertake this work was so utterly irreconcilable with the revolutionary interests of the day; but Börne saw in it a proof of my indifference toward the sacred cause of humanity, and I could in my turn spoil the taste of his patriotic sauerkraut for him by talking all dinner-time of nothing but pictures, of Robert's ‘Reapers,' Horace Vernet's ‘Judith,' and Scheffer's ‘Faust.' . . . That I never thought it worth while to discuss my political principles with him it is needless to say; and once when he declared that he had found a contradiction in my writings, I satisfied myself with the ironical answer, ‘You are mistaken, mon cher; such contradictions never occur in my works, for always before I begin to write, I read over the statement of my political principles in my previous writings, that I may not contradict myself, and that no one may be able to reproach me with apostasy from my liberal principles.'"</p><p>And here is his own account of the spirit in which the book was written:— </p><p>"I was never Börne's friend, nor was I ever his enemy. The displeasure which he could often excite in me was never very important, and he atoned for it sufficiently by the cold silence which I opposed to all his accusations and raillery. While he lived I wrote not a line against him, I never thought about him, I ignored him completely; and that enraged him beyond measure. If I now speak of him, I do so neither out of enthusiasm nor out of uneasiness; I am conscious of the coolest impartiality. I write here neither an apology nor a critique, and as in painting the man I go on my own observation, the image I present of him ought perhaps to be regarded as a real portrait. And such a monument is due to him—to the great wrestler who, in the arena of our political games, wrestled so courageously, and earned, if not the laurel, certainly the crown of oak leaves. I give an image with his true features, without idealization—the more like him the more honorable for his memory. He was neither a genius nor a hero; he was no Olympian god. He was a man, a denizen of this earth; he was a good writer and a great patriot. . . . Beautiful, delicious peace, which I feel at this moment in the depths of my soul! Thou rewardest me sufficiently for everything I have done and for everything I have despised. . . . I shall defend myself neither from the reproach of indifference nor from the suspicion of venality. I have for years, during the life of the insinuator, held such self-justification unworthy of me; now even decency demands silence. That would be a frightful spectacle!—polemics between Death and Exile! Dost thou stretch out to me a beseeching hand from the grave? Without rancor I reach mine toward thee. . . . See how noble it is and pure! It was never soiled by pressing the hands of the mob, any more than by the impure gold of the people's enemy. In reality thou hast never injured me. . . . In all thy insinuations there is not a louis d'or's worth of truth." </p><p>In one of these years Heine was married, and, in deference to the sentiments of his wife, married according to the rites of the Catholic Church. On this fact busy rumour afterward founded the story of his conversion to Catholicism, and could of course name the day and spot on which he abjured Protestanism. In his "Geständnisse" Heine publishes a denial of this rumor; less, he says, for the sake of depriving the Catholics of the solace they may derive from their belief in a new convert, than in order to cut off from another party the more spiteful satisfaction of bewailing his instability: </p><p>"That statement of time and place was entirely correct. I was actually on the specified day in the specified church, which was, moreover, a Jesuit church, namely, St. Sulpice; and I then went through a religious act. But this act was no odious abjuration, but a very innocent conjugation; that is to say, my marriage, already performed, according to the civil law there received the ecclesiastical consecration, because my wife, whose family are staunch Catholics, would not have thought her marriage sacred enough without such a ceremony. And I would on no account cause this beloved being any uneasiness or disturbance in her religious views." </p><p>For sixteen years—from 1831 to 1847—Heine lived that rapid concentrated life which is known only in Paris; but then, alas! stole on the "days of darkness" and they were to be many. In 1847 he felt the approach of the terrible spinal disease which has for seven years chained him to his bed in acute suffering. The last time he went out of doors, he tells us, was in May, 1848:— </p><p>"With difficulty I dragged myself to the Louvre, and I almost sank down as I entered the magnificent hall where the ever-blessed goddess of beauty, our beloved Lady of Milo, stands on her pedestal. At her feet I lay long, and wept so bitterly that a stone must have pitied me. The goddess looked compassionately on me, but at the same time disconsolately, as if she would say, Dost thou not see, then, that I have no arms, and thus cannot help thee?"</p><p>Since 1848, then, this poet, whom the lovely objects of Nature have always "haunted like a passion," has not descended from the second story of a Parisian house; this man of hungry intellect has been shut out from all direct observation of life, all contact with society, except such as is derived from visitors to his sick-room. The terrible nervous disease has affected his eyes; the sight of one is utterly gone, and he can only raise the lid of the other by lifting it with his finger. Opium alone is the beneficent genius that stills his pain. We hardly know whether to call it an alleviation or an intensification of the torture that Heine retains his mental vigor, his poetic imagination, and his incisive wit; for if this intellectual activity fills up a blank, it widens the sphere of suffering. His brother described him in 1851 as still, in moments when the hand of pain was not too heavy on him, the same Heinrich Heine, poet and satirist by turns. In such moments he would narrate the strangest things in the gravest manner. But when he came to an end, he would roguishly lift up the lid of his right eye with his finger to see the impression he had produced; and if his audience had been listening with a serious face, he would break into Homeric laughter. We have other proof than personal testimony that Heine's disease allows his genius to retain much of its energy, in the "Romanzero," a volume of poems published in 1851, and written chiefly during the three first years of his illness; and in the first volume of the "Vermischte Schriften," also the product of recent years. Very plaintive is the poet's own description of his condition, in the epilogue to the "Romanzero:"— </p><p>"Do I really exist? My body is so shrunken that I am hardly anything but a voice; and my bed reminds me of the singing grave of the magician Merlin, which lies in the forest of Brozeliand, in Brittany, under tall oaks whose tops soar like green flames toward heaven. Alas! I envy thee those trees and the fresh breeze that moves their branches, brother Merlin, for no green leaf rustles about my mattress-grave in Paris, where early and late I hear nothing but the rolling of vehicles, hammering, quarrelling, and piano-strumming. A grave without repose, death without the privileges of the dead, who have no debts to pay, and need write neither letters nor books—that is a piteous condition. Long ago the measure has been taken for my coffin and for my necrology, but I die so slowly that the process is tedious for me as well as my friends. But patience: everything has an end. You will one day find the booth closed where the puppet-show of my humour has so often delighted you." </p><p>As early as 1850, it was rumored that since Heine's illness a change had taken place in his religious views; and as rumor seldom stops short of extremes, it was soon said that he had become a thorough pietist, Catholics and Protestants by turns claiming him as a convert. Such a change in so uncompromising an iconoclast, in a man who had been so zealous in his negations as Heine, naturally excited considerable sensation in the camp he was supposed to have quitted, as well as in that he was supposed to have joined. In the second volume of the "Salon," and in the "Romantische Schule," written in 1834 and '35, the doctrine of Pantheism is dwelt on with a fervour and unmixed seriousness which show that Pantheism was then an animating faith to Heine, and he attacks what he considers the false spiritualism and asceticism of Christianity as the enemy of true beauty in Art, and of social well-being. Now, however, it was said that Heine had recanted all his heresies; but from the fact that visitors to his sick-room brought away very various impressions as to his actual religious views, it seemed probable that his love of mystification had found a tempting opportunity for exercise on this subject, and that, as one of his friends said, he was not inclined to pour out unmixed wine to those who asked for a sample out of mere curiosity. At length, in the epilogue to the "Romanzero," dated 1851, there appeared, amid much mystifying banter, a declaration that he had embraced Theism and the belief in a future life, and what chiefly lent an air of seriousness and reliability to this affirmation was the fact that he took care to accompany it with certain negations:—</p><p>"As concerns myself, I can boast of no particular progress in politics; I adhered (after 1848) to the same democratic principles which had the homage of my youth, and for which I have ever since glowed with increasing fervor. In theology, on the contrary, I must accuse myself of retrogression, since, as I have already confessed, I returned to the old superstition—to a personal God. This fact is, once for all, not to be stifled, as many enlightened and well-meaning friends would fain have had it. But I must expressly contradict the report that my retrograde movement has carried me as far as to the threshold of a Church, and that I have even been received into her lap. No: my religious convictions and views have remained free from any tincture of ecclesiasticism; no chiming of bells has allured me, no altar candles have dazzled me. I have dallied with no dogmas, and have not utterly renounced my reason." </p><p>This sounds like a serious statement. But what shall we say to a convert who plays with his newly-acquired belief in a future life, as Heine does in the very next page? He says to his reader:— </p><p>"Console thyself; we shall meet again in a better world, where I also mean to write thee better books. I take for granted that my health will there be improved, and that Swedenborg has not deceived me. He relates, namely, with great confidence, that we shall peacefully carry on our old occupations in the other world, just as we have done in this; that we shall there preserve our individuality unaltered, and that death will produce no particular change in our organic development. Swedenborg is a thoroughly honorable fellow, and quite worthy of credit in what he tells us about the other world, where he saw with his own eyes the persons who had played a great part on our earth. Most of them, he says, remained unchanged, and busied themselves with the same things as formerly; they remained stationary, were old-fashioned, rococo—which now and then produced a ludicrous effect. For example, our dear Dr. Martin Luther kept fast by his doctrine of Grace, about which he had for three hundred years daily written down the same mouldy arguments—just in the same way as the late Baron Ekstein, who during twenty years printed in the Allgemeine Zeitung one and the same article, perpetually chewing over again the old cud of Jesuitical doctrine. But, as we have said, all persons who once figured here below were not found by Swedenborg in such a state of fossil immutability: many had considerably developed their character, both for good and evil, in the other world; and this gave rise to some singular results. Some who had been heroes and saints on earth had there sunk into scamps and good-for-nothings; and there were examples, too, of a contrary transformation. For instance, the fumes of self-conceit mounted to Saint Anthony's head when he learned what immense veneration and adoration had been paid to him by all Christendom; and he who here below withstood the most terrible temptations was now quite an impertinent rascal and dissolute gallows-bird, who vied with his pig in rolling himself in the mud. The chaste Susanna, from having been excessively vain of her virtue, which she thought indomitable, came to a shameful fall, and she who once so gloriously resisted the two old men, was a victim to the seductions of the young Absalom, the son of David. On the contrary, Lot's daughters had in the lapse of time become very virtuous, and passed in the other world for models of propriety: the old man, alas! had stuck to the wine-flask." </p><p>In his "Geständnisse," the retractation of former opinions and profession of Theism are renewed, but in a strain of irony that repels our sympathy and baffles our psychology. Yet what strange, deep pathos is mingled with the audacity of the following passage!— </p><p>"What avails it me, that enthusiastic youths and maidens crown my marble bust with laurel, when the withered hands of an aged nurse are pressing Spanish flies behind my ears? What avails it me, that all the roses of Shiraz glow and waft incense for me? Alas! Shiraz is two thousand miles from the Rue d'Amsterdam, where, in the wearisome loneliness of my sick-room, I get no scent, except it be, perhaps, the perfume of warmed towels. Alas! God's satire weighs heavily on me. The great Author of the universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, was bent on demonstrating, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly, German Aristophanes, how my wittiest sarcasms are only pitiful attempts at jesting in comparison with His, and how miserably I am beneath him in humour, in colossal mockery." </p><p>For our own part, we regard the paradoxical irreverence with which Heine professes his theoretical reverence as pathological, as the diseased exhibition of a predominant tendency urged into anomalous action by the pressure of pain and mental privation—as a delirium of wit starved of its proper nourishment. It is not for us to condemn, who have never had the same burden laid on us; it is not for pigmies at their ease to criticise the writhings of the Titan chained to the rock. </p><p>On one other point we must touch before quitting Heine's personal history. There is a standing accusation against him in some quarters of wanting political principle, of wishing to denationalize himself, and of indulging in insults against his native country. Whatever ground may exist for these accusations, that ground is not, so far as we see, to be found in his writings. He may not have much faith in German revolutions and revolutionists; experience, in his case as in that of others, may have thrown his millennial anticipations into more distant perspective; but we see no evidence that he has ever swerved from his attachment to the principles of freedom, or written anything which to a philosophic mind is incompatible with true patriotism. He has expressly denied the report that he wished to become naturalized in France; and his yearning toward his native land and the accents of his native language is expressed with a pathos the more reliable from the fact that he is sparing in such effusions. We do not see why Heine's satire of the blunders and foibles of his fellow-countrymen should be denounced as a crime of lèse-patrie, any more than the political caricatures of any other satirist. The real offences of Heine are his occasional coarseness and his unscrupulous personalities, which are reprehensible, not because they are directed against his fellow-countrymen, but because they are personalities. That these offences have their precedents in men whose memory the world delights to honour does not remove their turpitude, but it is a fact which should modify our condemnation in a particular case; unless, indeed, we are to deliver our judgments on a principle of compensation—making up for our indulgence in one direction by our severity in another. On this ground of coarseness and personality, a true bill may be found against Heine; not, we think, on the ground that he has laughed at what is laughable in his compatriots. Here is a specimen of the satire under which we suppose German patriots wince:— </p><p>"Rhenish Bavaria was to be the starting-point of the German revolution. Zweibrücken was the Bethlehem in which the infant Saviour—Freedom—lay in the cradle, and gave whimpering promise of redeeming the world. Near his cradle bellowed many an ox, who afterward, when his horns were reckoned on, showed himself a very harmless brute. It was confidently believed that the German revolution would begin in Zweibrücken, and everything was there ripe for an outbreak. But, as has been hinted, the tender-heartedness of some persons frustrated that illegal undertaking. For example, among the Bipontine conspirators there was a tremendous braggart, who was always loudest in his rage, who boiled over with the hatred of tyranny, and this man was fixed on to strike the first blow, by cutting down a sentinel who kept an important post. . . . . ‘What!' cried the man, when this order was given him—‘What!—me! Can you expect so horrible, so bloodthirsty an act of me? I—I, kill an innocent sentinel? I, who am the father of a family! And this sentinel is perhaps also father of a family. One father of a family kill another father of a family? Yes. Kill—murder!'"</p><p>In political matters, Heine, like all men whose intellect and taste predominate too far over their impulses to allow of their becoming partisans, is offensive alike to the aristocrat and the democrat. By the one he is denounced as a man who holds incendiary principles, by the other as a half-hearted "trimmer." He has no sympathy, as he says, with "that vague, barren pathos, that useless effervescence of enthusiasm, which plunges, with the spirit of a martyr, into an ocean of generalities, and which always reminds me of the American sailor, who had so fervent an enthusiasm for General Jackson, that he at last sprang from the top of a mast into the sea, crying, "I die for General Jackson!" </p><p>"But thou liest, Brutus, thou liest, Cassius, and thou, too, liest, Asinius, in maintaining that my ridicule attacks those ideas which are the precious acquisition of Humanity, and for which I myself have so striven and suffered. No! for the very reason that those ideas constantly hover before the poet in glorious splendor and majesty, he is the more irresistibly overcome by laughter when he sees how rudely, awkwardly, and clumsily those ideas are seized and mirrored in the contracted minds of contemporaries. . . . There are mirrors which have so rough a surface that even an Apollo reflected in them becomes a caricature, and excites our laughter. But we laugh then only at the caricature, not at the god." </p><p>For the rest, why should we demand of Heine that he should be a hero, a patriot, a solemn prophet, any more than we should demand of a gazelle that it should draw well in harness? Nature has not made him of her sterner stuff—not of iron and adamant, but of pollen of flowers, the juice of the grape, and Puck's mischievous brain, plenteously mixing also the dews of kindly affection and the gold-dust of noble thoughts. It is, after all, a tribute which his enemies pay him when they utter their bitterest dictum, namely, that he is "nur Dichter"—only a poet. Let us accept this point of view for the present, and, leaving all consideration of him as a man, look at him simply as a poet and literary artist. </p><p>Heine is essentially a lyric poet. The finest products of his genius are </p><p>"Short swallow flights of song that dip </p><p>Their wings in tears, and skim away;" </p><p>and they are so emphatically songs that, in reading them, we feel as if each must have a twin melody born in the same moment and by the same inspiration. Heine is too impressible and mercurial for any sustained production; even in his short lyrics his tears sometimes pass into laughter and his laughter into tears; and his longer poems, "Atta Troll" and "Deutschland," are full of Ariosto-like transitions. His song has a wide compass of notes; he can take us to the shores of the Northern Sea and thrill us by the sombre sublimity of his pictures and dreamy fancies; he can draw forth our tears by the voice he gives to our own sorrows, or to the sorrows of "Poor Peter;" he can throw a cold shudder over us by a mysterious legend, a ghost story, or a still more ghastly rendering of hard reality; he can charm us by a quiet idyl, shake us with laughter at his overflowing fun, or give us a piquant sensation of surprise by the ingenuity of his transitions from the lofty to the ludicrous. This last power is not, indeed, essentially poetical; but only a poet can use it with the same success as Heine, for only a poet can poise our emotion and expectation at such a height as to give effect to the sudden fall. Heine's greatest power as a poet lies in his simple pathos, in the ever-varied but always natural expression he has given to the tender emotions. We may perhaps indicate this phase of his genius by referring to Wordsworth's beautiful little poem, "She dwelt among the untrodden ways;" the conclusion—</p><p>"She dwelt alone, and few could know </p><p> When Lucy ceased to be;</p><p>But she is in her grave, and, oh! </p><p> The difference to me"—</p><p>is entirely in Heine's manner; and so is Tennyson's poem of a dozen lines, called "Circumstance." Both these poems have Heine's pregnant simplicity. But, lest this comparison should mislead, we must say that there is no general resemblance between either Wordsworth, or Tennyson, and Heine. Their greatest qualities lie quite a way from the light, delicate lucidity, the easy, rippling music, of Heine's style. The distinctive charm of his lyrics may best be seen by comparing them with Goethe's. Both have the same masterly, finished simplicity and rhythmic grace; but there is more thought mingled with Goethe's feeling—his lyrical genius is a vessel that draws more water than Heine's, and, though it seems to glide along with equal ease, we have a sense of greater weight and force, accompanying the grace of its movements. </p><p>But for this very reason Heine touches our hearts more strongly; his songs are all music and feeling—they are like birds that not only enchant us with their delicious notes, but nestle against us with their soft breasts, and make us feel the agitated beating of their hearts. He indicates a whole sad history in a single quatrain: there is not an image in it, not a thought; but it is beautiful, simple, and perfect as a "big round tear"—it is pure feeling, breathed in pure music:— </p><p>"Anfangs wollt' ich fast verzagen </p><p>Und ich glaubt' ich trug es nie, </p><p>Und ich hab' es doch getragen— </p><p>Aber fragt mich nur nicht, wie."* </p><p>* At first I was almost in despair, and I thought I could never bear it, and yet I have borne it—only do not ask me how? </p><p>He excels equally in the more imaginative expression of feeling: he represents it by a brief image, like a finely cut cameo; he expands it into a mysterious dream, or dramatizes it in a little story, half ballad, half idyl; and in all these forms his art is so perfect that we never have a sense of artificiality or of unsuccessful effort; but all seems to have developed itself by the same beautiful necessity that brings forth vine-leaves and grapes and the natural curls of childhood. Of Heine's humourous poetry, "Deutschland" is the most charming specimen—charming, especially, because its wit and humour grow out of a rich loam of thought. "Atta Troll" is more original, more various, more fantastic; but it is too great a strain on the imagination to be a general favorite. We have said that feeling is the element in which Heine's poetic genius habitually floats; but he can occasionally soar to a higher region, and impart deep significance to picturesque symbolism; he can flash a sublime thought over the past and into the future; he can pour forth a lofty strain of hope or indignation. Few could forget, after once hearing them, the stanzas at the close of "Deutschland," in which he warns the King of Prussia not to incur the irredeemable hell which the injured poet can create for him—the singing flames of a Dante's terza rima! </p><p>"Kennst du die Hölle des Dante nicht, </p><p>Die schrecklichen Terzetten? </p><p>Wen da der Dichter hineingesperrt </p><p>Den kann kein Gott mehr retten. </p><p>"Kein Gott, kein Heiland, erlöst ihn je </p><p>Aus diesen singenden Flammen!</p><p>Nimm dich in Acht, das wir dich nicht </p><p>Zu solcher Hölle verdammen."† </p><p>*It is not fair to the English reader to indulge in German quotations, but in our opinion poetical translations are usually worse than valueless. For those who think differently, however, we may mention that Mr. Stores Smith has published a modest little book, containing "Selections from the Poetry of Heinrich Heine," and that a meritorious (American) translation of Heine's complete works, by Charles Leland is now appearing in shilling numbers. </p><p>As a prosaist, Heine is, in one point of view, even more distinguished than as a poet. The German language easily lends itself to all the purposes of poetry; like the ladies of the Middle Ages, it is gracious and compliant to the Troubadours. But as these same ladies were often crusty and repulsive to their unmusical mates, so the German language generally appears awkward and unmanageable in the hands of prose writers. Indeed, the number of really fine German prosaists before Heine would hardly have exceeded the numerating powers of a New Hollander, who can count three and no more. Persons the most familiar with German prose testify that there is an extra fatigue in reading it, just as we feel an extra fatigue from our walk when it takes us over ploughed clay. But in Heine's hands German prose, usually so heavy, so clumsy, so dull, becomes, like clay in the hands of the chemist, compact, metallic, brilliant; it is German in an allotropic condition. No dreary labyrinthine sentences in which you find "no end in wandering mazes lost;" no chains of adjectives in linked harshness long drawn out; no digressions thrown in as parentheses; but crystalline definiteness and clearness, fine and varied rhythm, and all that delicate precision, all those felicities of word and cadence, which belong to the highest order of prose. And Heine has proved—what Madame de Stäel seems to have doubted—that it is possible to be witty in German; indeed, in reading him, you might imagine that German was pre-eminently the language of wit, so flexible, so subtle, so piquant does it become under his management. He is far more an artist in prose than Goethe. He has not the breadth and repose, and the calm development which belong to Goethe's style, for they are foreign to his mental character; but he excels Goethe in susceptibility to the manifold qualities of prose, and in mastery over its effects. Heine is full of variety, of light and shadow: he alternates between epigrammatic pith, imaginative grace, sly allusion, and daring piquancy; and athwart all these there runs a vein of sadness, tenderness, and grandeur which reveals the poet. He continually throws out those finely chiselled sayings which stamp themselves on the memory, and become familiar by quotation. For example: "The People have time enough, they are immortal; kings only are mortal."—"Wherever a great soul utters its thoughts, there is Golgotha."—"Nature wanted to see how she looked, and she created Goethe."—"Only the man who has known bodily suffering is truly a man; his limbs have their Passion history, they are spiritualized." He calls Rubens "this Flemish Titan, the wings of whose genius were so strong that he soared as high as the sun, in spite of the hundred-weight of Dutch cheeses that hung on his legs." Speaking of Börne's dislike to the calm creations of the true artist, he says, "He was like a child which, insensible to the glowing significance of a Greek statue, only touches the marble and complains of cold." </p><p>The most poetic and specifically humourous of Heine's prose writings are the "Reisebilder." The comparison with Sterne is inevitable here; but Heine does not suffer from it, for if he falls below Sterne in raciness of humour, he is far above him in poetic sensibility and in reach and variety of thought. Heine's humour is never persistent, it never flows on long in easy gaiety and drollery; where it is not swelled by the tide of poetic feeling, it is continually dashing down the precipice of a witticism. It is not broad and unctuous; it is aerial and sprite-like, a momentary resting-place between his poetry and his wit. In the "Reisebilder" he runs through the whole gamut of his powers, and gives us every hue of thought, from the wildly droll and fantastic to the sombre and the terrible. Here is a passage almost Dantesque in conception:—</p><p>"Alas! one ought in truth to write against no one in this world. Each of us is sick enough in this great lazaretto, and many a polemical writing reminds me involuntarily of a revolting quarrel, in a little hospital at Cracow, of which I chanced to be a witness, and where it was horrible to hear how the patients mockingly reproached each other with their infirmities: how one who was wasted by consumption jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy; how one laughed at another's cancer in the nose, and this one again at his neighbor's locked-jaw or squint, until at last the delirious fever-patient sprang out of bed and tore away the coverings from the wounded bodies of his companions, and nothing was to be seen but hideous misery and mutilation." </p><p>And how fine is the transition in the very next chapter, where, after quoting the Homeric description of the feasting gods, he says:— </p><p>"Then suddenly approached, panting, a pale Jew, with drops of blood on his brow, with a crown of thorns on his head, and a great cross laid on his shoulders; and he threw the cross on the high table of the gods, so that the golden cups tottered, and the gods became dumb and pale, and grew ever paler, till they at last melted away into vapor." </p><p>The richest specimens of Heine's wit are perhaps to be found in the works which have appeared since the "Reisebilder." The years, if they have intensified his satirical bitterness, have also given his wit a finer edge and polish. His sarcasms are so subtly prepared and so slily allusive, that they may often escape readers whose sense of wit is not very acute; but for those who delight in the subtle and delicate flavors of style, there can hardly be any wit more irresistible than Heine's. We may measure its force by the degree in which it has subdued the German language to its purposes, and made that language brilliant in spite of a long hereditary transmission of dulness. As one of the most harmless examples of his satire, take this on a man who has certainly had his share of adulation:— </p><p>"Assuredly it is far from my purpose to depreciate M. Victor Cousin. The titles of this celebrated philosopher even lay me under an obligation to praise him. He belongs to that living pantheon of France which we call the peerage, and his intelligent legs rest on the velvet benches of the Luxembourg. I must indeed sternly repress all private feelings which might seduce me into an excessive enthusiasm. Otherwise I might be suspected of servility; for M. Cousin is very influential in the State by means of his position and his tongue. This consideration might even move me to speak of his faults as frankly as of his virtues. Will he himself disapprove of this? Assuredly not. I know that we cannot do higher honor to great minds than when we throw as strong a light on their demerits as on their merits. When we sing the praises of a Hercules, we must also mention that he once laid aside the lion's skin and sat down to the distaff: what then? he remains notwithstanding a Hercules! So when we relate similar circumstances concerning M. Cousin, we must nevertheless add, with discriminating eulogy: M. Cousin, if he has sometimes sat twaddling at the distaff, has never laid aside the lion's skin. . . . It is true that, having been suspected of demagogy, he spent some time in a German prison, just as Lafayette and Richard Cœur de Lion. But that M. Cousin there in his leisure hours studied Kant's ‘Critique of Pure Reason' is to be doubted on three grounds. First, this book is written in German. Secondly, in order to read this book, a man must understand German. Thirdly, M. Cousin does not understand German. . . . I fear I am passing unawares from the sweet waters of praise into the bitter ocean of blame. Yes, on one account I cannot refrain from bitterly blaming M. Cousin—namely, that he who loves truth far more than he loves Plato and Tenneman is unjust to himself when he wants to persuade us that he has borrowed something from the philosophy of Schelling and Hegel. Against this self-accusation I must take M. Cousin under my protection. On my word and conscience! this honorable man has not stolen a jot from Schelling and Hegel, and if he brought home anything of theirs, it was merely their friendship. That does honor to his heart. But there are many instances of such false self-accusation in psychology. I knew a man who declared that he had stolen silver spoons at the king's table; and yet we all knew that the poor devil had never been presented at court, and accused himself of stealing these spoons to make us believe that he had been a guest at the palace. No! In German philosophy M. Cousin has always kept the sixth commandment; here he has never pocketed a single idea, not so much as a salt-spoon of an idea. All witnesses agree in attesting that in this respect M. Cousin is honor itself. . . . I prophesy to you that the renown of M. Cousin, like the French Revolution, will go round the world! I hear some one wickedly add: Undeniably the renown of M. Cousin is going round the world, and it has already taken its departure from France."</p><p>The following "symbolical myth," about Louis Philippe is very characteristic of Heine's manner:— </p><p>"I remember very well that immediately on my arrival (in Paris) I hastened to the Palais Royal to see Louis Philippe. The friend who conducted me told me that the king now appeared on the terrace only at stated hours, but that formerly he was to be seen at any time for five francs. ‘For five francs!' I cried with amazement; ‘does he then show himself for money?' ‘No, but he is shown for money, and it happens in this way: There is a society of claqueurs, marchands de contremarques, and such riff-raff, who offered every foreigner to show him the king for five francs: if he would give ten francs, he might see the king raise his eyes to heaven, and lay his hand protestingly on his heart; if he would give twenty francs, the king would sing the Marseillaise. If the foreigner gave five francs, they raised a loud cheering under the king's windows, and His Majesty appeared on the terrace, bowed, and retired. If ten francs, they shouted still louder, and gesticulated as if they had been possessed, when the king appeared, who then, as a sign of silent emotion, raised his eyes to heaven and laid his hand on his heart. English visitors, however, would sometimes spend as much as twenty francs, and then the enthusiasm mounted to the highest pitch; no sooner did the king appear on the terrace than the Marseillaise was struck up and roared out frightfully, until Louis Philippe, perhaps only for the sake of putting an end to the singing, bowed, laid his hand on his heart, and joined in the Marseillaise. Whether, as is asserted, he beat time with his foot, I cannot say.'" </p><p>One more quotation, and it must be our last:— </p><p>"Oh the women! We must forgive them much, for they love much—and many. Their hate is properly only love turned inside out. Sometimes they attribute some delinquency to us, because they think they can in this way gratify another man. When they write, they have always one eye on the paper and the other on a man; and this is true of all authoresses, except the Countess Hahn-Hahn, who has only one eye." </p><p>RACHEL GRAY. </p><p>Rachel Gray. A Tale Founded on Fact. By Julia Kavanagh. </p><p>	London: Hurst and Blackett.</p><p>RACHEL GRAY  is not a story of a fine lady’s sorrows wept into embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, or of genius thrust into the background by toadesting stupidity. It does not harrow us with the sufferings and temptations of a destitute needlewoman, or abash us by the refined sentiments and heroic deeds of navvies and ratcatchers. It tells the trials of a dressmaker who could get work, and of a small grocer, very vulgar, and not at all heroic, whose business was gradually swallowed up by the large shop over the way. Thus far "Rachel Gray" is commendable: it occupies ground which is very far from being exhausted, and it undertakes to impress us with the every-day sorrows of our common place fellow-men, and so to widen our sympathies, as Browning beautifully says--</p><p>		Art was given for that:</p><p>	God uses us to help each other so,</p><p>	Lending our minds out.</p><p>"Rachel Gray" further professes to show how Christianity exhibits itself as a refining and consoling influence in that most prosaic stratum of society, the small shopkeeping class; and here is really a new sphere for a great artist who can paint from close observation, and who is neither a caricaturist nor a rose-colour sentimentatlist. </p><p>We wish we could say that Miss Kavanagh's judgment in choosing her subject has been equalled by her success in working it up. We do not feel that the story of "Rachel Gray" brings any nearer to us the real life of the class it attempts to depict; still less that "Rachel Gray's" piety gives the reader any true idea of piety as it exists in any possible dressmaker. It is an abstract piety, made up of humility, resignation, and devotion, feeding on Milton's sonnets, and quite disembodied of sectarian idiom and all other fleshly weaknesses which are beneath Miss Kavanagh’s own mind. Our own experience of what piety is amongst the uneducated has not brought us in contact with a Christianity wich smacks neither of the Church nor of the meeting-house, with an Evangelicalism which has no brogue; and if, when Miss Kavanagh says that her tale is founded on fact, she means that the character of “Rachel Gray” is a portrait, we are obliged. We are far from meaning that there are not feelings as essentially beautiful as Rachel Gray’s to be met with amongst the uneducated, but the feelings run into a specific mold; they do not exhibit themselves as abstract virtues, but as qualities belonging to an individual character, of mixed moral nature and uncultured intellect. All this, perhaps, Miss Kavanagh knows as well as we do; but either from too great haste to publish, or from unwillingness to give the requisite labor to her work, she has produced a book which might have been written in an ignorance both of heart and of life which we cannot impute to her. She even seems to be conscious herself of her failure towards the close of her volume, for she resorts to the very unartistic plan of telling her reader that he would be touched by the sorrows she describes, if they were depicted by an abler hand. </p><p>Oh, passion! eloquent pages have been wasted on thy woes; volumes have been written to tell mankind of thy delights and thy torments. To no other tale will youth bend its greedy ear, of no other feelings will man acknowledge the power to charm his spirit and his heart. And here was one who knew thee not in name or in truth, and yet who drank to the dregs, and to the last bitterness his cup of sorrow. Oh! miserable and unpoetic griefs of the prosaic poor. Where are ye, elements of power and pathos of our modern epic--the novel? A wretched shop that will not take, a sickly child that dies! Ay, and were the picture but drawn by an abler hand, know, proud reader, if proud thou art, that thy very heart could bleed, that thy very soul would be wrung to read this page from a poor man’s story. </p><p>To scold a reader for not feeling is a way of trying to make him feel which is more feminine than felicitous. A more favorable specimen of Miss Kavanagh’s style is the scene in which Rachel Gray is introduced to the reader. </p><p>A little six-roomed house it was, exactly facing the dreary, haunted mansion and exposed to all the noises aforesaid. It was, also, to say the truth, an abode of poor and mean aspect. In the window hung a dressmaker’s board, on which was modestly inscribed, with a list of prices, the name of-- </p><p>	“Rachel Gray.”</p><p>It was accompanied with patterns of yellow paper sleeves, trimmed in every color, an old book of fashions, and beautiful and bright, as if reared in wood or meadow, a pot of yellow crocuses in bloom. They were closing now, for evening was drawing in, and they knew the hour. </p><p>They had opened to light in the dingy parlor within, and which we will now enter. It was but a little room, and the soft gloom of a spring twilight half-filled it. The furniture, though poor and old-fashioned, was scrupulously clean; and it shone again in the flickering fire-light. A few discolored prints in black frames hung against the walls; two or three broken china ornaments adorned the wooden mantel-shelf, which was, moreover, decorated with a dark-looking mirror in a rim of tarnished gold. </p><p>By the fire, an elderly woman of grave and stern aspect, but who had once been handsome, sat reading the newspaper. Near the window, two apprentices sewed under the superintendence of Rachel Gray. </p><p>A mild ray [?]nt fell on her pale face and bending figure. She sewed on, serious and still, and the calm gravity of her aspect harmonised with the silence of the little parlour which nothing disturbed, save the ticking of an old clock behind the door, the occasional rustling of Mrs. Gray's newspaper, and the continuous and monotonous sound of stitching. </p><p>Rachel Gray looked upwards of thirty, yet she was younger by some years. She was a tall, thin, and awkward woman, sallow and faded before her time. She was not, and had never been handsome, yet there was a patient seriousness in the lines of her face, which, when it caught the eye, arrested it at once, and kept it long. Her brown, too, was broad and intellectual; her eyes were very fine, though their look was dreamy and abstracted; and her smile, when she did smile, which was not often, for she was slightly deaf and spoke little, was pleasant and very sweet. </p><p>She sewed on, as we have said, abstracted and serious, when gradually, for even in observation she was slow, the yellow crocuses attracted her attention. She looked at them meditatively, and watched them closing, with the decline of day. And, at length, as if she had not understood until then what was going on before her, she smiled, and admiringly exclaimed:-- </p><p>"Now do look at the creatures, mother!" </p><p>Mrs. Gray glanced up from her newspaper, and snuffed rather disdainfully. </p><p>"Lawk, Rachel!" she said, "you don't mean to call crocuses creatures--do you? I'll tell you what through," she added with a doleful shake of the head, "I don't know what her Majesty thinks; but I say the country can't stand it much longer." </p><p>Mrs. Gray had been cook in a Prime Minister's household, and this had naturally given her a political turn. </p><p>"The Lord has taught you," murmured Rachel, bending over the flowers with aomething like awe, and a glow spread over her sallow cheek, and there came a light to her large brown eyes. </p><p>The mere novel reader, who cares only for excitement or amusement, will find little attraction in "Rachel Gray." The story, as we have intimated, is of that quiet kind, which depends for its pathos and its humour on the delivate and masterly treatment of slight details, and in this sort of treatment it is altogether deficient. In our judgment, then, "Rachel Gray" is a failure; and it is our disagreeable duty to say so, for the sake not only of the public but of the authoress, from whose talents and diligence we hope for better things to come. </p><p>THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT. </p><p>The Shaving of Shagpat; an Arabian Entertainment. By George Meredith. </p><p>Chapman and Hall. </p><p>No art of religious symbolism has a deeper root in nature than that of turning with reverence towards the East. For almost all our good things--our most precious vegetables, our noblest animals, our loveliest flowers, our arts, our religious and philosophical ideas, our very nursery tales and romances have travelled to us from the East. In an historical as well as in a physical sense, the East is the Land of the Morning. Perhaps the simple reason of this may be, that when the earth first began to move on her axis her Asiastic side was towards the sun--her Eastern cheek first blushed under his rays. And so this priority of sunshine, like the first move in chess, gave the East the precedence though not the pre-eminence in all things; just as the garden slope that fronts the morning sun yields the earliest seedlings, though those seedlings may attain a hardier and more luxurient growth by being transplanted. But we leave this question to wiser heads-- </p><p>	"Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas."</p><p>(Excuse the novelty of teh quotation.) We have not carried our reader's thoughts to the East that we may discuss the reason why we owe it so many good things, but that we may introduce him to a new pleasure, due, at least indirectly, to that elder region of the earth. We mean "The Shaving of Shagpat" which is indeed an original fiction just produced in this western island, but which is so intensely Oriental in its conception and execution, that the author has done wisely to guard against the supposition of its being a translation, by prefixing the statement that it is derived from no Eastern source, but is altogether his own. </p><p>"The Shaving of Shagpat," is a work of genius, and of poetical genius. It has some of the tameness which belongs to mere imitations manufactured with servile effort or thrown off with simious facility. It is no patchwork of borrowed incidents. Mr. Meredith has not simply imitated Arabian fictions, he has been inspired by them; he has used Oriental forms, but only as an Oriental genius would have used them who had been "to the manner born." Goethe, when he wrote an immortal work under the inspiration of Oriental studies, very properly called it West- stliche--West-eastern--because it was thoroughly Western in spirit, though Eastern in its forms. But this double epithet would not give a true idea of Mr. Meredith's work, for we do not remember that throughout our reading we were once struck by an incongruity between the thought and the form, once startled by the intrusions of the chill north into the land of the desert and the palm. Perhaps more lynx-eyed critics, and more learned Orientalists, than we, may detect discrepancies to which we are blind, but our experience will at least indicate what is likely to be the average impression. In one particular, indeed, Mr. Meredith differs widely from his models, but that difference is a high merit: it lies in the exquisite delicacy of his love incidents and love scenes. In every other characteristic--in exuberance of imagery, in picturesque wildness of incident, in significant humour, in aphoristic wisdom, the "Shaving of Shagpat" is a new Arabian Night. To two-thirds of the reading world this is sufficient recommendation. </p><p>According to Oriental custom the main story of the book--The Shaving of Shagpat--forms the setting to several minor tales, which are told, on pretexts more or less plausible, by the various dramatis persone. We will not forestall the reader's pleasure by telling him who Shagpat was, or what were the wondrous adventures through which Shibli Bagarag, the wandering barber, became Master of the Event and the destroyer of illusions, by shaving from Shagpat the mysterious identical which had held men in subjection to him. There is plenty of deep meaning in the tale for those who cannot be satisfied without deep meanings, but there is no didactic thrusting forward of moral lessons, and our imagination in never chilled by a sense of allegorical intention predominating over poetic creation. Nothing can be more vivid and concrete than the narrative and description, nothing fresher and more vigorous than the imagery. Are we reading how horsemen pursued their journey? We are told that they "flourished their lances with cries, and jerked their heels into the flanks of their steeds, and stretched forward till their beards were mixed with the tossing manes, and the dust rose after them crimson in the sun." Is it a maiden's eyes we are to see? They are "dark, under a low arch of darker lashes, like stars on the skirts of storm." Sometimes the images are exquisitely poetical, as when Bhanavar looks forth "on the stars that were above the purple heights and the blushes of inner heaven that streamed up the sky;" sometimes ingenious and pithy: for example, "she clenched her hands an instant with that feeling which knocketh a nail in the coffin of a desire not dead." Indeed, one of the rarest chrams of the book is the contant alternation of passion and wild imaginativeness with humour and pithy, practical sense. Mr. Meredith is very happy in his imitation of the lyrical fragments which the Eastern tale-tellers weave into their narrative, either for the sake of giving emphasis to their sententiousness, or for the sake of giving a more intense utterance to passion, a loftier tone to description. We will quote a specimen of the latter kind from the story of Bhanavar the Beautiful. This story is the brightest gem among the minor tales, and perhaps in the whole book. It is admirably constructed and thoroughly poetic in its outline and texture.</p><p>Bhanavar gazed on her beloved, and the bridal dew overflowed her underlids, and she loosed her hair to let it flow, part over her shoulders, part over his, and in sighs that were the measure of music she sang: </p><p>		"I thought not to love again!</p><p>		But now I love as I loved not before;</p><p>		I love not: I adore!</p><p>	O my beloved, kiss, kiss me! waste thy kisses like a rain.</p><p>		Are not thy red lips fain?</p><p>			Oh, and so softly they greet!</p><p>			Am I not sweet!</p><p>		Sweet must I be for thee, or sweet in vain:</p><p>		  Sweet to thee only, my dear love!</p><p>		The lamps and censers sink, but cannot cheat</p><p>		  Those eyes of thine that shoot above,</p><p>		  Trembling lustres of the dove!</p><p>		A darkness drowns all lustres: still I see</p><p>			Thee, my love, thee!</p><p>		The, my glory of gold from head to feet!</p><p>	Oh, how the lids of the world close quite when our lips meet!"</p><p>Ameryl strained her to him, and responded: </p><p>		"My life was midnight on the mountain side;</p><p>		  Cold stars were on the heights:</p><p>		There, in my darkness, I had lived and died,</p><p>		  Contents with little lights.</p><p>		Sudden I saw the heavens flush with a beam,</p><p>		  And I ascended soon,</p><p>		And evermore over mankind supreme</p><p>		  Stood silver in the moon."</p><p>And he fell playfully into a new metre, singing: </p><p>		  "Who will paint my beloved</p><p>			In musical word or colour?</p><p>		  Earth with an envy is moved:</p><p>			Sea-shells and roses she brings,</p><p>			Gems from the green ocean-springs,</p><p>			Fruits with the fairy bloom-dews,</p><p>			Feathers of Paradise hues,</p><p>			Waters with jewel-bright falls,</p><p>			Ore from the Genii-halls:</p><p>		  All in their splendour approved;</p><p>		  All; but, match'd with my beloved,</p><p>			Darker, denser, and duller."</p><p>Then she kissed him for that song, and sang: </p><p>		"Once to be beautiful was my pride,</p><p>		  And I blush'd in love with my own bright brow</p><p>		Once, when a wooer was by my side,</p><p>		  I worship'd the object that had his vow:</p><p>		Different, different, different now,</p><p>		  Different now is my beauty to me:</p><p>		Different, different, different now!</p><p>		  For I prize it alone becuase prized by thee."</p><p>Almeryl stretched his arm to the lattice, and drew it open, letting in the soft night wind, and the sound of the fountain and the bulbul and the beam of the stars, and versed to her in the languor of deep love: </p><p>			"Whether we die or we live</p><p>			  Matters it now no more;</p><p>			Life has nought further to give:</p><p>			  Love has nought further to give:</p><p>			Come to us either, we're rife,--</p><p>			  Death or life!</p><p>			"Death can take not away,</p><p>			  Darkness and light are the same:</p><p>			We are beyond the pale ray,</p><p>			  Wrapt in a rosier flame:</p><p>			Welcome which will to our breath,--</p><p>			  Life or death!'</p><p>An example of Mr. Meredith's skill in humorous apologue is the Punishment of Khipil the Builder, which is short enough to be quoted without much mutilation:-- </p><p>The relate that Shapesh, the Persian, commanded the building of a palace and Khipil was his builder. The work lingered from the first year of the reign of Shapesh even to his fourteenth. One day Shapesh went to the river-side where it stood, to inspect it. Khipil was sitting on a marble slab among the stones and blocks; round him stretched lazily the masons and stonecutters and slaves of burden; and they with the curve of humorous enjoyment on their lips, for he was reciting to them adventures, interspersed with anecdotes and recitations and poetic instances, as was his wont. They were like pleased flocks whom the shepherd hath led to a pasture freshened with brooks, there to feed indolently; he, the shepherd, in the midst. </p><p>Now the King said to him, "O Khipil, show me my palace where it standesth, for I desire to gratify my sight with its fairness." </p><p>Khipil abased himself before Shahpesh, and answered, "Tis even here, O King of the age, where thou delightest the earth with thy foot, and the ear of thy slave with sweetness. Surely a site of vantage, one that dominateth earth, sir, and water, which is the builder's first and chief requisition for a noble palace, a palace to fill foreign kings and sultans with the distraction of envy; and it is, O Sovereign of the time, a site, this site I have chosen, to occupy the tongues of travellers and awaken the flights of poets!" </p><p>Shahpesh smiled and said, "The site is good! I laud the site! Likewise I laud the wisdom of Ebn Busrac, where he exclaims:-- </p><p>	"'Be sure, where Virtue falleth to appear,</p><p>	For her a gorgeous mansion men will rear;</p><p>	And day and night her praises will be heard,</p><p>	Where never yet she spake a single word,'"</p><p>Then said he, "O Khipil, my builder, there was once a farm-servant that, have neglected in the seed-time to sow, took to singing the richness of his soil when it was harvest, in proof of which he displayed the abundance of weeds that coloured the land everywhere. Discover to me now the completeness of my halls and apartments, I pray thee, O Khipil, and be the excellence of they construction made visible to me?" </p><p>Quoth Khipil, "To hear is to obey." </p><p>He conducted Shahpesh among the unfinished saloons and imperfect courts and roofless rooms, and by half-erected obelisks, and columns pierced and chipped, of the palace of his building. And he was bewildered at the words spoken by Shahpesh; but now the king exalted him, and admired the perfection of his craft, the greatness of his labour, the speediness of his construction, his assiduity; feigning not to behold his negligence. </p><p>Presently they went up-winding balusters to a marble terrace, and the King said, "Such is thy devotion and constancy to toil, O Khipil, that thous shalt walk before me here." </p><p>He then commanded Khipil to precede him, and Khipil was heightened with the honour. When Khipil had paraded a short space he stopped quickly, and said to Shapesh, "Here is, as it chanceth, a gap, O King! and we can go no further this way." </p><p>Shahpesh said, "All is perfect, and it is my will thou delay not to advance." </p><p>Khipil cried, "The gap is wide, O mighty King, and manifest, and it is the one incomplete part of thy palace." </p><p>Then said Shahpesh, "O Khipil, I see no distinction between one part and another; excellent are all parts in beauty and proportion, and there can be no part incomplete in this palace that occupieth the builder fourteen years in its building: so advance, and do my bidding." </p><p>Khipil yet hesitated, for the gap was of many strides, and at the bottom of the gap was a deep water, and he one that knew not the motion of swimming. But Shahpesh ordered his guard to point their arrows in the direction of Khipil, and Khipil stepped forth hurriedly, and fell into the gap, and was swallowed by the water below. When he rose the third time succour reached him, and he was drawn to land trembling, his teeth chattering. And Shahpesh praised him, and said, "This is an apt contrivance for a bath, Khipil, O my builder! well conceived; one that taketh by surprise; and it shall be thy reward daily when much talking hath fatigued thee." </p><p>Then he bade Khipil lead him to the hall of state. And when they were there Shahpesh said, "For a privilege, and as a mark of my approbation, I give thee permission to sit in the marble chair of yonder throne, even in my presence, O Khipil." </p><p>Khipil said, "Surely, O King, the chair is not yet executed." </p><p>And Shapesh exclaimed, "If this be so, thou art but the length of they measure on the ground, O talkative one!" </p><p>Khipil said, "Surely, O King the chair is not yet executed." </p><p>And Shahpesh exclaimed, "If this be so, thou art but the length of thy measure on the ground, O talkative one!" </p><p>Khipil said, "Nay, 'tis not so, O King of splendours! blind that I am! yonder's indeed the chair." </p><p>And Khipil feared the King, and went to the place where the chair should be, and bent his body in a sitting posture, eyeing the King, and made pretence to sit in the chair of Shahpesh. </p><p>Then said Shahpesh, "As a token that I approve thy execution of the chair, thous shalt be honoured by remaining seated in it one day and one night; but move thou to the right or to the left, showing thy soul insensible of the honour done thee, transfixed shalt thou be with twenty arrows and five." </p><p>The King then left him with a guard of twenty-five of his body-guard; and they stood around him with bent bows, so that Khipil dared not move from his sitting posture. And the masons and the people crowded to see Khipil sitting on his master's chair, for it became rumoured about. When they beheld him sitting upon nothing, and he trembling to stir for fear of the loosening of the arrows, they laughed so that they rolled upon the floor of the hall, and the echoes of laughter were a thousandfold. Surely the arrows of the guard swayed with the laughter that shook them.</p><p>Now when the time had expired for his sitting in the chair, Shahpesh returned to him, and he was cramped, pitiable to see; and Shahpesh said, "Thou hast been exalted above men, O Khipil! for that thou didst executre for thy master has been found fitting for thee." </p><p>Then he bade Khipil lead the way to the noble gardens of dalliance and pleasure that he had planted and contrived. And Khipil went in that state described by the poet, when we go draggingly, with remonstrating members, </p><p>	"Knowing a dreadful strength behind</p><p>	And a dark fate before."</p><p>They came to the gardens, and behold, they were full of weeds and nettles, the fountains dry, no tree to be seen--a desert. And Shahpesh cried, "This is indeed of admirable design, O Khipil! Feelest thou not the cooleness of the fountains!--their refreshingness! Truly I am grateful to thee! And these flowers, pluck me now a handful, and tell me of their perfume." </p><p>Khipil plucked a handful of the nettles that were there in the place of flowers, and put his nose to them before Shahpesh till his nose was reddened; and desire to rub it waxed in him, and possessed him, and became a passion, so that he could scarce refrain from rubbing it even in the King's presence. And the Kind encouraged him to sniff and enjoy their fragrance, repeating the poet's words:-- </p><p>	"Methinks I am a lover and a child,</p><p>	A little child and happy lover, both!</p><p>	When by the breath of flowers I am beguiled</p><p>	From sense of pain, and lull'd in odorous sloth.</p><p>	So I adore them, that no mistress sweet</p><p>	Seems worthier of the love that they awake:</p><p>	In innocence and beauty more complete,</p><p>	Was never maiden cheek in morning lake.</p><p>	Oh, while I live, surround me with fresh flowers!</p><p>	Oh, when I die, then bury me in their bowers!"</p><p>And the King said, "What sayest thou, O my builder? that is a fair quotation, applicable to thy feelings, one that expresseth them?" </p><p>Khipil answered, "'Tis eloquent, O great King! comprehensiveness would be its portion, but that it alludeth not to the delight of chafing." </p><p>Then Shahpesh laughed, and cried, "Chafe not! it is an ill thing and a hideous! This nosegay, O Khipil, is for thee to present to thy mistress. Truly she will receive thee well after its presentation! I will have it now sent in thy name, with word that thou followest quickly. And for thy nettled nose, surely if the whim seize thee that thous desirest its chafing, to they neighbour is permitted what to thy hand is refused." </p><p>So the King set a guard upon Khipil to see that his orders were executed, and appointed a time for him to return to the gardens. </p><p>At the hour indicated Khipil stood before Shahpesh again. He was pale, saddened; his tongue drooped like the tongue of a heavy bell, that when it soundeth giveth forth mournful sounds only: he had also the look of one battered with many beatings. So the King said, "How of thy presentation of the flowers of thy culture, O Khipil?" </p><p>He answered "Surely, O King, she received me with wrath, and I am shamed by her." </p><p>And the King said, "How of my clemency in the matter of the chafing?" </p><p>Khipil answered, "O King of splendours! I made petition to my neighbours whom I met, accosting them civilly and with imploring, for I ached to chafe, and it was the very raging thirst of desire to chafe that was mine, devouring intensity of eagerness for solace of chafing. And they chafed me, O King; yet not in those parts which throbbed for the chafing, but in those which abhorred it."</p><p>Then Shahpesh smiled and said, "'Tis certain that the magnanimity of monarchs is as the rain that falleth, the sun that shineth: and in this spot it fertilizeth richness; in that encourageth rankness. So art though but a weed, O Khipil! and my grace is thy chastisement." </p><p>We hope we have said, if not enough to do justice to "The Shaving of Shagpat," enough to make our readers desire to see it. They will find it, compared with the other fictions which the season has provided, to use its own Oriental style, "as the apple tree among the trees of the wood." </p><p>INTRODUCTION TO GENESIS. </p><p>Introduction to the Book of Genesis, with a Commentary on the Opening Portion. From the German of Dr. Von Bohlen. Edited by James Heywood, M.P. In 2 vols. </p><p>	London: John Chapman.</p><p>WHAT is the office of the Biblical critic in relation to the Old Testament? There are various answers to this question. </p><p>Extreme orthodoxy says that since there is irrefragable external evidence for the Divine origin and direct verbal inspiration of the Hebrew Scriptures, the critic has simply to interpret the meaning of the text; any record which is in contradiction with the text, if not reconcileable by hypothesis, is to be pronounced false; but if an undeniable fact turns out to be in contradiction with the text, the received interpretation is to be reconsidered and altered so as to agree with the undeniable fact. According to this theory the critic has not to examine the Hebrew writings in order to ascertain their origin, but having beforehand settled their origin, he has to explain everything so as to make it accord with this premise. He is not an inquirer, but an advotee. He has not to weigh evidence in order to arrive at a conclusion, but having arrived at a conclusion, he has to make it the standard by which he accepts or rejects evidence. His criticism is a deductive process, which has for its axiom, The Hebrew writings are from beginning to end revealed truth. And it is only while orthodoxy strictly adheres to this point of view that it is on safe and consistent ground; for if we are to examine a book for proof--though it be only confirmatory proof--of its origin, we must have some criteria to judge it by, and we can only obtain such criteria by borrowing them from pure historical criticism, an ally that must be ultimately incompatible with rigid orthodoxy. As long as we rely implicitly on testimony as evidence of a man's health, we have no need to examine the indication of health in his person; but the moment we feel the testimony insufficient, we must have recourse to physiological criteria, which are common to every human organism. </p><p>The first symptom that orthodoxy begins to feel the pressure of historical criticism is shown in an extension of the "accommodation" theory. As the Deity, it is said, in speaking to human beings, must use human language, and consequently anthropomorphic expressions, such as the "eye of God," the "arm of God," the "laughter and jealousy of God," which we have no difficulty in understanding figuratively, so he must adapt the form of His revelations to the degree of culture, which belongs to men at the period in which His revelations are made. He teaches tham as a father teaches his children, by adapting the information he gives to their narrow stock of ideas. It was in this way that the candid Dr. Pye Smith explained the narratives of the Creation and the Deluge, to the great scandal of his Evangelical brethern. It is easy to see that their system of interpretation is very elastic, and that it may soon amount to little more than a theological formula for th history of human development is analogous to the relation between the doctrine that the brain is the organ of mind, and the doctrine that mind is the fuction of the brain; in both cases the manifestations of mind is determined by the conditions of the body. And thus the  accommodation  theory necessarily leads to what may be called a mitigated orthodoxy or a mild heterodoxy, which allows the presence of mythical and legendary elements in the Hebrew records, and renounces the idea that they are from beginning to end infallible, but still regards them as the medium of a special revelation, as the shell that held a kernel of peculiarly Divine truth, by which a monotheistic faith was preserved, and the way prepared for the Christian dispensation. They who hold this theory believe that the Hebrew nation was the grandest instrument of Providence--the Hebrew writings, the vehicle of supernatural truth; but they do not believe in talking serpents and talking assess, or in divine commands to butcher men wholesale; and they hold that, to identify a belief in such fables with the faith of a Christian, is as dangerous to reverence as it would be to fix an absurd popinjay on the divine symbol of the Cross. The laws of Moses are something more to them than the laws of Menu--a Hebrew prophet something more than a religious and patriotic poet; a chapter of Isaiah something more than the Hymn of Cleanthes. They do not feel about the Hebrew temple and the Hebrew worship as they feel about a temple of Isis or the Eleusinian mysteries: the history of Israel is a sacred precinct to them--they take their shoes from off their feet, for it is holy ground. To them, therefore, the Old Testament is still an exceptional book; they only use historical criticism as a winnowing fan to carry away all demands on their belief, which are not strictly involved in their acceptance of Christianity as a special revelation.</p><p>Extreme heterodoxy, on the contrary, holds the conviction that renounces the Hebrew scriptures from the common category of national records, which are a combination of myth and legend, gradually clarifying as they step into genuine history. It enters on the examination of the Old Testament with as perfect a freedom from pre-suppositions, as unreserved a submission to the guidance of historical criticism, as if it were examining the Vedas, the Zendavesta, or the fragments of Manetho and Sanchoniathon. On thus, it looking at the Hebrew records by the "light of common day," without the lamp of faith, heterodoxy finds in them no evidence of anything exceptionally divine, but sees in them simply the history and literature of a barbarous tribe that gradually rose from fetishism to a ferocious polytheism, offering human sacrifices, and ultimately, through the guidance of their best men, and contact with more civilized nations, to Jehovistic monotheism. It finds in them, as in other early records, a mythical cosmogony, an impossible chronology, and extravagant marvels tending to flatter national vanity or to aggrandize a priesthood; it finds discordant conceptions of Deity in documents attributed to one and the same source; it finds legislative enactments, springing from an advanced period, stamped with the sanction of primeval names, or of mythical crises in the national history; in short, it not only finds in the Hebrew writings nothing which cannot be accounted for on grounds purely human, but it finds them of a character which it would be monstrous to attribute to any other than a human origin. </p><p>These are results arrived at in the present day by very grave and competent scholars, and whatever opinion may be held concerning them, no educated person can dispense with some knowledge of the evidence on which they are based. There are few books, at least in English, better adapted to give such knowledge in a concise form than the Introduction to Genesis by Von Bohlen, named at the head of our article. Von Bohlen s was a thoroughly earnest and reverent mind, and orthodox believers need never be shocked by his manner, if they are inevitably pained by his matter. To this admirable qualification he added that of immense learning, especially in the department of Hindoo literature, his fame having been first won by his work on "Ancient India." We have only to regret that Mr. Heywood did not heighten the value of his disinterested labour in editing the Introduction to Genesis by publishing it in a cheaper and more portable form.</p><p>The first volume is chiefly occupied with consideration on the origin and character of the Pentateuch or five books of Moses generally, considerations which embrace the course of Hebrew history until after the Captivity, or transplantation to Babylon. Every important particular is discussed clearly and briefly but not scantily, and the reader, though they may not accept Von Bohlen's conclusions, is placed in an ecellent position for pursuing the investigation by a closer study of the Scriptures themselves. Mr. Heywood has added in an appendix to this volume the valuable remarks of Von Bohlen on the Week, extracted from his Ancient India. </p><p>The second volume contains a commentary on the opening portion of Genesis. Von Bohlen wrote a commentary on the whole book, but the translation is limited to the first ten chapters which comprise the important narratives of the Creation, the Fall, the Flood, and the Dispersion of mankind. Mr. Heywood has enriched this volume by notes and by additional remarks on the flood; he has also inserted some interesting extracts on this subject and on the Paradisaic myth from Professor Tuck's Commentary on Genesis. </p><p>Instead of quoting from the more argumentative and critical portion of the volumes, which would not be effective in the cursory reading usually given to newspapers, we will borrow from them an admirable Hebrew myth which has arisen since the Christian era. We cannot agree with Von Bohlen that it is 'true to the spirit of antiquity.' The tolerance it breathes is unknown to the Books of the Law:-- </p><p>Pococke is said to have actually found this chapter in a manuscript at Cairo. The Talmud too is supposed to have been acquainted with it. Saadi alludes to it in his 'Bustan' (see Asiat. Journ. iii. 315). Taylor cites it in the middle of the seventeenth century, and it has now become </p><p>generally known through the means of Franklin [by whom it was communicated to Lord Karnes], who quotes it in his 'Sketches' as a parable against intolerance. It runs as follows:-- </p><p>1. Now it came to pass that Abraham sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. 2. And behold a man drew nigh from the wilderness,and he was bowed down with age, and his white beard hung down even to his girdle, and he leant upon his staff. 3. And when Abraham saw him he stood up, and ran to meet him from the door of his tent, and said, 4. Friend, come in; water shall be brought thee to wash thy feet, and thou shalt eat and tarry the night, and on the morrow thou mayest go on thy way. 5. But the wayfaring man answered and said, Let me, I pray thee, remain under the tree. 6. And Abraham pressed him sore; then he turned and went into the tent. 7. And Abraham set before him cream and milk and cake, and they eat and were satisfied. 8. And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God, he said to him, Wherefore dost thou not honour the Almighty, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? 9. And the man answered, I worship not thy God, neither do I call upon his name; for I have mad gods for myself that dwell in any house, and hear me when I call upon the. 10. Then the wrath of Abraham was kindled against the man, and he stood up and fell upon him, and drove him forth into the wilderness. 11. And God cried, Abraham! Abraham! and Abraham answered, Here am I. 12.And God said, where is the stranger that was with thee? 13. Then answered Abraham and said, Lord, he would not reverence thee nor call upon thy name, and therefore have I driven him from before my face into the wilderness. 14. And the Lord said unto Abraham, Have I borne with the man these hundred and ninety-eight years, and given him food and raiment although he has rebelled against me, and canst thou not bear with him one night? 15. And Abraham said, Let not the wrath of my Lord be kindled against his servant, behold I have sinned! forgive me. 16. And Abraham stood up and went forth into the wilderness. and cried and sought the man, and found him and led him back into his tent, and dealt kindly by him, and the next morning he let him go in peace.</p><p>HISTORY OF GERMAN PROTESTANTISM. </p><p>Internal History German Protestantism since the Middle of the Last Century. By Dr. Kahnis. Translated from the German by the Rev. Theodore: Meyer. </p><p>Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark. </p><p>As naturalists tell us that the animals of the Old World are represented by </p><p>analogous, but not by identical species in the New, so the various forms of religious opinion amongst us are represented by corresponding but not precisely similar forms in Germany. The Anglican Churchman is ipso verbo a purely English product; but his species bas its German analogue in the extreme Lutheran party, which has been urged into a rigid and vehement assertion of its peculiar tenets by the unsuccessful attempt of the late and actual Kings of Prussia to effect a union between the two great branches of German Protestantism known as the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. The opinions of the "High" Lutherans concerning the authority of the Church and the efficacy of the Sacraments, resemble, with a difference not, let us hope, lutely fatal, those of our more geographically favoured Anglicans, and among the other indications of kinship, a certain arrogance of tone is not wanting. To this extreme Lutheran party belongs Dr. Kabnis, the author of the compact History of German Protestantism of which we have the translation before us. His opinion as to the "rule of faith " may be gathered from the following observations:-- </p><p>To go thus immediately back to Scripture, appears, at first sight, as the truly free proceeding, and yet, at the same time, truly bound ; in one word, as the  truly Protestant proceeding. But if every Protestant divine were to expound , Scripture in his own way, were himself to form the doctrines, and to shape their building according to his own method,--what would be the result? A chaos of stand-points atomistically crossing one another, with which no Church, no sound science would be possible. Behind this apparent objectivity, an unbounded subjectivity is concealed. Men so rich in intellect and spirit as Beck, must not influence the opinion as to what the stand-point is in itself. If the Protestant Church calls the Scriptures the rule of the doctrines of faith, it does not thereby say that Scripture is the source of them. Even before the books of the New Testament were written and collected, there existed in the congregations a consciousness of faith. It was founded upon the oral word of the Apostles, and very early, according to the Confession at Baptism, assumed the form of rules of faith, which were regarded as the sum and substance of both the oral and written word. The first Dogmatik (Origen on the Fundamental Doctrines) proceeds from the rule of the faith. This rule of faith is, for the Evangelical Lutheran Church, her confession, of which she is convinced that it is at one with the confession of the Catholic Church, as is declared in the Augsburg confession, at the close, and in the formula concordiae at the commencement. Every dogmatik has anew to compare the doctrine of the confessions with the rule and measure of Scripture; it has merely, in a scientific manner, to evolve the confession, but not to produce it from Scripture itself. It may be that the argumentation from Scripture comes into contradiction with the confession of the Church, inasmuch as it is, after all, of human origin. But, without prejudice to the rights of Protestantism and</p><p>science, we may well demand from our divines, that they shall not consider their own opinion to be infallible, while they assert the fallibility of the Church. </p><p>Having thus forewarned the reader of the point of view from which Dr. Kahnis' little book is written, we may recommend it to him, in the absence of better and equally accessible books on the same subject as a useful and compendious survey. The information that can be given on so great a subject in about three hundred duodeeimo pages is necessarily scanty, but it is rendered un-necessarily so by an unwise expenditure of space on gossiping biographical details, which ought to have no place in a rapid historical sketch. Dr Kahnis seems, especially, tempted to give such details when they are disadvantageous to those whom he regards as heterodox. An example of his very bad taste in this way is hins gratuitous mention of a private, and, as he thinks reprehensible relation of Schleiermacher's in early life. The other defects which might be pointed out in the book are chiefly theoretic, and will not be recognised as defects by those who share the author's theological position.</p><p>We wish our criticism could stop here, but the inquiry that is constantly being done to the reading public by the issue of defective translations, renders it a duty reviewers to allow no case of the kind to pass unnoticed. The Rev. Theodore Meyer, as we gather from his preface to his translation, is a German; it is not surprising, therefore, that is English should be thickly inlaid with German idioms, but it is surprising that publishers who risk large sums on the reproduction of foreign works should not be more careful to secure a respectable quality of translation. Throughout this volume we are constantly meeting with such sentences as these: "For I know as little as nothing when I am told that some one has, however openly, declared, twenty-two years ago, for something by which I believe, even to-day no one knows to think of anything definite and distinct, as little as twenty-two years ago." . . . I don't observe almost anything at all." . . . "Spinoza's substance had no personal life, without the things no personality," &amp;c. &amp;c. </p><p>Translators, as a class, seem to want impressing with the wholesome truth that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well. They are "brokers in the great intellectual traffic of the world"--a function not so high as that of the producers, but one which it is of manifest importance to have carefully and honestly fulfilled. </p><p>THE ANTIGONE AND ITS MORAL. </p><p>The Antigone of Sophocles.

Sophocles is the crown and flower of the classic tragedy as Shakespeare is of the romantic to borrow Schlegel's comparison, which cannot be improved upon, they are related to each other as the Parthenon to Strasburg Cathedral. </p><p>The opinion which decrees all enthusiasn for Greek literature as "humbug," was put to an excellent test some years ago by the production of the Antigone at Drury Lane. The translation then adopted was among the feeblest by which a great poet has ever been misrepresented yet so completely did the poet triumph over the disadvantages of his medium and of a dramatic motive foreign to modern sympathies, that the Pit was electrified, and Sophocles, over a chasm of two thousand years, once more swayed the emotions of a popular audience. And no wonder. The Antigone has every quality of a fine tragedy, and fine tragedies can never become mere mummies for Hermanns and Böckhs to dispute about: they must appeal to perennial human nature and even the ingenious dulness of translators cannot exhaust them of their passion and their poetry. </p><p>	"E"en in their ashes live their wonted fire."</p><p>We said that the dramatic motive of the Antigone was foreign to modern sympathies, but it is only superficially so. It is true we no longer believe that a brother, if left unburied, is condemned to wander a hundred years without repose on the banks of the Styx; we no longer believe that to neglect funeral rites is to violate the claims of infernal deities. But these "beliefs" are the accidents and not the substance of the poet's conception. The turning point of the tragedy is no, as it is stated to he in the argument prefixed to this editor "reverence for the dead and the importance of the sacred rites of burial" but the conflict between these and obedience to the State. Here lies the dramatic collusion: the impulse of sisterly piety which allies itself with reverence for the Gods, clashes with the duties of citizenship; two principles, both having their validity, are at war with each Let us glance for a moment at the plot.</p><p>Eteocles and Polynices, the brothers of Antigone, have slain each other in battle before the gates of Thebes, the one defending his country, the other invading in conjunction with foreign allies. Hence Creon becomes, by the death of these two son of Œdipus, the legitimate ruler of Thebes, grants funeral honours to Eteocles, but denies them to Polynices, whose body is cast out to be the prey of beasts and birds, a decree being issued that death will be the penalty of an attempt to bury him. In the second scene of the play Creon expounds the motive of his decree to the Theban elders, insisting in weighty words on the duty of making all personal affection subordinating to the well-being of the State. The impulses of affection and religion which urge Antigone to disobey the proclamation are strengthened by the fact that in her last interview with her brother he had besought her not to leave his corpse unburied. She determines to brave the penalty, buries Polynices, is taken in the act and brought before Creon, to whom she does not attempt to deny that she knew of the proclamation, but declares that she deliberately disobeyed it, and is ready to accept death as its consequence. It was not Zeus, she tells him—it was not eternal Justice that issued that decree. The proclamation of Creon is not so authoritative as the unwritten law of the Gods, which is neither of to-day nor of yesterday, but lives eternally, and none know its beginning. </p><p>	[? Greek lettering]</p><p>Creon, on his side, insists on the necessity to the welfare of the State that he should be obeyed as legitimate ruler, and becomes exasperated by the calm defiance of Antigone. She is condemned to death. Haemon, the son of Creon, to whom Antigone is betrothed remonstrates against this judgment in vain. Teiresiss also, the blind old soothsayer, alarmed by unfavorable omens, comes to warn Creon against persistence in a course displeasing to the Gods. It is not until he has departed, leaving behind him the denunciation of coming woes, that Creon's confidence begins to falter, and at length, persuaded by the Theban elders, reverses his decree, and proceeds with his followers to the rocky tomb in which Antigone had been buried alive, that he may deliver her. It is too late. Antigone is already dead. Haemon commits suicide in the madness of despair, and the death of his mother Eurydice on hearing the fatal tidings, completed the ruin of Creon's house. </p><p>It is very superficial criticism which interprets the character of Creon as that of a hypocritical tyrant, and regards Antigone as a blameless victim. Coarse contrasts like this are not the materials handled by great dramatists. The exquisite are of Sophocles is shown in the touches by which hemakes us feel that Creon, as well as Antigone, is contending for what he believes to be the right, while both are also conscious that, in following out one principle, they are laying themselves open to just blame for transgressing another; and it is this consciousness which secretly heightens the exasperation of Creon and the defiant hardness of Antigone. The best critics have agreed with Böckh in recognising this balance of principles, this antagonism between valid claims; they generally regard it, however, as dependent entirely on the Greek point of view as springing simply from the polytheistic conception, according to which the requirements of the Gods often clashed with the duties of man to man. </p><p>But, is it the fact that this antagonism of valid principles is peculiar to polytheism? Is it not rather that the struggle between Antigone and Creon represents that struggle between elemental tendencies and established laws by which the outer life of man is gradually and painfully being brough into harmony with his inward needs. Until this harmony is perfected, we shall never be able to attain a great right without also doing a wrong. Reformers, martyrs, revolutionist are never fighting against evil only; they are also placing themselves in opposition to a good—to a valid principle which cannot be infringed without harm. Resist the payment of ship-money, you bring on evil wars, preach against false doctrines, you disturb feeble minds and send them adrift on a sea of doubt; make a new road and you annihilate vested interests; cultivate a new region of the earth, and you exterminate a race of men. Wherever the strength of a man's intellect, or moral sense, or affection brings him into opposition with the rules which society has sanctioned, there is renewed the conflict between Antigone and Creon; such a man must not only dare to be right, he must also dare to be wrong—to shake faith, to wound friendship, perhaps, to hem in his own powers. Like Antigone, he may fall a victim to the struggles and yet he can never earn the name of a blameless martyr any more than the society—the Creon he has defied, can be branded as a hypocritical tyrant.</p><p>Perhaps the best moral we can draw is that to which the Chrous points—that our protest for the right should be seasoned with moderation and reverence, and that lofty words—[? Greek words]—are not becoming to mortals. </p><p>ART AND BELLES LETTRES (APRIL 1856). </p><p>OUR table this time does not, according to the favourite metaphor, "groan under the light literature of the quarter, for the quarter has not been very productive; but, in compensation, we ourselves groan under rather more than usual, for the harvest is principally of straw, and few grains of precious corn remain after the winowing. We accept one book, however, which is a precious sheaf in itself, and will serve as bread, and seed-corn too, for many days. We mean the new volume of Mr. Ruskin s "Modern Painters" to which he appropriately gives the subordinate title, "Of Many Things.  It may be taken up with equal pleasure whether the reader be acquainted or not with the previous volumes, and no special artistic culture is necessary in order to enjoy its excellences or profit by</p><p>----- </p><p>1 "Modern Painters" By John Ruskin. Vol. 3. London: Smith and Elder. </p><p>its suggestions. Every one who cares about nature, or poetry, or the story of human development--every one who has a tinge of literature or philosophy, will find something that is for him and that will "gravitate to him,  in this volume. Since its predecessors appeared, Mr. Ruskin has devoted ten years to the loving study of his great subject -the principles of art; which, like all other great subjects, carries the student into many fields. The critic of art, as he tells us,  has to take some note of optics, geometry, geology, botany, and anatomy; he must acqaint himself with the works of all great artists, and with the temper and history of the times in which they lived; he must be fair metaphysician, and a</p><p>careful observer of the phenomena of natural scenery." And when writer like Mr. Ruskin brings these varied studies to bear on one great purpose, when he has to trace their common relation to a grand phase of human activity, it is obvious that he will have a great deal to say which is of interest and importance to others besides painters. The fundamental principles of all just thought and beautiful action or creation are the same, and in making clear to ourselves what </p><p>best and noblest in art, we are making clear to ourseves what is best and noblest in morals; in learning how to estimate the artistic products of a particular age according to the mental attitde and external life of that age, we are widening our sympathy and deepening the basis of our tolerance and charity. </p><p>Of course, this treatise "Of many things  presents certain old characteristics and new paradoxes which will furnish fresh text to antagonistic critics; but, happily for us, and happily for our readers, who probably care more to know what Mr. Ruskin says than what other people think he ought to say, we are not among those who are more irritated by his faults than charmed and subdued by his merits. When he announces to the world in his Preface, that he is incapable of falling into an illogical deduction- that whatever other mistakes he may commit, he cannot possibly draw an inconsequent conclusion, we are not indignant, but amused, and do not in the least feel ourselves under the necessity of picking holes in his arguments in order to prove that he is not a logical Pope. We value writer not in proportion to his freedom from faults, but in proportion to his positive excellences--to the variety of thought he contributes and suggests, to the amount of gladdening and energizing emotions he excites. Of what comparative importance is it that Mr. Ruskin undervalues this painter, overvalues the other, that he sometimes glides from a just argument into a fallacious one, that he is a little absurd here, and not a little arrogant there, if, with all these collateral mistakes, he teaches truth of infinite value, and so teaches it that men will listen? The truth of infinite value that he teaches in realism--the doctine that all truth and beauty are to be attained by a humble and faithful study of nature, and not by substituting vague forms, bred by imagination on the mists of feeling, in place of definite, substantial reality. The thorough acceptance of this doctrine would remould our life; and he who teaches its application to any one department of human activity with such power as Mr. Ruskin s, is a prophet for his generation. It is not enough simply to teach truth; that may be done, as we all know, to empty walls, and within the covers of unsaleable books; we want it to be so taught as to compel men s attention and sympathy. Very correct singing of very fine music will avail little without a voice that can thrill the audience and take possession of their souls. Now, Mr. Ruskin has a voice, and one of such power, that whatever error he may mix with his truth, he will make more converts to that truth than less erring advocates who are hoarse and feeble. Considered merely as a writer,he is in the very highest rank of English stylists. The vigour and splendour of his eloquence are not more remarkable than its precision, and the delicate truthfulness of his epithets. The fine large of his sentences reminds us more of De Quincy than of any other writer, and his tendency to digressiveness is another and less admirable point of resemblance to the English Opium-eater. Yet we are not surprised to find that he does not mention De Quincy among the favourite writers who have influenced him, for Mr. Ruskin s style is evidently due far more to innate faculty than to modifying influences; and though he himself thinks that his constant study of Carlyle must have impressed itself on his language as well as his thought, we rarely detect this. In the point of view from which he looks at a subject, in the correctness of his descriptions, and in a certain rough flavour of humour, he constantly reminds us of Carlyle, but in the mere tissue of his style, scarcely ever. But while we are dilating on Mr. Ruskin s general characteristics, we are robbing ourselves of the room we want for what is just now more important- namely, telling the reader something about the contents of the particular volume before us.</p><p>It opens with a discussion of the  Grand Style,  which, after an analysis and dismissal of Sir Joshua Reynolds s opinion, that it consists in attending to what is invariable, "the great and general ideas only inherent in universal nature, Mr. Ruskin concludes to be the suggestion by the imagination of noble grounds for noble emotions.  The conditions on which this result depends are, first, the choice of noble subjects, i. e. subjects which involve wide interests and profound passions, as opposed to those which involve narrow interests and slight passions. And the choice which charaeterises the school of high art, is seen as much in the treatment of the subject as the selection. "For the artist who sincerely chooses the noblest subject, will also choose chiefly to represent what makes that subject noble, namely, the various heroism or other noble emotions of the persons represented.  But here two dangers present themselves: that of superseding expression by technical excellence, as when Paul Veronese makes the Supper at Emmaus a background to the portraits of two children playing with a dog; and that of superseding technical excellence by expression.</p><p>"This is usually done under the influence of another kind of vanity. The artist desires that men should think he has an elevated soul, affects to despise the ordinary excellence of art, contemplates with separated egotism the course of </p><p>his own imaginations or sensations, and refuses to look at the real facts around and about him, in order that he may adore at leisure the shadow of himself. He lives in an element of what he calls tender emotions and lofty aspirations; which are, in fact, nothing more than very ordinary weaknesses or instincts, contemplated through a mist of pride. </p><p>The second condition of greatness of style is love of beauty--the tendency to introduce into the conception of the subject as much beauty as is possible, consistently with truth. </p><p> The corruption of the schools of high art, so far as this particular quality is concerned, consists in the sacrifice of truth to beauty. Great art dwells on all that is beautiful; but false art omits or changes all that is ugly. Great art accepts nature as she is, but directs the eyes and thoughts to what is most perfect in her; false art saves itself the trouble of direction, by removing or altering whatever it thinks objectionable. The evil results are twofold.</p><p>"First. That beauty deprived of its proper foils and adjuncts ceases to be enjoyed as beauty, just as light deprived of all shadow ceases to be enjoyed as light. A white canvas cannot produce an effect of sunshine; the painter must darken it in some places before he can make it luminous in others; nor can uninterrupted succession of beauty produce the true effect of beauty; it must </p><p>be foiled by inferiority before its own power can be developed. Nature has for the be most part mingled her inferior and nobler elements as she mingles sunshine with shade, giving due use and influence to both; and the painter who chooses to remove the shadow, perishes in the burning desert he has created. The truly high and beautiful art of Angelico is continually refreshed and strengthened by his frank portraiture of the most ordinary features of his brother monks, and of the recorded peculiarities of ungainly sanctity; but the modern German and Raphaelesque schools lose all honour and nobleness in barber-like admiration of handsome faces, and have, in fact, no real faith except in straight noses and curled hair. Paul Veronese opposes the dwarf to the soldier, and the negress to the queen; Shakspeare places Caliban beside Miranda, and Autolycus beside Perdita; but the vulgar idealist withdraws his beauty to the safety of the saloon, and his innocence to the seclusion of the cloister; he pretends that he does this in delicacy of choice and purity of sentiment, while in truth he has neither courage to front the monster nor wit enough to furnish the knave. </p><p>"It is only by habit of representing faithfully all things, that we can truly learn what is beautiful, and what is not. The ugliest objects contain some element of beauty; and in all, it is an element peculiar to themselves, which cannot be separated from their ugliness, but must either </p><p>be enjoyed together with it, or not all. The more </p><p>a painter accepts nature as he finds it, the more </p><p>unexpected beauty he discovers in what he at first despised; but once let him arrogate the right of rejection, and he will gradually contract his circle of enjoyment, until what be supposed to be noble ends in narrowness of perception. Dwelling perpetually upon one class of ideas, his art becomes at once monstrous and morbid; until at last he cannot faithfully represent even what he chooses to retain; his discrimination contracts into darkness, and his fastidiousness fades into fatuity." </p><p>The third characteristic of great art is sincerity. The artist should include the largest possible quantity of truth in the most perfect possible harmony. All the truths of nature cannot be given; hence a choice must be made of some facts which can be represented from amongst others which must be passed by in silence. "The inferior artist chooses unimportant and scattered truths; the great artist chooses the most necessary first, and afterwards the most consistent with these, so as to obtain the greatest possible and most harmonious scene.  Thus, Rembrandt sacrifices all other effects to the representation of the exact force with which the light on the most illumined part of an objectis opposed to its obscurer portions. Paul Veronese, on the contrary, endeavours to embrace all the great relations of visible objects; and this difference between him and Rembrandt as to</p><p>light and shade is typical of the difference between great and inferior artists throughout the entire field of art. He is the greatest who con veys the largest sum of truth. And as the sum of truth can always be increased by delicacy of handling, it follows </p><p>"That all great art must have this delicacy to the utmost possible degree. This rule is infallible and inflexible. All coarse work is the sign of low art. Only, it is to be remembered, that coarseness must be estimated by the distance from the eye; it being necessary to consult this distance, when great, by laying on touches which appear coarse when seen near; but which, so far from being coarse, are, in reality, more delicate in a master s work than the finest close handling, for they involve a calculation of result, and are laid on with a subtlety of sense precisely correspondent to that with which a good archer draws his bow; the spectator seeing in the action nothing but the strain of the strong arm, in reality, in the finger and eye, an ineffably delicate estimate of distance, and touch on the arrow plume. </p><p>The last characteristic of great art is invention. It must not only present grounds for noble emotion, but must furnish these grounds by imagination power, i. e. by an inventive combination of distinctly known objects. Thus imaginative art includes the historical faculties, which simply represent observed facts, but renders these faculties subservient to poetic purpose. </p><p>"And now, finally, since this poetical power includes the historical, if we glance back to the other qualities required in great art, and put all together, we find that the sum of them </p><p>simply the sum of all power of man. For as (1) the choice of high subject involves all conditions of right moral choice, and as (2) the love of beauty involves all conditions of right admiration, and as (3) the grasp of truth involves all strength of sense, evenness of judgment, and honesty of purpose, and as (4) the poetical power involves all swiftness of invention, and accuracy of historical memory, the sum of all these powers </p><p>is the sum of the human soul. Hence we see why the word 'Great' is used of this art. It is literally great. It compasses and calls forth the entire human spirit, whereas any other kind of art, being more or less small or narrow, compasses and calls forth only part of the human spirit. Hence the idea of its magnitude is a literal and just one, the art being simply less or greater in proportion to the number of faculties it exercises and addresses. And this is the ultimate meaning of the definition I gave of it long ago, as containing the  greatest number of the greatest ideas. "</p><p>We have next a discussion of the False Ideal, </p><p>and first of all, in Religious Art. The want of realization in the early religious painters prevented their pictures from being more than suggestions to the feelings. They attempted to express, not the actual fact, but their own enthusiasm about the fact; they covered the Virgin s dress with gold, not with any idea of representing her as she ever was or will be seen, but with a burning desire to show their love for her. As art advanced in technical power and became more realistic, there arose the treatment of religious subjects; more pernicious because it was more likely to be representation of fact.</p><p>"Take a very important instance. </p><p>"I suppose there is no event in the whole life of  Christ to which, in hours of doubt or fear, men turn with more anxious thirst to know the close facts of it, or with more earnest and passionate dwelling every syllable of its recorded narrative, than Christ showing Himself to his disciples at the lake of Galilee. There is something preeminently open, natural, full fronting our disbelief in this manifestation. The others, recorded after the resurrection, were sudden, phantom-like, occurring to men in profound sorrow and wearied agitation of heart; not, it might seem, safe judges of what they saw. But the agitation was now over. They had gone back to their daily work, thinking still their business lay net-wards, unmeshed from the literal rope and drag. Simon Peter saith them. 'I go a fishing.' They say unto him, 'We also go with thee.  words enough, and having far echo Galilean hills. That night they caught nothing; but when the morning came, in the clear light of it, behold, a figure stood on the shore. They were not thinking of anything but their fruitless hauls. They had no guess who it was. It asked them simply if they had caught anything. They said no. And it them to cast yet again. And John shades his eyes from the morning sun with his hand, to look who it is; and though the glinting of the sea, too, dazzles him, he makes out who it is, at last; and poor Simon, not to be outrun this time, tightens his fisher's coat about him, and dashes it over the nets. One would have liked so see him swim those hundred yards, and stagger to his knees on the beach.</p><p>"Well, the others get to the beach, too, in time, in such slow way as men in general do get, in this world, to its true shore, much impeded by that wonderful  dragging the net with fishes;' but they get there -seven of them in all; first the Denier, and then the slowest believer, and then the quickest believer, and then the two throne-seekers, and two more, we know not who.</p><p>"They sit down on the shore face to face with Him, and eat their broiled fish as He bids. And then, to Peter, all dripping still, shivering, and amazed, staring at Christ in the sun, on the other side of the little coal fire,--thinking a little, perhaps, of what happened by another coal fire, when it was colder, and having had no word once changed with him by his Master since that look of His,--to him, so amazed, comes the question, 'Simon, lovest thou me!  Try to feel that a little, and think of it till it is true to you; and then, take up that infinite monstrosity and hypocrisy--Raphael s cartoon of the Charge to Peter. Note, first, the bold fallacy--the putting all the Apostles there, a mere lie to serve the Papal heresy of the Petric supremacy, by putting them all in the background while Peter receives the charge, and making them all witnesses to it. Note the handsomely curled hair and neatly tied sandals of the men who had been out all night in the sea-mists and on the slimy decks. Note their convenient dresses for going a-fishing, with trains that lie a yard along the ground, and goodly fringes,--all made to match, an apostolic fishing costume. Note how Peter especially (whose chief glory was in his wet coat girt about him and naked limbs) is enveloped in folds and fringes, so as to kneel and hold his keys with grace. No fire of coals at all, nor lonely mountain shore, but a pleasant Italian landscape, full of villas and churches, and a flock of sheep to be pointed at; and the whole group of Apostles, not round Christ, as they would have been naturally, but straggling away in a line, that they may all be shown.</p><p>"The simple truth is, that the moment we look at the picture we feel our belief of the whole thing taken away. There is, visibly, no possibility of that group ever having existed, in any place, or on any occasion. It is all a mere mythic absurdity, and faded concoction of fringes, muscular arms, and curly heads of Greek philosophers.  </p><p>Mr. Ruskin glances rapidly at the False Ideal in profane art--the pursuit of mere physical beauty as a gratification to the idle senses; and then enters into an extended consideration of the True Ideal, distinguished by him into three branches. 1. Purist Idealism, which results from the unwillingness of pure and tender minds the to contemplate evil, of which Angelico is the great example, among the early painters; and among the moderns, Stothard exhibits the same tendency in the treatment of wordly subjects. 2. Naturalist Idealism, which accepts the weaknesses, faults, and wrongnesses in all things that it sees, but so places them that they form noble whole, in which the imperfection of each is not only harmless, but absolutely essential, and yet in which whatever is good in each several part shall be completely displayed. 3. The Grotesque Ideal, which is either playful, terrible, or symbolical. The essences of an admirable chapter on  Finish  is, that all real, finish is not mere polish, but added truth. Great artists finish not to show their skill, nor to produce a smooth piece of work, but to render clearer the expression of knowledge.</p><p>We resist the temptation to quote any of the very fine things Mr. Ruskin says about the "Use of Pictures,  and pass on to the succeeding chapter, in which he enters on his special subject, namely, landscape painting. With that intense interest in landscape which is peculiar characteristic of modern times, is associated the "Pathetic Fallacy --the transference to external objects of the spectator s own emotions, as when Kingsley says of the drowned maiden,--</p><p>	"They rowed her in across the rolling foam--</p><p>	The cruel, crawling foam.  </p><p>The pleasure which we derive from this fallacy is legitimate when the passion in which it originates is strong, and has an adequate cause. But the mental condition which admits of this fallacy is of a lower order than that in which, </p><p>while the emotions are strong, the intellect </p><p>is yet strong enough to assert its rule against them; and "the whole man stands in an iron glow, white hot, perhaps, but still strong, and in no wise evaporating; even if he melts, losing none of his weight.  Thus the poets who delight in this fallacy are chiefly of the second order--the reflective and perceptive--such as Wordsworth, Keats, and Tennyson; while the creative poets, for example, Shakspeare, Homer, and Dante, use it sparingly.</p><p>Next follows one of the most delightful and suggestive chapters in the volume, on  Classical Landscape,  or the way in which the Greeks looked at external nature. Take a specimen on the details of the Homeric landscape:--</p><p>"As far as I recollect, without single exception, to be beautiful, is composed of a fountain, a meadow and a shady grove. This ideal is very interestingly marked, as intended for a perfect on, in the fifth book of the 'Odyssey;' when Mercury himself stops for a moment, though on a message to look at a landscape, 'which even an immortal might be gladdened to behold.' This landscape consists of a cave covered with a running vine, all blooming into graps, and surrounded by a grove of alder, poplar, and sweet-smelling cypress. Four fountains of white (foaming) water springing in succession (mark the oderliness), and close to one another, flow away in different directions, through a meadow full of violets and parsley (parsley, to mark its moisture, being elsewhere called marsh-nourised, and associated with the lotus); the air is perfumed no only by these violets and by the sweet cypress, but by Calypso's fire of finely chopped cedar wood, which sends a smoke, as of incense, through the island; Calypso herself is singing; and finally, upon the trees are resting, or roosting, owls, hawks, and 'long-tongued sea-crows.' Whether these last are considered as a part of the ideal landscape, as marine singing-birds, I know not; but the approval of Mercury appears to be elicited chiefly by the fountains and violet meadow.</p><p>"Now the notable things in this description are, first, the evident subservience of the whole landscape to human comfort, to the foot, the taste, or the smell; and secondly, that throughout the passage there is not a single figurative word expressing of the things being in any wise other than plain grass, fruit, or flower. I have used the term spring of the fountains,  because, without doubt, Homer means that they sprang forth brightly, having their source at the foot of the rocks (as copious fountains nearly always have); but Homer does not say spring,  he says simply flow, and uses only one word for  growing softly,  or richly,  of the tall trees, the vine, or the violets. There is, however, some expression of sympathy with the sea-birds; he speaks of them in precisely the same terms, as in other places of naval nations, saying they have care of the works of the sea.</p><p>"If we glance through the references to pleasant landscape which occur in other parts of the 'Odyssey,  we shall always be struck by this quiet subjection of their every feature to human service, and by the excessive similarity in the scenes. Perhapsthe spot intended, after this, to be most perfect, may be the garden of Alcinous, where the principal ideas are, still more definitely, order, symmetry, and fruitfulness; the beds being duly ranged between rows of vines, which, as well as the pear, apple, and fig-trees, bear fruit continually, some grapes being yet sour, while others are getting black; there are plenty of  orderly square beds of herbs, chiefly leeks, and two fountains, one running through the garden, and one under the pavement of the palace to a reservoir for the citizens. Ulysses, pausing to contemplate this scene, is described nearly in the same terms as Mercury, pausing to contemplate the wilder meadow; and it is interesting to observe, that, in spite of all Homer s love of symmetry, the god s admiration is excited by the free fountains, wild violets, and wanderingvine; but the mortal s, by the vines in rows, the leeks in beds, and the fountains in pipes.  </p><p>The mediaeval feeling for landscape is less utilitarian than the Greek. Everything is pleasurable and horticultural--the knights and ladies sing and make love in pleasaunces and rose gardens. There is a more sentimental enjoyment in external nature; but, added to this, there is a new respect for mountains, as places where a solemn presence is to be felt, and spiritual good obtained. As Homer is the grand authority for Greek landscape, so is Dante for the mediaeval; and Mr. Ruskin gives an elaborate study of the landscape in the  Divine Commedia.  To the love of brilliancy shown in mediaeval landscape, is contrasted the love of clouds in the modern, "so that if a general and characteristic name were needed for modern landscape art, none better could be found than  the service of clouds. " But here again Mr. Ruskin seeks for the spirit of landscape first of all in literature; and he expects to surprise his readers by selecting Scott as the typical poet, and greatest literary man of his age. He, very justly, we think, places Creative literature, such as Scott s, above Sentimental literature, even when this is of as high a character as in some passages of Byron or Tennyson.</p><p>"To invent a story, or admirably and thoroughly to grasp the entire mind of every personage concerned in it, and know precisely how they would be affected by what happens; which to do requires a colossal intellect; but to describe a separate emotion delicately, it is only needed that one should feel it oneself; and thousands of people are capable of feeling this or that noble emotion for one who is able to enter into all the feelings of somebody sitting on the other side of the table. . . . . I unhesitatingly receive as a greater manifestation of power the right invention of few sentences spoken by Pleydell and Mannering across their supper-table, than the most tender and passionate melodies of the self-examining verse."</p><p>This appreciation of Scott s power puts us in such excellent humour, that we are not inclined to quarrel with Mr. Ruskin about another judgment of his, to which we cannot see our way, in spite of the arguments he adduces. According to him Scott was eminently sad, sadder than Byron. On the other hand, he shows that this sadness did not lead Scott into the pathetic fallacy: the bird, the brook, the flower, and the cornfield, kept their gladsomeness for him, notwithstanding his own melancholy. But the more we look into Mr. Ruskin s volume, the more we want to quote or to question; so, remembering that we have other books to tell the reader about, we must shut this very seductive one, and content ourselves With merely mentioning the chapters on the  Moral of Landscape,  and on the Teachers of Turner,  which occupy the remaining pages; the latter preparing the way for the special consideration of Turner, which is to follow in the fourth volume. If the matter of this book had interested us less, we should, perhaps, have laid more stress on the illustrations, some of which are very beautiful: for example, a view of the Apennines by sunset, and a group of leaves and grasses, from the author s own pencil.</p><p>Another writer on art, who knows how to make his subject interesting to the uninitiated, is Adolf Stahr, the author of that very agreeable work on ancient art, "Torso,  the first volume of which we noticed a year ago. The second volume is now before us, and completes, in moderate compass, survey of Greek sculptural art from its earliest dawn to what may be called its faint afterglow under the Emperor Hadrian--a survey which we commend to all readers who are not already too well-informed on the subject to be glad of a guide learned enough, if he chose, to make an immense display of pedantry, but tasteful enough to choose the very opposite course, and not be pedantic at all. Perhaps, indeed, the majority of his readers would have liked him more frequently to interrupt the easy flow of his narrative and description by definite citation, and by a precise statement of the grounds on which he has adopted very decided opinion; but a thirst for full and accurate knowledge can be satisfied elsewhere, when once the thirst has been created, and for this last purpose few books can be better adapted than Professor Stahr s "Torso.  German critics will tell you that he is too enthusiastic and general in his admiration; but for our own part, since an author must be fallible, we prefer that his fallibility should lie in this direction, and that he should betray us into feeling too much rather than too little pleasure in the works of our fellow men. The second volume is not equal in interest to the first, but this diminution of interest lies in the nature of the subject; for, as the first volume carries us to the period of Alexander, and includes an account of the sculptures which owe their fundamental conception to the two great schools of Phidias and Praxiteles, a continuation necessarily implies a declension. Still, if we consider that, with the exception of the Parthenon sculptures, almost all the great works which form conception of Greek art as it was in the days of Greek glory, must be referred to the kindred genius or the reproductive skill of artists who lived in the period when Greek art was revived under Roman patronage, we shall hardly be indifferent to the fragmentary records which remain to us of artistic life and production in this period, and shall only regret that our know-</p><p>----- </p><p> "Torso.

London: David Nutt.</p><p>ledge of the atelier, where statues were wrought, is so much more scanty than our knowledge of the the palace for which statues were ordered. </p><p>The second volume of "Torso  opens with a survey of the Macedonian period in its relation to art. Under Alexander had already began the era of connoisseurship.  Most men,  says Arcesilas, a philosopher of that day, quoted by of Plutarch, "think it an indispensable requisite to and inquire closely into the composition and value of works of art, which are quite foreign to them, such as pictures and statues, and to contemplate pared,them carefully both with their eyes and mind, while they neglect their own life, which offers to them a fruitful subject of meditation.  With among Alexander too began that splendid royal patronage through which art was made chiefly subservient to the glory of the individual, and thus determined to the production of portrait and of historical monuments. The Phidias of this new era in art was Lysippus, but his skill in portrait formed only one direction of his genius. He is supposed to have completed the Hercules ideal, both as resting momentarily from his labours, as with in the Farnese Hercules, or as reposing for ever from his toils at the table of the gods, according to the conception indicated by the Torso of the Vatican, which, if legend may be trusted, was found by Michael Angelo in the workshop of a shoemaker who used it as a block on which to cut out his last!Lysippus was also famous as a sculptor of animals: Petronius says of him, that he  lent speech to the souls of animals through the forms he gave to their bodies.  He was especially great in horses, so that we may with some probability take the Horses of the Sun at Venice as an indication of his power in this way. The wanderings of these famous horses are curiously indicative of European political vicisstudes. Originally produced by a Greek artist as an offering to some temple of Apollo, they were first carried from Greece to Rome; then from Rome to Constantinople; from thence, on the conquest of the city by the Latins, they were carried as a trophy to Venice; five hundred years later they were transported by Napoleon to Paris, where they adorned the triumphal arch of the Tuileries until, after Napoleon s fall, they were restored to Venice. A favourite occupation of art under the successors of Alexander was the symbolical representation of countries, cities, nations, and rivers as human individuals. The ideals of the gods were exhausted; hence the artists were urged to seek new subjects for ideal forms, and they found them in this kind of personification. Such productions formed suitable ornaments for the triumphal processions of the royal personages whose courts now became the centres of Greek art, while the ancient schools of Greece sank into insignificance.</p><p>"Athens, Sicyon, and Argos,  says Professor Stahr, "almost vanished out of the history of art; and although the traditional forms of art were still practised, and in Athens especially, the important commissions given by the kings of Egypt, Syria, and Pergamos, gave very various employment to artists, there had nevertheless begun a time in which neither the illustrious artists nor the great works produced by them exercised a substantial influence on the further development of plastic art. This is the period which Pliny marks out as lying between the years 290 and 152 before Christ. At its close commences the revival of genuine Greek art in Athens, coinciding with the epoch at which it at tained predominance in Rome. Shortly before the beginning of this period, in the time of Alexander the Great, we see the historical study of earlier art beginning to exhibit itself in a literary form. Books of travel appeared containing descriptions of cities and countries which were peculiarly rich in works of art. Lists were made of the most celebrated works of art, the merits of great artists were compared, and particular species of art were criticised in systematic and historical works. And, for the most part, it was not laymen, but artists, and among them masters of reputation, who in this way sought to exercise an influence on the taste and judgment of their contemporaries, as well as on the practice of art. In consequence of this, the earlier creative spontaneity of the artist gave way more and more to conscious reflection and calculated purpose. By the great political revolution which had taken place, Art was removed further and further from its position as a necessary member of a political and religious organism; its connexion with the common national life as developed in the organic communities of the various races and republics of Greece being dissolved, it became with poetry and literature, principally the affair of the rich and cultivated.</p><p>After Alexander s death, Rhodes and the Greek cities of Asia Minor rose into celebrity as centres of art. To the school of Rhodes we are indebted for the Laocoon, the date of which has been so hotly disputed by the critics. Stahr adopts the opinion that refers it to the period of the early emperors. The school of Pergamos contributed the Dying Gladiator, Byron s description of which makes those who are more imaginative than critical unwilling to adopt the interpretation now sanctioned by the best critics, namely, that it does not represent a gladiator, but is a figure once forming part of a group of barbarians intended to celebrate the triumph of Attalus, king of Pergamos, over the Gauls who infested the Macedonian states after the death of Alexander, and that it was transported to Rome at the time of the Roman conquest of Pergamos. These statues of barbarians mark an interesting change in Greek art. We see by the OEginetan sculptures that early art, as might be expected, attempted no distinction of race other wise than by costume. The Trojans resemble the Greeks to a hair in all but their armour. Of course it was the same in early painting. When Polygnotus had to paint at Delphos the Ethiopian king, Memnon, he did not give him the form and complexion of an Ethiopian, but symbolized his nationality by the embroidery of </p><p>dress, and by placing Moorish boy at his feet. </p><p>"First with Alexander the Great, who by his world-conquering expeditions opened to the Greeks a close </p><p>acquaintance with numerous foreign nations, began also to arise in art the sense for historical representation in the characteristic style. Hence followed radical revolution in plastic art. A totally new study of nature was necessary to the artist, and the hitherto exclusive regard to beauty of form necessarily gave way to the striving after characterization. The artists who received the commission to commemorate the victory of Attalus over the Gauls, had to perform their task in the presence of actual reality. These savage Gauls were well-known figures; hundreds of thousands had beheld them with terror. The artist who should represent them was thus not in the position of the OEginetan sculptor, from whom the barbaric Trojans, represented by him after the Homeric legend, were removed by man hundred years. Artists like Pyromachus and his colleagues must undertake an individual representation of a national type, if they would be understood by their contemporaries. They must study the Gallic type in real models--which could not be wanting--in order to represent it so as to meet the requirements of their age. And this they did, as we see by their works; but they have also ennobled this barbaric type, and made it beautiful in its kind. </p><p>We have next a sketch of Etruscan art, and the Roman art that grew out of it in the early times of the Republic, of which we have perhaps a characteristic relic in the She-Wolf of the Capitol. This prepares the way for an account of that restoration of Greek art alluded to in a previous quotation as having commenced, after a century and a half of enfeeblement, in the second century before Christ, that is, after the close of the second Punic War, when the Romans began to cultivate art as an exotic. The school of Athens began to revive, and found market for its productions in Rome; Greek artists began to take up their residence in the world metropolis; in fact, Rome began to bear some thing of the same relation to Greek art that Lon don bears to Italian music. The conquest of Greece, and the transportation of its art-treasures to Rome, heightened the appetite for such things as objects of luxury and dilettantism, and significant trait, that the Romans in this period originated that application of the word  taste  to art, which rouses Mr. Ruskin s indignation. Professor Stahr illustrates the Roman point of view on this subject in an interesting chapter on "Cicero and his Relation to Art,  and in short discussion of the Roman art-robberies, which he traces from their germ in the religious belief that to deprive state of its divine images was to deprive it of the aid of its gods, he indicates the advantages we have derived from this felony on a large scale, which,</p><p>like so many other misdemeanours, we at once denounce and practise. In fact, but for Roman plunder and Roman patronage we should have known little of Greek art; for in spite of the terrible conflagrations which have again and again laid the greater part of Rome in ruins, those ruins have proved our best storehouse; they have preserved to us precious copies, while the ruins of Greece have yielded few originals. </p><p>The remainder of the volume is occupied with the history of art under the emperors, from Augustus to Hadrian. The conception of Bacchus as the Care-Dispeller was a favourite one with the artists of this period, and among the statues which were inspired by this ideal is the wonderful Barberini Faun, who is sleeping off the influence of the god. </p><p>It was found in the moat of the Castle of St. Angelo, from the battlements of which was thrown down by the garrison, in the time of Belisarius, on the heads </p><p>	VOL. LXV. 		23</p><p>of the besieging Goths! To the early part of this period belongs, in all probability, the Apollo Belvedere, which was found in Raphael s time among the ruins of the summer-palace of Antium, a favourite residence of the early emperors, especially of Nero. The relation which later works of supreme excellence, like this Apollo, have to the ideals of the earlier Greek artists, may suggest an interesting comparison with certain recent accusations of plagiarism directed against Longfellow. </p><p>"The artists who flourished on ltalian ground in the period of the restoration of Greek art, could hope to place themselves on a level with their great predecessors only by endeavouring to complete and ennoble the characteristic types and </p><p>ideal forms of the Gods created by the old masters. In this position, at once of freedom and subordination, which renounced the dangerous glory of novel invention, lay, as the great Visconti remarks, one of the secrets which secured the success of later art. Thus Praxiteles  Venus of Cnidos grew into the Venus de Medici of Cleomenes, and the Hercules-ideal of Lysippus into the Farnese Hercules of Glycon. Thus artists of whom history has not preserved to us as much as their names, because they lived later than those Greek writers on art from whom Pliny drew his information, left behind works like the Torso and the Barberini Faun, like the Colossi of Monte Cavallo, and the Antinous Braschi, like the Nile and the Tiber-- Masterpieces which induce us to believe that the artists whose chisel created them have surpassed the old masters. For they did not shrink from being imitators, only their imitations cast the old originals into the shade.  -Visconti, OEuvres divers.</p><p>Under the magnificent patronage of Hadrian, art rallied before its final death-struggle, and bequeathed to us the melancholy beauty of the Antinous. The group of San Ildefonso, which Lessing interpreted as Sleep and Death, is now explained, by the troublesome acumen of many critics, to represent Antinous being led by the Genius of Hadrian to the realm of shades. The second brief division of the volume is occupied with an account of the portraits of the Roman emperors and their families, which are preserved to us among the relics of ancient sculpture, and with considerations on the colossal in plastic art.</p><p>Professor Stahr, as we have intimated, aims rather at making his subject agreeable, and at giving general conceptions, than at furnishing detailed and systematic information; and besides he treats almost exclusively of sculpture, his title, which implies that he treats of ancient art generally, being too comprehensive. On closing his book, the reader, who was not well instructed beforehand will probably want to know precisely what may be learned from the remains of ancient literature concerning Greek artists and their works. He will be glad of dates and precise bibliographical references, and will welcome a writer whose object is matter and not manner. Such a reader will find what he wants in Brunn s valuable and elaborate history of the Greek Artists.  The work isnot yet complete,volume having recently</p><p>----- </p><p> "Geschichte der Griechischer K nstler.  Von Dr. Heinrich Brunn.</p><p>appeared; but in this part there is a complete account of the painters and architects. </p><p>Something equally comprehensive in relation to modern art, at least in one department, is promised by the title,  History of the Painters of all Nations,"4 given to a handsomely printed and profusely illustrated quarto volume, which presents the incongruous features of having the names of a French author, a French artist, and an American publisher, on its title-page, and a preface by Mr. Digby Wyatt, congratulating the publisher on preparing so important a work for the English public. But this promise of comprehensiveness is not fulfilled, for the volume contains the lives of a few painters only, belonging to the German, Dutch, Spanish, and French schools. Some of the lives are well written, the illustrations varying in value, from the respectable to the worthless-from the tolerably fresh to the quite worn-out stock engraving; indeed, the book seems to have been constructed on the same principle of using up fragments, as the housewife s economical pie.</p><p>We turn from the art which most of us must leave our homes to get even a glimpse of, to that which has at least the advantage of visiting us at our own firesides--the art of the romancer and the novelist; and the first work of fiction that presents itself as worth notice is the "Shaving of Shagpat,"5 an admirable imitation of Oriental tale-telling, which has given us far more pleasure than we remember to have had even in younger days from reading "Vathek--the object of Byron s enthusiastic praise. Of course, the great mass of fictions are imitations more or less slavish and mechanical--imitations of Scott, of Balzac, of Dickens, of Currer Bell, and the rest of the real makers;  every great master has his school of followers, from the kindred genius down to the feeble copyist. The  Shaving of Shagpat  is distinguished from the common run of fictions, not in being an imitation, but in the fact that its model has been chosen from no incidental prompting, from no wish to suit the popular mood, but from genuine love and mental affinity. Perhaps we ought to say that it is less an imitation of the "Arabian Nights  than a similar creation inspired by a thorough and admiring study. No doubt, if a critical lens were to be applied, there would be found plenty of indications that the writer was born in Western Europe, and in the nineteenth century, and that his Oriental imagery is got by hearsay; but to people more bent on enjoying what they read than on proving their acumen, the  Shaving of Shagpat  will be the thousand and second night which they perhaps longed for in their childhood. The author is alive to every element in his models: he reproduces their humour and practical sense as well as their wild imaginativeness. Shibli Bagarag, the barber, carries a great destiny within him: he is to shave Shagpat the clothier, and thus to become Master of the Event. The city of Shagpat, unlike the city</p><p>----- </p><p>4 The History of the Painters of all Nations.  By M. Charles Blanc. New York: Montgomery.</p><p>5 The Shaving of Shagpat.

Moreover, among the myriad hairs of Shagpat is the mysterious "Identical," which somehow holds the superstition of men in bondage, so that they bow to without knowing why--the most obstinate of all bowing, as we are aware. Hence he who will shave Shagpat, and deliver men from worshipping his hairy mightiness, will deserve to be called Master of the Event; and the story of all the adventures through which Shibli Bagarag went before he achieved this great work--the thwackings he endured, the wondrous scenes he beheld, and the dangers he braved to possess himself of the magic horse Garaveen, the Lily of the Enchanted Lea, and other indispensable things, with his hair-breadth escapes from spiteful genii--all this forms the main action of the book. Other tales are introduced, serving as pleasant landing-places on the way. The best of the story of Khipil the Builder, humorous apologue, which will please readers who are unable to enjoy the milder imaginativeness of Oriental fictions; but lovers of the poetical will prefer the story of Bhanavar the Beautiful. We confess felt rather having languishing interest towards the end of the work; the details of the action became too complicated, and our imagination was rather wearied in following them. But where is the writer whose wing is as strong at the end of his flight as at the beginning? Even Shakspeare flags under the artificial necessities of a d nouement.</p><p>But perhaps, reader, you are too severely rational to revel in the fantastic impossibilities of an Arabian Entertainment; you have no sympathy with the grotesque ideal?" In that case you will find something more to your taste in the ingeniously conceived possibilities of Mr. Wilkie Collins s "After Dark,"6 two volumes of tales, all, except one, previously published in Household Words,  but now for the first time cleverly put into heightens their effect. This setting is an episode in the life of a travelling portrait-painter, which we are made to learn through the charmingly simple narrative of his wife s diary. Disabled for a time by weakness of the eyes from working at his profession, his wife suggests that he should fill up the consequent deficit in their purse by dictating to her "after dark,  when her household work ks done, some of the good stories he has gathered in the course of his wanderings. The well-known necessity for getting a  sitter  to talk of something that will interest him and make him forget that he has to look dignified, renders the portrait painter ingenious in extracting personal anecdotes and bits of striking expe-</p><p>----- </p><p>6"After Dark."

In the prologue to each of his stories our painter, in  After Dark,  gives us something of what he has gathered from the former source; he describes one of his sitters or the persons with whom a certain commission brought him into contact, dud tells us the conversation that led to his eliciting the succeeding story. These prologues are carefully and agreeably written, and have the negative charm, in these days of spasmodic writing fast rising into the importance of a positive merit  of being free from all affectation. Of the tales themselves, the main element is the excitement either of curiosity or of terror; their great merit consists either in the effective presentation of a mystery or the effective working up of striking situations; their chief defect in the neglect of character and detail. The writer does not care to interest us in his personages, but only in what happens to them. Since Mrs. Crowe has ceased to write, Mr. Wilkie Collins seems to be without a rival in the skilful movement of a ghost or murder story, and he knows how to give the thrill of  terror, without mingling that sort of offence to refined sensibilities which causes terror to pass into horror and disgust. Three admirable stories of this class are, "The terribly strange Bed,  "Gabriel s Wedding,  and  The Yellow Mask,  and we commend them as short, strong draughts to any one who has been nauseated by the copious drawing-room slip-slop of three novels like "Laura Gay,  or "Olive Hastings." The author of "After Dark,  seeks his moving incidents in modern life, and he usually, in the end, interprets the supernatural into the natural. In these excessively knowing days a mystery has become simply a problem, a murder simply an occasion for exercising the ingenuity of the detective police; instead of turning pale at a ghost, we knit our brows and construct hypotheses count for it; instead of shuddering at a murder, we throw an amateur zeal into the investigation of the evidence. Edgar Poe s tales were an effort of genius to reconcile the two tendencies--to appal the imagination and yet satisfy the intellect and Mr. Wilkie Collins, in this respect, often follows in Poe s track, though, to our thinking, he succeeds best when he pays no tribute to rationalism, but gives the rein to his faculty for what the Germans call the schauderhaft, which means, in general, whatever makes one s flesh creep. There are still plenty of readers left who abhor the explanatory, and doat on what can never be accounted for. To such readers we recommend "La Main Enchant e,  an eerie story (scene, Paris, time, the reign of Henry the Fourth), by poor G rard de Nerval. It forms only a small part of volume recently published under the title of  La Boh me Galante, 7 a medley of literary sketches, poems, tales, and dramatic criticisms. There is one other story in the volume, "Le Monstre</p><p>----- </p><p>7"La Boh me Galante.  Par G rard de Nerval.

It seems to speak well for the virtue of the Tyrolese, that Satan cuts an extremely poor figure in their Saga--that he seems indeed to have the reputation of being somewhat of a blockhead, the popular mind of Tyrol thus jumping with the conclusion of sage philosophers, that in fact supreme stupidity. For example: on that famous rock, the Martinswand, the devil, not discouraged by his failure in tempting the Emperor Maximilian, continued the same malevolent game with less important personages, such as poor peasants who had no money to pay their taxes, herdsmen who had lost their cattle, or unsuccessful hunters longing for a charmed bullet, </p><p>till at last a bold and cunning goatherd spoiled his business for ever. As this brave youngster was one day watching his goats, he was hardy enough to vary his amusement of waking the echoes by challenging Beelzebub, who lost no time in showing his unamiable form from behind a block of granite. "Here am I,  he howled, in a voice like the roaring of the wind;  three things you may demand of me, for each of which you must pay me with your soul; only in case cannot perform any one of the three are you at liberty again.  The goatherd collected his spirits, which had been little scattered by the unexpected answer to his challenge, and, after moment s thought, proposed that Beelzebub should gather and bring to him, in a quarter of an hour, all the primroses on the mountain; not one must be missing. At the end of the time the devil came back, perspiring and panting, with huge basket of primroses on his back, and shook the flowers down at the goatherd s feet.  Is there not one missing?  said the youngster. "Not one,  said the devil. Then the goatherd turned up his hat and laughingly showed a bunch of primroses which he had gathered that morning! The devil had lost, and must try again. The next task was to milk all his challenger s goats in a quarter of an hour. Away he went, and succeeded to admiration till he came to the last goat, which proved more than his match, and upset him again and again, so that his cloven hoof flew up in the air like a pony s when he rolls himself on a summer s day. At last, spent and out of breath, the devil gave up, and confessed that he had lost again. "I can well believe it,  said the goatherd, shaking his sides with laughter, "when you set about milking the he-goat, you were not likely to have done your work in a hurry." The third task was to count all the crucifixes in Tyrol are known to be innumerable, and after loading his back with memoranda of numbers, the devil had to confess himself once more outdone. Since this notable snubbing, he has been so mortified that he has not shown himself in that region again.</p><p>We are always ready to listen to the Germans </p><p>----- </p><p>8"Sagenkr nzlein aus Tirol."

What shall we say then to a German who offers us  Pictures from the War in the East; a series of historical romances out of our own times,"9 who overlays the stirring truth of last year s journals with dull fiction who thinks he can improve on the natural granite by daubing it with his stucco.

The tale we mean is called  Ernestine, ou la Naissance de l Amour;  it is no more than thirty pages long, but in that short space, and at the expense of only half an hour s reading, we have the story of naive girlish passion, given with far more finish, that is, with more significant detail, than most of our writers can achieve by the elaboration of three volumes. As a whole, however, this book on love would incline a reader not otherwise acquainted with the author, to think that estimate of De Stendhal (or Beyle) now current, is</p><p>somewhat due to the reactionary tendency of fashion. The form of the book is repulsive; it is, in fact, a collection of notes, written down in various moods, from the cynical to the sentimental; and the opening, which to the sentimental; professedly exhaustive analysis of love, happens to be one of the weakest parts of the collection. But renouncing a continuous reading of what has no proper continuity, and dipping in here and there, one alights on fragments of excellent sense and caustic observation. A good deal of the causticity is applied to the foibles of women, but some of them, probably, will think Beyle makes amends for a few Rochefoucauldisms on this subject, by his pithy arguments in favour of giving women a thorough education.

In the meantime, he advises a woman to write on two conditions only: that she contributes to maintain her family by it, or that she keeps the fact a secret even from her friends--conditions, which we</p><p>fancy, would considerably thin the ranks of the authoresses; perhaps not without compensating advantages to the world. Since, however, in spite of all discouragements, from the days of Faust until now, the number of silly men who rush into print has been constantly on the increase, we see no reason to think that silly women will follow a different law. </p><p>The most strenuous opponent of feminine authorship will scarcely deny that women have certain opportunities and qualifications which, if their culture were more comprehensive, might fit them for writing excellent children s books, and so multiply such treasures as the Little Merchants,  or the "Croften Boys.  Fortunately, in the absence of more Miss Edgeworths and Harriet Martineaus, there is every now and then a man of genius, who is also a happy father, and thinks it worth while to write delightful stories for boys and girls, as well as for men and women. Mr. Kingsley, for example, who has lately followed up his "Westward Ho!" by "The Heroes; or, Greek Fairy Tales for my Children."  The "Heroes  he has chosen are Perseus, the Argonauts, and Theseus; and he tells about them so charmingly, that we have read his tales from beginning to end almost as eagerly as they can have been read by the "Rose, Maurice, and Mary,  for whom they were expressly written.</p><p>What Mr. Kingsley wishes to do for his children, namely, to help them to  love and understand those old Greeks who have so strangely left their mark behind them on this modern world on which we live.

Cam bridge: Macmillan and Co.</p><p> The Iliad of Homer,  faithfully Translated</p><p>admit that, in spite of Chapman, Pope, Southey, and Cowper, Homer yet waits for a translator the who shall be to the English mind what Voss is to the German. Voss, we think, solved the translator s problem: he produced a version of Homer which was simple, faithful, and yet satisfactory to the ear; but he had the advantage of writing in a language which lends itself with facility to hexameters. By what method, in the without absence of this advantage, Professor Newman has endeavoured to solve this problem, he explains to us in his preface:-- </p><p> The first matter of all, is, to select the metre; with which the style is intimately connected. The moral qualities of Homer s style being like to those of the English ballad, we need a metre of the same genius. It must be fundamentally musical and</p><p>popular. Only those metres which, by the very possession of these qualities, are liable to degenerate into doggerel, are suitable to reproduce the ancient Epic. To say this, is to say, that our metre of must be composed of systems of either four or three beats; for it is of such lines that English ballads or ditties are composed. Indeed, musicians tell us that all simple melodies are formed in eight bars,--even what is called 'the subject  in the most complicated pieces of Mozart or Beethoven. I imagine that the Long Metre  of our Hymn Books,--(the metre of Walter Scott, by far the most Homeric of our poets,)--is in fact founded on this musical principle; while our 'Common Metre  is the same, with merely a 'rest  at the end. How naturally one generates the other, is seen in Scott s own practice, who intermingles lines of three beats as sort of close to those of four. The same thing appears in Greek anapsests, which closewith a 'paroemiac' verse. Indeed the Homeric line itself is composed of two shorter lines, with three beats in each, and is undoubtledly founded on ditty  or sing-song, like our own ballad.</p><p>	*	*	*	*	*</p><p> These considerations convinced me  priori that the English metre fitted to translate Homer's hexameter must be long line composed of two short ones, having each either three beats or four beats. The nature of our syntax, which habitually begins sentences with unaccented words, (such as And, Or,</p><p>	"When severaly thus were they</p><p>	The Troian ranks, like flocks of fowl,</p><p>	As verily the scream of cranes</p><p>	Who, scar d by storm ineffable,</p><p>	Soar on the pinion clamouring</p><p>	Unto the men of Pygmy breed</p><p>	And at the early morning, set</p><p>	But you Achaians, breathing might,</p><p>	Each for his comrade resolute</p><p>		  And, as along a mountain s tops,</p><p>	To shepherds hateful, but to thief</p><p>	And so far as one casts a stone,</p><p>	So then the dust wave wreath d in storm</p><p>	As on they went: and speedily</p><p>What admirable energy and perseverance it must require to produce translation of the "Iliad,  in the midst of other important avocations, may be inferred from Porson s declaration that literal prose translation of Homer.

It </p><p>remained to inquire what should be its compass; and a series of trials showed, that it was best to compose the line of four beats added to three. Many passages of Homer can be got into an  Alexandrine,  that is, into three and three; but I found that, first, this could not be</p><p>kept up systematically, without becoming too terse, whereas the genius of Homer is to be loose and expansive: secondly, my metre could not be right unless it would render also the polished hexameter of epigrams and epitaphs; but while 'four and three' had compass enough for this, the 'three and three' often failed entirely; next, I found that many even of the Homeric lines by no compression could be brought into the Alexandrine, and that beauty and effect was sometimes largely lost if it was impossible to made to render line by line; lastly, no longer trial made it certain to me that the monotony of the Alexandrina is unendurable in a long poem, since the first part of the line has no facility of various sub-division. Such were the general arguments which forced me to believe four beats and three beats to give the elementary solution of my problem. </p><p>'But, besides this, I held it as an axiom that </p><p>this, rhyme must be abandoned. Even to Chapman, with his Homeric genius, and a metre fundamentally good, it was impossible to let the Englishman know what Homer had said, and not obtrude on him what was Chapman's own: for the exigencies of rhyme positively forbid faithfulness. Yet on abandoning rhyme, to which our ears are accustomed in the popular ballad, I found an unpleasant void, until </p><p>I gave a double ending to the verse, i.e., one (unaccented) syllable more than our Common Metre allows. Having attained this result by an exhaustive process of argument and experiment, I found with pleasure that I had exactly alighted on the metre which the modern Greeks adopt for the Homeric hexameter, ever since they have aban doned the musical principle of quantity (or Time) as determining metre, and have betaken themselves to accent.  </p><p>To illustrate this explanation we give the opening of the third book:-- </p><p>	beneath their leaders marshall d,</p><p>	mov d on with noise and clatter;</p><p>	across the sky is carried.</p><p>	and by the scowl of winter,</p><p>	towards the streams of Ocean,</p><p>	murder and ruin bearing,</p><p>	dire controversy forward.</p><p>	march d all of them in silence,</p><p>	some feat of arms to venture.</p><p>	mist from the South wind gathers,</p><p>	than shades of night more friendly,</p><p>	may each man see before him;</p><p>	was raised beneath their tramping,</p><p>	the breadth of plain trav rs'd they.  </p><p>recorded of the scholarly Trinculo, in the "Porsoniana  appended to that pleasant book, Roger s Table Talk,  on which, however, we do not mean to dwell, because conversation and the newspapers have already given wings to its good</p><p>stories, and made them familiar even to those </p><p>----- </p><p> Recollections of the Table Talk of Samuel Rogers," to which is added Porsoniana.

We choose rather to direct the attention of our readers--at least of such as are fond of gardening--to a work which they are less likely to hear of from other sources. It is a volume which comes to us from Calcutta, and is full of agreeable gossip and tasteful citation on  Flowers and Flower-gardens,  4 by Mr. D. L. Richardson, a writer favourably known to the English public, or rather to a certain public in England, by his  Literary Leaves.  He wishes to stimulate the love of gardening not only among the English in India, but among the wealthy natives, in the hope that so civilizing a taste may spread downwards to the poorer classes, and of course his book is accommodated to the meridian under which he writes. But people in England who care for what we may call garden-literature, will find a great deal to interest them in these results of Mr. Richardson s studies and experience. They will find the matter very various--poetical quotations, legends, facts of natural history, anecdotes, horticultural rules,and horticultural gossip. One bit of the gossip, namely, that Mr. Bohn is not only the most prolific of publishers, but the most comprehensive of rose-fanciers in England, reminds us that we have to mention a pile of additions to his useful, if not always unexceptionable,  Libraries.  The translation of Quintilian 5 by the Rev. J. S. Watson, seems to be very well done, and is one of the most valuable volumes in the  Classical Library,  because Quintilian must arrest an intelligent reader quite apart from any curiosity about him as a classic. We can hardly say as much for Callimachus and Theognis, who, with Hesiod, are presented both in prose and rhythmic versions in another volume of the same series. 6 The list of the  British Classics  is swelled by two more volumes of Burke, 7 and two more of Addison, 8 the works of each being now complete, in six volumes. In company with serial publications we may mention the "Noctes Ambrosianae,  which have reached their third volume. ? This contains some rather better comparative criticism of Milton and Wordsworth, than that in the first volume, where Christopher North characteristically settles their respective merits by saying that  Milton was precisely the opposite of Wordsworth; he was a bad man and a good poet.  This judgment, which is almost worthy to descend to posterity in company with the famous. "This will never do!  of Jeffrey, was afterwards atoned for by a high admiration and a judicious estimate of Wordsworth; and this is the stage of opinion represented in the third volume of the "Noctes.

All inferior poetry is an injury to the good, in asmuch as it takes away the freshness of rhymes, blunders upon and gives a wretched commonality to good thoughts; and, in general, adds to the weight of human weariness in a most awful and culpable manner.  So says Mr. Ruskin, and we thank him for lending his voice to a protest of which there is every day more urgent need. Formerly we used to hear that the unsaleability of bad poems imposed a wholesome check on their publication; but it is clear now, from the constantly increasing supply that there is a demand somewhere--that beneath the active imbecility of those who write feeble poetry there is a lower deep--namely, the passive imbecility of those who read it. Some one has suggested that the bad poets buy and read each other, and thus form a sort of corporation which threatens to outvote the good sense and good taste of society, and set up balderdash as the ideal of literature. It is easy to see how such a corporation may become a terrible majority. Almost all men who have any literary talent or ambition write verses before they are twenty; they disdain any but the highest prizes, and will try for nothing short of epic or dramatic fame. Those who do not begin their career in this way are rare exceptions, and for the most part men of rare, because thoroughly determinate, faculty. But after twenty, the literary aspirants branch off into three distinct classes: first, the true poets, who witch the world with noble song; secondly, the men of real ability, who have early discovered that they are not poets, and in whom some other power than that of versifying has begun to assert itself; thirdly, the men who have too little intellect and too much vanity to know that their poems are bad, and who have no faculty strong enough to constitute a true vocation, which may divert them from their false vocation of poetizing. Some of this class, however, if we may believe their prefaces, are aware that the quality of their poems is not high, but they entertain the opinion that feeble verses are acceptable and edifying to mankind; they presume that people will choose to nourish themselves with the crude and insipid fruit of a currant bush, when the rich clusters of the vine are at their elbow. For example, Mr. Thomas Leigh presents the public with  Garlands of Verse,  chiefly suggested by themes not quite untouched by the great poets-- the Alps,  "Lake Leman,  Moonlight,  "the Nightingale,  &amp;c.--and on the first page he very correctly characterizes his garlands thus:--</p><p>	  Yet ah! my touch is rude;</p><p>	I mar the buds I gather; they lose youth:</p><p>	A sickliness doth on their grace intrude,</p><p>	And dim the freshness of their living truth.</p><p> "Garlands of Verse.  By Thomas Leigh. London: Smith and Elder.</p><p>	  Still such an impulse bids</p><p>	That I must try, nor may my labour leave; 	Though, trust me, with flushed cheek and down drawn lids,</p><p>	I offer even friends the flowers I weave.</p><p>Here plain people must ask what is the impulse which irresistibly drove Mr. Leigh--with this very low opinion of his verses, and in the very painful state of embarrassment concerning them which he describes--to carry his manuscripts to a publisher, to go through the very cooling process of correcting the sheets, to choose a binding for them, and invite the attention of the public to them by advertisement? A man who knows that he sings badly may indeed have a musical impulse to sing in private, but such an  impulse  would hardly drive him to undertake a solo part in Exeter Hall. Verse is not like bread, so in dispensable that it must be made of sawdust and chopped thistles if no better material is to be had. And besides, to borrow Mr. Ruskin s words once more,  there is quite enough of the best--much more than we can ever read or enjoy in the length of a life; and it is a literal wrong or sin in any person to encumber us with inferior work. I have no patience with apologies made by young pseudo-poets,  that they believe there is some good in what they have written: that they hope to do better in time,  &amp;c. Some good! If there is not all good there is no good. If they ever hope to do better, why do they trouble us now? Let them rather courageously burn what they have done, and wait for better days.</p><p>We are inclined to think that Mr. W. R. Cassels is one of those to whom the "better days  are likely to come. His small volume of "Poems,"  is remarkably free from affectation, and there is occasionally a bit of quiet grace or, as in "The Raven,  a pregnant idea not sufficiently worked up, which indicate that a little more patience would have enabled him to produce something that would remain as a distinct possession in the reader s memory. We may be wrong in supposing that Mr. Cassels is a young author, but of Mr. Hamerton, who sends us  The Isles of Loch Awe, and other Poems of my Youth,  we have the authority of his dedicatory sonnet to his guardian for saying, that he has only just attained his majority. This fact of the writer s youthfulness makes the manly, healthy simplicity of his descriptive poetry all the more remarkable. He does not cast about for scenes remote from his experience, but describes the scenes he has lived among, and the unstrained thoughts and feelings they have suggested to him, now and then varying his descriptions with a local legend. Wordsworth seems to be his model, and unlike young imitators generally, he seems to have the most affinity for his model s best characteristics. Mr. Hamerton adds to the accomplishment of verse  that of considerable skill with his pencil, and he illustrates his descriptions by vignettes. There is so much vigour of thought</p><p>----- </p><p> "Poems.  By W. B. Cassels.

London: Painter.</p><p>as well as culture indicated in this early production, that we expect one day to hear of Mr. Hamerton as something far higher than a writer of verse. </p><p>Mr. Ballantyne s "Poems  are principally written in Lowland Scotch; and where this dialect does not become unintelligible to those who "have not the privilege to be born north of the Tweed,  it has somewhat of the elevating effect common to all unfamiliar languages. At least, it is in this way we account to ourselves for the fact that Mr. Ballantyne s Scotch poems are more readable to us than his English ones; when he sings in broad Doric of  The wee raggit Laddie,  there seems to us to be some salt in his verses, but when, like  auld Elspeth,  he takes a higher strain and  gets him to his English,  he is as commonplace and insipid as more southern versifiers.</p><p>Another Scotch poet, far more ambitions in his style, and, we believe, already renowned in Scotland, is Mr. Thomas Aird, whose  Poetical Works,  4 forming a thick volume, are now presented in a new edition. Coleridge s sublime  Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni,  was an audacious plagiarism from a German poetess; but Coleridge did his plundering grandly; he was like the white-headed American eagle, which swoops down with force enough to seize the whole prey from his fellow, and soar with it unmutilated in its beak. Now, Mr. Aird and other poets of his quality, merely nibble and pilfer, and then mash up the fragments they have appropriated into an artificial whole. One would have thought that after Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron, writers of verse would not be eager to take Mont Blanc for a subject; but Mr. Aird is nothing daunted by such predecessors, and he gives us ten or twelve quatrains on the "monarch of mountains.  Who does not remember those wonderfully descriptive lines,--</p><p>	"O struggling with the darkness all the night,</p><p>	And visited all night by troops of stars.  </p><p>Mr. Aird nibbles at this, and then produces one of those irritating travesties of a thought or image already presented in perfection by a great poet, which are constantly meeting us in the pages of the  minor minstrels.  </p><p>	  Blanc! shall we say you sun to thee comes down;</p><p>	Or goest thou up to him?  </p><p>But the most ambitious and dauntless of all in our collection of poets is Mr. Reade," 5 who enters into the lists with Milton and Tennyson--sings over again in blank verse the story of  Man in Paradise,  calls his lyrics  Ulysses,  and "Mariana,  and elaborately imitates the obscurer parts of "Locksley Hall.

The result is that, read sonorously and with significant emphasis, his verses may startle the unwarmed ear with the promise of poetry, as the shooting of stones from a cart may sometimes give an absent person the idea that it thunders. We can only afford room for one short specimen of the magniloquent no-meaning which Mr. Reade achieves, but if the reader chooses, he may find plenty more on every page of the volume called  Man in Paradise.  </p><p>	"Then palpably growing on the crisped air,</p><p>	Thrilled the vibration of a coming power,</p><p>	"Unheard, save on the hollow ear of space,</p><p>	And the fine sense of feeling consciousness.  </p><p>We had meant to dwell a little on Mr. Lynch s </p><p>Rivulet,  6 a small volume of religious lyrics, not indeed showing great poetic power, but admirably distinguished from many similar productions by its purity from egoistic feeling, by the lovingness and sincerity of its spirit.

(History of the Church from 1814 to the Present Time.) By Dr. Gieseler. Edited by Dr </p><p>Redepenning. London: Williams and Norgate. </p><p>THE history of the Church, as of every other department of human affairs, is the history of revolutionary movements and of reactions: the tide of opinion and sentiment is never really stationary, though to the unobservant eye it seems to sleep lazily at ebb, and to sustain for a long while the force with which it rushes against the barriers at high water. The reaction towards positive religion and pietism, which followed the revolutionary movement of the eighteenth century, did not begin in 1814, but it reached that point at which its onward movement became palpable. The War of Liberation in Germany had exalted the religious and imaginative tendencies of the nation; enthusiasm was the order of the day: the "Kaltes Verstand"-the cold understanding was shuddered at as an evil principle, and through the haze of fervid emotion, Gott, Konig, and Vaterland were blended together, and shone as a Trinity in Unity. This religious and political reaction was strengthened by its alliance with the Romantic movement in literature and art which began with the nineteenth century. The main feature of this movement was the exaltation of the Mediaeval above the Classic, of art animated by Christian spiritualism above the art animated by Greek humanism. And as mediaeval art was developed in the closest union with Catholicism the Romantic school naturally had little sympathy with the Reformation, which had gone on the principle, so highly lauded by Andrew Fairservice, of "combing off" from the churches the productions of mediaeval art, as unhealthy adjuncts to religious worship. Hence, some of the chief Romanticists, notably Frederic Stolberg and Frederic Schlegel, became converts to Rome, and of course these large fish were not netted without an accompanying haul of small fry. Here we see the religious reaction exbihiting itself in its more imaginative and poetic phase. Its intellectual or ratiocinative phase was seen in the increased fervour and more thorough investigation thrown into the controversy between Rationalism and Supernaturalism in the Protestant Churches, and in the various theories by which it was attempted to place Christianity on a philosophical basis, at the head of which, and in an opposition to each other, stand the systems of Schleiermacher and the Hegelians. To these elements of interest have been added the fermentations within the Catholic Church, dating from the affair of the "Holy Coat"-the struggle between Prussia and Rome on the question of mixed marriages, and the attempt at a Union of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. </p><p>France comes next to Germany in the interest of its Church History during the last half century; but here the drama turns not on the collision between Protestant interpretations or between Catholicism and Protestantism, but on the contest between Catholicism and Infidelity, and on the question of the external constitution of the Church. In the first act of the drama, we see Jesuit missionaries planting huge crosses decked with lilies and little hearts, or frightening untheological laymen on their deathbeds by questions about Jansenius, Quesnel, and the Bull Unigenitus, while Liberalism in the background vents its scorn in a loud "aside." Here are the elements of the the main plot; the secondary plot is the struggle between Ultramontanism and Gallicanism, and we are still far from the catastrophe. </p><p>The religious struggles of Germany and France are typical of those which have been going forward with greater or less vigour in every other country of Western Europe. Everywhere there is the same conflict between Reason and Faith; everywhere the question is-shall the Church govern itself, or shall it be governed by the State? And it is a splendid task to tell the history of this conflict as it has exhibited itself during the last fifty years.</p><p>Something towards this task has been done by Dr. Gieseler in the volume before us; but it is probable that he would have achieved much more if his labours had not been cut short by death. As it is, he has given us no more than a text-book of Church History since 1814; admirable for the ability with which he has digested facts, and the impartiality with which be has presented them, but affording scarcely more than an outline, and in most cases not extending beyond 1848. The volume has been formed from the materials left by him, to which he would, perhaps, have made large additions before publishing them himself. However, most persons who care about Church History, and all who make it a study, will find Dr. Gieseler's volume an acceptable source of information and a valuable book of reference. The section on English affairs is very meagre; but the sketch of religious history in the Papal States, in France, in Catholic Switzerland, and in Germany, is especially well done, and will make an excellent starting-point for further study of the subject. </p><p>The battle between Rationalism and Supernaturalism in Germany is chiefly confined to the clerical and professorial class, and their polemics have little interest even for the educated portion of the people. But, about fifteen years ago, there commenced a movement amongst the Protestants (corresponding to that of the German Catholics under Ronge and Czerski) which has given the controversy a more popular aspect. This is the association of the Lichtfreunde, or Friends of Light, springing from various centres-Magdeburg, Breslau, and Konigsberg, and brought together by the common desire to free Christianity from the fetters of ecclesiastical confessions and dogmas, that its essential principles may have free development in accordance with the wants of the present age. The movement was proximately caused by the indications of an increased tendency in the government, on the accession of the present King of Prussia, to favour the more rigid adherence to dogmatic formulae; but Uhlich, the leader of the party in Magdeburg, seems, like Wesley, to have had in the first instance no desire that his associates should separate from the National Church, but that they should remain in it, in order gradually to effect a reform in spirit and doctrine. The Government, however, frowned on the Lichtfreunde, and the result has been the formation of numerous free churches, in which the bond of faith seems to be of the most elastic kind, being woven apparently out of a mixture of Rationalism and of that Pantheistic interpretation of Christianity which has been promulgated by the younger Hegelians. The following fundamental principles adopted by the Free Church of Nordhausen may be taken as an example:-I. "God is the Father of all, the living God, the eternal Spirit, the sole Lord of the world: His rule is eternally Truth and Love." II. "Jesus is the Christ, the Saviour of Man: his message of reconciliation is Truth and Love." III. "The Spirit is holy in his nature, he fills the Universe, and brings us forth from God at our birth, makes us live through God in our life, and return to God at our death: The blessing wherewith he blesses us is Truth and Love." </p><p>It was to be expected that the ideas and movements of the Lichtfreunde would be saluted by loud denunciations from the orthodox party in the Church. The rigid Lutherans have become more intense and intolerant in their assertion of doctrines since the Government has made the attempt to amalgamate them with the Reformed Church; and orthodox theologians in Germany differ from the same class in England rather in their greater theological culture than in the greater amiability of their spirit. Hence, it is not surprising that before the Lichtfreunde had separated from the national church, they were declared to have forsaken the true Light of the World, and to be no longer brethren in Christ, and that the Evangelische Kirchenzeitung, the organ of Hengstenberg and his party, proclaimed them to be much farther removed from the foundations of true Christianity than the Pope and the Jesuits.</p><p>Such denunciations had their usual effect in heightening the centrifugal force in the dissidents, and the protest of the Lichtfreunde, like other protests, has ended in carrying the Protestants far beyond the limits they at first contemplated. </p><p>THE COURT OF AUSTRIA. </p><p>Memoirs of the Court, Aristocracy, and Diplomacy of Austria.	By Dr. E Vehse.</p><p>Translated from the German by Franz Demmler. In 2 vols.		Longmans.</p><p>Dar. VEHSE's long series of volumes entitled The History of the German Courts since the Reformation, has created a great sensation among two classes in Germany, neither of them, indeed, the most highly intellectual in the nation. One of these is the reading, but not well-red, class, and the other the royal--for in Germany royal families are numerous enough to form a class. No books are more constantly "out" when you ask for them at the circulating libraries in Germany; and almost every division of the series has been in its turn forbidden by the censorship of one or other of the German Courts. In most of the German States, too, the presence of the author was even less tolerated than that of his books, and at last he is expiating a little extra audacity or extra carelessness in relation to the Court of W rtemberg by a six months' imprisonment. </p><p>What, then, is the character of these books which have the double honour of being at once popular and proscribed? Are they attractive to the popular reader because they are written with the fascinating talent of a Macaulay, or dangerous to royalty because they are charged with democratic ideas? Neither the one nor the other. Dr. Vehse's memoirs are simply collections of historical (and sometimes perhaps unhistorical) facts and anecdotes, brought together with considerable industry, but without much art; and, in many cases, being little more than a'patch-work of extracts from a variety of sources, more or less accessible to the common reader. The ostensible reason for their proscription is, that they narrate a few falsehoods; the real reason, probably, is that they narrate a great many inconvenient facts, casting anything but a favourable light on hereditary royalty and aristocracy: this, too, is the reason of their attractiveness for the public. Dr. Vehse's books satisfy curiosity, whereas German histories generally will satisfy nothing but the most philosophic and self-denying search after knowledge. He is neither a philosopher, an historian, nor a good writer; but simply a man who has a taste for historical details, and who has fallen on a vein of inquiry which affords abundant material for popular compilations There is no trace of a peculiar animus against royalty and aristocracy in his books. He merely does not "believe in the great as people believe in ghosts," and he looks on kings, queens, and dukes and duchesses in the same light in which we most of us look at our common fellow-mortals--namely, as objects of unrestrained gossip. It is to Dr. Vehse's credit that, holding this point of view, he has abstained from making his memoirs of courts and aristocracies more of a chronique scandaleuse, and that the worst fault he can be accused of is a too hasty and careless redaction of his materials. </p><p>The Memoirs of the Court of Austria are amongst the most important of Dr. Vehse's series, occupying, in the original, eleven volumes. Having made our acquaintance with them in that original form, we can appreciate the advantage now offered to readers, of an excellent English edition, reduceed, by the omission of uninteresting lists of officials, to the convenient size of two moderate octavo volumes, and in every way made more appetising by its new dress. For, Dr. Vehse is one of those writers who have nothing to lose by translations; and, in the present case, we have a translator who understands his business, and has performed it carefully. In this form, the work is likely to be almost as popular in England as in Germany, for it presents that compromise between amusements and "instruction" so precious to the members of Book Clubs.</p><p>And the history of the Austrian court and aristocracy from the days of the half-wise, half-cracked Max until those of Francis Joseph, is eminently picturesque, and eminently edifying, too, if it be edifying to have abundant demonstration of Oxenstiern's rather musty observation to his son--"See with how little wisdom the world is governed." For, to the list of governors, with little wisdom, the House of Hapsburg can furnish as handsome a contingent as any royal house in Europe: the greater number of its precious scions being, apparently, Nature's experiments in the production of the utmost amount of imbecility with the utmost amount of despotic, self-assertion, and obstinate bigotry. One redeeming point there was in the very worst of them--the love of music and the arts, and the exceptions to the imbecility of the later Hapsburgs--Maria Theresa and her son Joseph--are among the most fascinating characters in history. The grandeur of the Austrian Empire and its importance in the scales of European power, lift the smallest details about the personnel of its court quite above that character of gossip which belongs to some of Dr. Vehse's volumes on the petty courts of Germany. A semi-idiot, who happens to be named of Hapsburg, has a passion for hunting, and the consequence is a series of the most important vicissitudes in the history of Europe. </p><p>One of the most striking facts made evident in Dr. Vehse's volumes is the wholesale apostacy of the Austrian aristocracy. In no country, affected by the Reformation, has "conversion" been so palpably an affair of selfish calculation as in Austria proper. First, the prospect of sharing the Church lands was an irresistible bait held out by Protestantism, and carried over the Austrian aristocracy in shoals. In 1596, says Dr. Vehse, when Ferdinand (afterwards Emperor) celebrated Easter in his capital of Gratz, he was almost the only one who took the sacrament, according to the Romish rite, there being not more than three Papists besides him in the town. In the whole of the arch-duchy of Austria there were, of all the noble houses, only five, in Carinthia seven, and in Styria not more than one that had remained Papists. When the tide turned, after the Thirty Years' War, the re-conversions were equally wholesale. </p><p>One of the most interesting figures in Austrian history is Prince Eugene. Dr. Vehse, in his usual "promiscuous" way, collects abundant traits of the generous hero: - </p><p>Eugene was a small man, not at all handsome. His appearance by no meam belied the country where he had received his education--it was completely that of a Frenchman. His complexion was drunk, but remarkably clear; his face thin, long, and strongly marked by a large prominent nose, with nostrils like those of a horse. He wore his own black hair, with two small stiff curls: between his fiftieth and sixtieth year, when he began to turn grey, he assumed a large flowing wig. The only fine point about his face was his eyes; they were dark and full of animation. His glance electrified his soldiers, and won the hearts of the women. It would, however, have been difficult at first sight to recognise in him the great man; he even looked remarkably silly, had a trick of gazing into the clouds, and, like Frederick II., continually took Spanish snuff from his waistcoat pocket; which suggested to Pope the saying, that Eugene took as many towns as snuff. In his movements he showed an incessant restlessness, yet it was tempered by manly vigour and princely, dignified bearing; and in the intercourse with the world he observed the most measured deportment, and even reserve. His impulses all came from within, and he never allowed them to be overruled by any extraneous cause. At the first meeting he was, in most instances, of chilly coldness, taciturn, and reserved. His temperament was tender and sanguine; and he was full of plans and ideas, which unceasingly occupied his mibd. In the prime of life, he seldom slept more than about three hours. He possessed a remarkable instinct for reading the future. Whilst, in 1708, he was encamped before Lisle, he was, in the afternoon cf the 14th of October, suddenly seized with an irresistible drowsiness. In this sleep he dreamed that he saw his mother dead in the trenches. The struggle to reach her awoke him. He told his dream to his adjutant; and soon afterwards news came from Brussels that, at that same hour, his mother had died there. The courtiers at Vienna used to sneer at these fancies of Eugene. But he had an iron will, and a clear strong head; in fact, an Italian intellect, but a German heart, full of gentleness and sympathy. He was called "the Noble Chevalier;" and chivalrous he was to the heart's core, as a lover, a friend, or an enemy. He was always noble, generous, and forgiving, a foe to all flattery and fawning obsequiousness; and he detested everything like untruth and falseness. He never made a promise which he could not keep. The winner of thirteen great battles, he was adorned by the most unaffected modesty. Moderation and disinterestedneas, at that time the qualities rarest to be met with at Vienna, were prominent features of his character. Never did Eugene show the least jealousy of his great friend Marlborough; not even when the latter, after their joint victory of Hochstadt-Blenheim, received for his reward the Imperial principality of Mindelheim. His honesty commanded the respect of every one. He used to say, "honesty is not an indispensable, but it is the best quality of a true statesman." Villars, when he negotiated with Eugene the Peace of Rastadt, wrote home to the Minister of State, Torcy, "Nothing in my life ever gave me so much trouble as the necessity of not giving offence to the honesty of Eugene; for the character of the prince inspires every one witlt veneration."</p><p>Kaunitz is another character whose points are very well marked by Dr. Vehse:-- </p><p>Kaunitz, who presided over the destinies of Austria, was tall, well made, muscular, of rather a lithe figure; his complexion was milk-white, his hair blonde, his eyes blue, very fine, and although ordinarily of a calm expression, yet now and then flashing with the keen glance of the eagle; his brow was a little arched, his nose aquiline, his chin somewhat prominent, his mouth delicately formed and rather small. Kaunitz used to wear a remarkable tie-wig with a profusion of curls, which, to cover every wrinkle on his forehead, ran  across it in a zigzag line. He seems to have been the inventor of the art of powdering, practised also by the famous Prince de Ligne; who used to walk to and fro through a double line of servants, each of whom had a different shade of hair-powder, white, blue, yellow, and pink, to throw at his wig, which, after this combined operation, exhibited what was considered to be the perfection of evenness and colouring. "From the very beginning of his being in power," Baron Furst writes, "Kaunitz placed himself above the court etiquette. With the Spanish costume he wore white (instead of red) stockings, and made his appearance with a bag to his wig, and with a large muff. Although he had beau told to comply with existing customs, he would not always do so. He was everywhere, except when at court, accompanied by a large bull-dog." ....</p><p>No one has ever understood better thau Kaunitz did, the art of making life pleasant to himself and to others. It must also be said, that no one has ever taken such anxious care of his life as he. Whatever could remind him of dying was to be carefully kept in the background. All the persons usually about him were strictly forbidden to utter in his presence the words "death" and "small pox." He had not himself been afflicted with this disorder; but he had been shocked by it in the case of the Empress. His readers received from him in writing an earnest injunction to eschew the use of these two obnoxious words. The wags would have it that even the "inoculation" of trees was not to be spoken of, because it reminded him of the inoculation of the small-pox. His birthday also was never to be alluded to. When the referendary, Von Binder, for fifty years his friend and confidant, died, Xaverius Raidt, the Prince's reader, expressed himself in this way: "Baron Binder is no longer to be found." The prince, after some moments silence, replied: "Est il mort? Il etoit cependant assez vieux." Binder was one year and a half younger than Kaunitz. To another of his readers, Secretary Harrer, at that time a man of sixty, he once said: "Mais comment est-il possible, que de jeunes gens, comme vous, oublient des choses pareilles?" The news of the death of Frederic the Great reached him in this way:--his reader, with apparent absence of mind, told him that a courier had just arrived from Berlin at the Prussian ambassador's with the notifications of King Frederic William. Kaunitz sat for some time stiff and motionless in his arm-chair, showing no sign of having understood the hint. At last he rose, walked slowly through the room, then sat down and said, raising his arms to heaven, "Alas! when will such a king again ennoble the diadem?" When the Emperor Joseph died, the valet returned to Kaunitz a document, which the Emperor was to have signed, with the words: "The Emperor eigns no more."</p><p>This kind of anecdotic sketching is abundant in the book, and, as it is connected with n continuous survey of the fortunes of the Austrian Empire, renders will be nt once amused, and put in possession of n general conception of Austrian history, which is likely to be acceptable to the great majority. </p><p>WHO WROTE THE WAVERLY NOVELS. </p><p>APRIL 19, 1856.] THE LEADER. 375 </p><p>Literature. </p><p>Critics are not the legislators, but the judges and police of literature. They do not </p><p>make laws-they interpret and try to enforce them. -Edinburgh Review. </p><p>	SHAKSPEARE is the inexhaustible theme of English writers, as GOETHE is of the Germans, and in both cases there is sufficient matter for interminable discussion on what SHAKSPEARE wrote, and what GOETHE meant. The first condition-that of a correct text-is, unhappily, not only impossible in SHAKSPEARE's case, but is not in so absolute and definite a state of impossibility that men are willing to resign themselves to it, and judge the writings only by those general excellences which defective texts fail to disguise. Of CHAUCER, of SPENSER, nay, of SHAKSPEARE's own fellow dramatists, especially BEN JONSON, we have unimpeachable texts. But the greatest poet yet known to the world is known only through a text which is hopelessly corrupt.</p><p>	In the new number of the Edinburgh Review there is an article of unusual excellence on SHAKSPEARE's text, with especial reference to the volume discovered by Mr. COLLIER, containing 20,000 corrections on the margin. We have seen no such writing on that volume as this in the Edinburgh, and commend all our readers to it. The writer very skilfully argues that from the nature of the case these corrections are either all conjectural, and in no wise more authoritative than the conjectures of other critics, or else the corrector must have had some authentic source from which he drew; to admit that some may be authentic is, however, to open the door to endless dispute, since no evidence is ready to distinguish between what is conjectural and what is authentic; and inasmuch as the nature of these corrections for the most part points to an authentic source-in the opinion of the Edinburgh Reinewer-the battle must now shift its ground, and critics must set themselves, if possible, to distinguish between what is conjectural and what authentic.  </p><p>	The same review contains an article on Body and Mind, which will be read with interest, although not in itself remarkable; an able review of BREWSTER's Life of Newton, and an intemperate review of Ruskinism, written probably by some R.A., or by the irate friend of some R.A. That Mr. RUSKIN lays himself open to attack in almost every chapter he writes, no one, now-a-days, need be told: but for an influential journal like the Edinburgh Review to print an article in which the animus is strong but the intelligence feeble, and in which Mr. RUSKIN is proved to be a shallow "prater," whose "jargon" only noodles can admire, is not to affect the reputation of Mr. RUSKIN, but to discredit the Review. The contradictions which are pointed out in this article, at least those that are real, would have served as excellent indications of the caution necessary in reading Mr. RUSKIN, had they been temperately put, and set in tolerable argument; but the writer will find the public slow to believe him against Mr. RUSKIN. What, indeed, can any one think of a critic who retorts on Mr. RUSKIN that "MACLISE is certainly the artist in the whole Royal Academy who has carried to its highest pitch that finish which Mr. RUSKIN admires in the Pre-Raphaelite school!"</p><p>	The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal has nothing in it this quarter which calls for notice here except an angry and supremely foolish review of Professor BADEN POWELL's work, by a Mr. ALEXANDER THOMSON of Banchory, who is afflicted to think that a Clergyman of the Church of England and an Oxford Professor, should hold the "dreary speculations of LAPLACE, LAMARCK, OKEN, and the author of The Vestiges." As a specimen, at once, of Mr. ALEXANDER THOMSON'S logic and charity read</p><p>this:- </p><p>	If Professor Powell's theory of creation be true, and can be proved to be true, then there is an end of all revealed religion, and of all natural religion too,- there cannot be an Almighty personal God creating and sustaining all things. Perhaps the most painful and the most dangerous part of the book to common readers is the mixture of arguments tending to destroy all religion, with professions of respect for Christianity. Surely the author cannot be ignorant of the tendency of his own reasonings.</p><p>	How characteristic this passage is of the amiable and philosophic temper rendering polemics on the Development Hypothesis so agreeable! First, Mr. THOMSON boldly asserts that the theory does away with all revealed religion, and " all natural religion too," as if religion depended on a scientific hypothesis; and, having satisfied his own mind with this logic, Mr. THOMSON straightway accuses Professor POWELL of hypocrisy. How sincerely he himself looks at the question, may be gathered from this:-</p><p>	We admit that we do not find a perfect system of philosophy, either moral or scientific, in the Holy Scriptures. They were given to man for a higher and more important purpose than to teach abstract knowledge. But we do not admit that there is one word or statement in Scripture inconsistent with sound philosophy, or opposed to it; and we go a step further and maintain that the steady progress of Truth in every department,-be it Biblical criticism, mental philosophy, physical science, or antiquarian research,-is rapidly adding to the proofs, already innumerable, that the Bible contains the words, while all nature displays the works, of the Almighty Creator and Preserver of all things, and that His words and His works are ever in perfect harmony-they cannot contradict each other.</p><p>	It is not often we can counsel our readers to read, except for amusement, the criticisms of Frenchmen on SHAKSPEARE; but we counsel them not to pass over M. MONTEGUT's article on Hamlet in the last Revue des Deux Mondes, an article which, in France, will be very striking because it exposes a fallacy running through French art. Indeed this fallacy, although not so widely accepted in England, is also frequently to be met with here. M. MONTEGUT protests against the notion of poetical "types." SHAKSPEARE, as indeed all great poets, does not paint types, he paints individuals. HAMLET is not a type of the metaphysical dreamer. He is an historical individuality-not only complex, because human, but specially complicated with the temporal conditions of his age and rank. There are points in M. MONTEGUT's paper which will be questioned, but the whole cannot be read without interest.</p><p>WHO WROTE THE WAVERLEY NOVELS? </p><p>Who wrote the Waverly Novels? Being an Investigation into certain Mysterious Circumstances attending their Production, and an Inquiry into the Literary Aid which Sir Walter Scott may have received from many Persons. </p><p>London: Smith and Elder. </p><p>	QUEEN ELIZABETH once proposed to have the suspected author of an offensive pamphlet racked in order to extort confession from him. "Nay, Madam," said Bacon, " never rack his person, but rack his style. Command him to write another pamphlet, and I will undertake to pronounce whether he be the author of this." Some persons who are credited with more than their own, are obliging enough voluntarily to place themselves on the critical rack. For example, it was at one time reported that the novels of a very fertile living author were written by his wife; but circumstances at length induced the lady to publish a novel avowedly her own, and that example or her quality as an authoress set the report at rest for ever.</p><p>	Unfortunately, no such test is possible with regard to those for whom W. J. F., the author of the above-named pamphlet, claims the chief authorship of the Waverley Novels. We have no opportunity of racking their style, for their right hand has long forgotten its cunning, and they have left nothing behind them which will enable us to gauge their power. Their works belong to the same famous category with bachelors' wives and old maids' children.</p><p>	We know, indeed, of a brain and hand lying these four-and-twenty years under the sod at Melrose which have left behind them indisputable proof of a genius inspired with all the powers exhibited in the Waverly Novels, of a memory stored with all the knowledge required for writing them, of a nature characterised by all the tastes and idiosyncrasies betrayed in them. That this brain should have produced the Waverly Novels has hitherto seemed no more surprising to the majority of well-informed mankind than that the man who wrote Hamlet should have written As you Like It, than that the conqueror of Jena was the conqueror of Austerlitz, than that the vine which bears purple clusters one year should bear other purple clusters the next. A sufficient cause for the existence of the Waverley Novels seemed to be given in the genius of Scott.</p><p>	But now we are called on to revise this opinion. According to W. J. F., those novels-at least the best of them produced between 1814 and 1823, were not written by Walter Scott, who bas unfairly monopolised the credit of them, but by his brother, Thomas Scott, and Elizabeth MacCulloch, the wife of the said Thomas; the husband contributing the humorous character and dialogue, and the military sketches, and the wife supplying the description of scenery, the feminine characters, and the construction of the plot. The utmost Walter did, it appears, was to throw in some of his dead historical lore among the living scenes that were due to the joint genius of Thomas and Elizabeth, and to add a few limbs and flourishes of style. But the vital part of The Antiquary, Guy Mannering, and the rest was all begotten in Canada, by a man whose hand shook with drink, and a woman who "may possibly" have written some feeble poems and articles signed "Eliza," in the corner of an American newspaper. It was not possible for Walter Scott, a practised writer, to have produced the best of the Waverly Novels in such rapid succession, but it was possible for Elizabeth MacCulloch and her husband. And what is yet more remarkable, the man and woman, who had genius enough to produce works which won not only a world of fame but a world of money, were contented to live an utterly obscure life, and to let nothing but a miserable gleaning of hundreds that you may count by units,</p><p>while their brother pocketed his tens of thousands and carried away immortal fame as the fruit of their labours. Yet more; Thomas and Elizabeth Scott had several children, yet none of those children have, apparently, breathed a word in vindication of their parents' rights.</p><p>	Not a probable case, certainly, considering what we know of human nature. However, le vrai n'est pas toujours le vraisemblable, and we are prepared to bow to sufficient evidence. When W. J. F. has backed his case by adequate proof, we will unlearn half our piety towards Walter Scott, place him in a humble niche of our temple, and make room for W. J. F.'s "strange gods"-Thomas and Elizabeth.</p><p>	At present, however, we are far from feeling coerced by bis evidence, and we have taken up his pamphlet, not as a matter of any importance, hut simply as a literary-or rather, an illiterate-curiosity. From an editorial note in the Irish Quarterly we gather that the initials W. J. F. represent "a gentleman who has obtained a respectable literary status," and having been amused ourselves, we propose to amuse our readers, with the indications afforded in this pamphlet as to the amount of logical ability and literary acquirement with which such a "status" may be obtained.</p><p>	The chief points in W, J. F.'s argument are-1. That an anonymous letter, published in a Quebec newspaper in 1820, states, that the writer saw the manuscript of the Antiquary in Thomas Scott's handwriting, and that Elizabeth Scott "wrote the character of Flora Mac Ivor." 2. That Thomas Scott is pronounced by all who knew him to have possessed great humour and story-telling faculty, and that his wife had a "talent for writing" and was stored with Scotch traditions. 3. That the dates in Lockhart's Life are irreconcileable with the production of the novels by Walter Scott. 4. That among the letters not suppressed by Lockhart there is one written shortly after the appearance of Waverly, in which Walter urges his brother to try</p><p>376 THE LEADER. [No. 317, SATURDAY, </p><p>his hand at a novel and send it him to dress up. 5. That certain scenes and characters in the novels are known to have been familiar to Elizabeth Scott from her childhood. 6. That Walter's denial of the authorship in the first instance nullifies his ultimate assertion of it. </p><p>	A skilful advocate might create an effect with such a brief as this. But W. J . F. so manages his arguments that they either prove too much, or else contradict each other. At one moment he tells us that Walter Scott could not possibly have had time to write the novels; at another, that it is not surprising if the manuscript of most of them is extant in Walter Scott's hand-writing, since he thought nothing of the trouble of copying,-at another, that "an adaptation must take a longer period to accomplish than a story written currente calamo." Again, he brings forward Sophia Scott's declaration, that though the whole family had access to her father's papers, they had never seen a scrap of the manuscript of any of the novels, forgetting that, if, as he says on another page, Walter Scott acted the part of "a skilful editor who fluently fills up and judiciously strikes out," the difficulty of his daughter's statement is rather increased than lessened. His family would be much more likely to notice a strange manuscript on his desk, than to notice his own. But we do not undertake to dissect W. J. P.'s arguments, still less to disprove them. Our readers, we fancy, will thank us more for giving them a few specimens, which, to speak in the style of able editors, "need no comment."</p><p>	Searching for cumulative evidence, W. J. F. procured an old Army List, in which he read the names, first, of the officers in the 70th regiment, of which Thomas Scott was Paymaster, and, subsequently, of the officers in other regiments, engaged in Canada, with which the 70th was brought into frequent intercourse. Hereupon, he tells us, he was struck with "some remarkable coincidences;" and probably the reader will be equally "struck" when he learns what some of these coincidences were. The list of officers in the 70th, he discovers, has a Captain O'Neil-and, in "Guy Mannering" there is a Lieutenant O'Kean; it has a Mac Laurin-and in the Fair Maid of Perth there is a MacLouis; in the Legend of Montrose a Maclean; it has a Gaston-and one o the novels is called Anne of Gierstein! You see at once that these names are as like "as my fingers is to my fingers?" But these astonishing coincidences are nothing to what is coming. There was actually in the 70th a Lieutenant John Graham-and in Old Mortality there is a Colonel John Graham of Claverhouse (of course, an altogether unhistorical personage) ; there was also a Lieutenant Smith, whose name clearly suggested that of Harry Smith, the valiant armourer in the Fair Maid of Perth. After this one does not wonder to find W. J. F. saying-"Some mysterious impulse led me to try whether if (sic) in the Army List of that day any George Heriot would be found (for who ever heard of a George Heriot except in the Fortunes of Nigel)." Startling result! a Colonel F. George Heriot commanded the Canadian Voltiguers. The only real "coincidences" between the list of the 70th and the Waverly novels are the names of Dalgetty and Sampson. Apropos of the former, W. J. F. quotes Dalgetty's reference to "the learning while I had acquired at the Mareschal College of Aberdeen," in order to point out the curious coincidence that "Mareschal," is the name given to one of the characters in the Black Dwarf. Apropos of the latter, he quotes a statement made by an old messmate of Thomas Scott's, that Adjutant Sampson, who was a queer, but honest fellow, had the nick-name of "Dominic," omitting to ascertain whether the nick-name was given before or after the publication of Guy Mannering.</p><p>	But the most astonishing revelations are yet to come. In other regiments W. J. F. detects an Ensign Jones-and there is a Mrs. Jones in St. Ronan's Well-a Lieutenant Fennell-and you remember Fenella; a Quartermaster Gow-who clearly accounts for Neil Gow, the name of the fiddler in St. Ronan's Well, since no one ever heard before of Neil Row, a fiddler; a Lieutenant Duke-and there is "Duke Hildebrod" in Nigel! Last, and most amazing of all, in the 16th there is an officer named Dalzell, and who does not remember General Dalzell in Old Mortality?-in the 97th there is a Captain Monk, and in Woodstock, too, there is-a General Monk!</p><p>	We see what an amount of historical knowledge goes into the attainment of a "respectable literary status."</p><p>	One more taste of W. J. F.'s quality, and we have done. In the 103rd there was a Captain Guy Carleton Colclough, and he sees a casual connexion between this fact and the name Guy Mannering. "For," says W. J. F., "Scott, in his introduction to Guy Mannering, says that he 'looked about for a name and a subject,' and from this observation we infer that such was his invariable habit when commencing a fictitious narrative. The practice is, I believe, usual among authors."</p><p>TYPICAL FORMS. </p><p>Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation. By the Rev. James M'Cosh, LL.D., and George Dickie, M.D. Edinburgh: Constable and Co. </p><p>[SECOND NOTICE.] </p><p>	HAVING in the previous article protested against the argument from design, and against Natural Theology altogether, we will now attempt to convey some idea of the work before us, which is Paley applied to the science of the nineteenth century, taking in quite the latest views of transcendental anatomy.</p><p>	The authors set out with the statement that two great principles are discoverable running through the universe: a principle of Order, or a general Plan, or Type, to which every object is made to conform with more or less precision; and a principle of Adaptation by which each object while constructed after a general model, is at the same time accommodated to the situation which it has to occupy, and a purpose which it is intended to serve. Thus conceived, their work seems one of pure transcendental science; and as such, it might have been of great value; as it is, the illustrations they have brought together of this uniformity and adaptation give it the main interest. Had they not mingled therewith a running thread of Natural Theology they might have produced a work of permanent value; but their theoretical preoccupation has damaged their science.</p><p>	The work consists of three books. The first collects examples of Order prevailing in the world of physics; the second consists of a co-ordinate series of facts giving indications of combined order and adaptation throughout the various kingdoms of Nature-tracing the unity in the forms of plants and animals in geological and astronomical phenomena; the third book is devoted to the interpretation of the facts.</p><p>	Both Dr. M'Cosh and Dr. Dickie have direct scientific knowledge, yet, of course, their book is mainly a compilation, and reads too much like second-hand work. It shows considerable reading, although that reading is not always well digested, nor always so accurately reported as might be. Thus, at page 17, they say "ten is the typical number of the fingers and toes of man, and, indeed, of the digits of all vertebrate animals." They must he perfectly aware that the digits of many vertebrata are eight, six, and even four. Again, at page 23, they say "Animals and vegetables, it is well known, are classified according to type; and they can be so arranged, because types are really found in nature, and are not the mere creation of human reason or fancy." Will they be good enough to say where these types are found, except in the human reason? Do they mean that the typical fish swims amid the myriads of fishes made after his pattern, the typical bivalve gapes amid his gaping satellites, the typical polyp stretches forth its tentacles amid the branches of seaweed? At page 280 we read:-</p><p>	The presence of a system of nerves is the most marked character which separates the animal from the vegetable kingdom. In some of the lower forms, its existence has not been clearly demonstrated; in many it is very rudimentary. But as we rise higher in the scale we find an evident advance, commensurate with the endowments of the animal.</p><p>	The nervous system does not mark the distinction, simply because large classes of unquestionable animals have none. To say that the nervous system has not been "clearly demonstrated," is inaccurate: its existence has nothing but gratuitous supposition by way of evidence in all infusoria, in all the myriad species of Hydrozoa and Anthozoa; and it is now very doubtful whether even the Echinodermata have a nervous system, that which has long been taken for one being questionable.</p><p>	There are other examples which, on a careful revision, they will themselves alter. As a specimen of the elastic nature of their argument to meet any difficulty, take the following:-</p><p>	When the action of the combination of powers necessary to the development of an organ is interfered with we have a Monstor. In monstrosities the principle of order is not accommodated to the usual special end. They are always comparatively few in number-in short, the exception. But we are not to conclude that they are failures, or that they have no end to serve. A world in which they were the rule would certainly be a failure; but, as exceptions, they are as instructive as the rule. They help man to discover the nature of those agencies which combine to form typical organs, and they show bow derangements which, when few, work no evil, would have been fearful if they had been frequent. Teratology, which treats of natural monstrosities, has now a place among acknowledged sciences. Single monsters are produced by arrest of development; double by the union of homologous parts, as of veins to veins, and arteries to arteries. The aberrations of monstrosity do not exceed certain limits. They have their distinctive characters, and long ago there were noticed five orders, twenty-three families and either-three genera. So far as these monstrosities do not produce pain, they are not evils any more than an irregularly-formed crystal is. So far as they are the means of entailing suffering and humiliation among mankind, they carry us into the profoundest of all mysteries (which we cannot here discuss)-the existence of evil.</p><p>	Thus a monster turns out an example of "admirable contrivance;" he is produced in order that man, by noting the exceptions, may understand what is the rule, and may also learn what a fearful world it would have been had the exception been the rule!</p><p>	The tone of their work is commendable. They have none of the acrimony which theologians are prone to substitute for reasoning; and if they are somewhat contemptuous towards adversaries, that is a very general failing. They should not, however, say that the phrase, 'conditions of existence," is the "miserable subterfuge of French materialists." They should not says for two reasons: it was not subterfuge, and it was not invented by the materialists. They ought to know that the phrase is Cuvier's, and that is was very proud of it. Again, why is Buffon's vanity made responsible in the following example?-</p><p>	We are not surprised to find a man so proverbially vain as Buffon failiug to discover marks of design in the hump of the camel, but it is rather wonderful to find Cuvier, whose heart was so filled with admiration of the Divine wisdom, speaking somewhat doubtfully of the sloth.</p><p>Buffon's deliquency is here made moral, Cuvier's only intellectual: is it because these authors can quote Cuvier in favour of final causes, and cannot quote the vain Buffon ? </p><p>	But, as we said, the work contains much that is interesting. The reader will here find brought into brief compass those views of Owen on the vertebral theory, of Huxley on the molluscan archetype, and of Dr. McCosh on vegetable morphology, which Goethe long ago commenced. He will find much with which he will disagree, not a little which will strike him as purely fanciful, but also not a little which will give fresh insight and interest into vegetable and animal forms. As a specimen, we will extract the following:-</p><p>	It will not be reckoned by any scientific botanist, in the preset day, as an excess of refinement to represent the developed organs of the plant as all formed after one or other of two different types or models, the Stem and the Leaf.</p><p>	First, The more solid parts of the plant are composed of a number of stems, proceeding the one from the other in linear succession. Springing from the embryo, or seed, there is the axis mounting upwards and becoming the aerial stem and going downward and becoming the root. From the former of these, or the ascending axis, there go off lateral stems, which we may call branches and from these other stems, which we may call branchlets. There proceed, in like manner, from the descending axis, or top root, lateral branches which also ramify through the soil. There are important differences between the aerial and the subterranean stems to fit them for their different functions. Roots, for example, have no pith, no scales or leaves, and, in ordinary circumstances, no leaf-buds like the upward axis. Still the two arc alike in the general character; the branched plant is found to have a branched root. The tendencies of the underground ramification have not, so far as we know, been carefully determined; but, above ground, it is very evident that the stem branch and branchlet obey the same laws. "If a thousand branches from the same tree," says Lindley, "are compared together, they will he found to be formed upon the same uniform plan, and to accord in every essential particular. Each branch is also, under favour-</p><p>HEINE'S BOOK OF SONGS. </p><p>April 26, 1856.] The Saturday Review. </p><p>523 </p><p>HEINE'S BOOK OF SONGS.* </p><p>HEINE'S Book of Song,, like Tennyson's In Memoriam, draw its inspiration from a single theme. But the Engliah poet, while adhering to the same, poetic form, and revolving round the aame central emotion, takes a wide sweep of thought­-the German poet, on the contrary, keeps within a narrow circle of ideas and feelings, but perpetually varies his poetic form. Unhappy love is the almost unvarying theme of the Book of Songs; but we have read them seriatim, again and again, withont any disagreeable sense of monotony--so ever changing, ever charming, are the melodies of Heine's verse, so inexhaustibly diversified are the modes in which his imagination presents the same feeling. He gives it us in eerie dreams, in ballads, in idyls, in sonnets, and most of all in delicious little lyrics, which he seems to find as easy as sighing; and everywhere there is the same wonderful grace--everywhere there is that completeness of expression without effort, which reminds us of nothing so much</p><p>Heinrich Heine's Book of Songs. A Translation. By John E. Wallis. London: Chapman and Hall. 1856. </p><p>as of the rapid revelations of feeling which may be read in a beautiful and expressive human face. There is no awkward inversion--no far-fetched combination of epithets--no betrayal of art. Song seems as natural to Heine as to the thrush and the nightingale, and, while you are reading him, it is prose that appears artificial. </p><p>Here is the reason why his poems are so difticult to be translated--or rather, so utterly untranslatable by any one who is only a versifier and not a poet. Rhythm and rhyme are no fetters to Heine--they are rather the wings on the sandals of the God, that help him to float through ether with all the more buoyancy. To be simple, idiomatic, and poetic is with him the same thing; but with the generality of translators it is quite another affair. Instead of floating through ether, they toil heavily along the ground. They may make a meritorious effort to be faithful--to say just what Heine says; but there is much the same likeness between their verses and his as between the phrase "I love you," which no one can hear quite unmoved, and the phrase "I feel a tender passion for you," which probably would not greatly move any one; or as between the ever-to-be-quoted lines-- </p><p>	I could not love thee, dear, so well,</p><p>		Loved I not honour more;"­-</p><p>and the never-to-be-quoted paraphrase-- </p><p>	My love would be inferior, dear,</p><p>		Were honour not supreme.</p><p>In translation, something might be done by patient labour towards compensating for the want of the original afflatus; but, unfortunately, translators have usually either too little patience or too low an ideal. They are too easily tired, or too easily satisfied, or they give their patience to the production of quantity rather than quality. A few of Heine's poems finely translated would make the English reader better acquainted with the poet than a feeble English version of the whole. But tho American translator, Mr. Leland, undertakes to translate all the poems as well as all the prose--so that, notwithstanding his ability, he necessarily achieves a much larger amount of failure than of success; and Mr. Wallis now presents us with the whole Book of Songs, when we should probably have been able to thank him much more for a small selection. This might have been one of the cases in which a part is greater than the whole. </p><p>Mr. Wallis writes very modestly in his preface. He has not thrust his translations on the public hastily, but had long with­held them because they fell below his own requirements; and he was only encouraged to publish them at last by the fact that other translations of Heine, perhaps not superior to his own, have been favourably received. He is clearly a very competent German scholar, and his rendering is generally a close one. With some exceptions, he reproduces faithfully the meaning of the original; but, alas! he fails to reproduce their charm. The scent of the violet is gone; the living song has become mechanical verse; and very often the line-for-line rendering only makea the contrast more striking. </p><p>Every reader of Heine remembers the little lyric-­</p><p>	Herz, mein Herz, sei nicht beklommen,</p><p>	Und ertage dein Geschick</p><p>	Neuer Fruhling giebt zurlick,</p><p>	Was der Winter dir genommen.</p><p>	Und wie view ist dir geblieben!</p><p>	Und wie schon is noch die Welt!</p><p>	Und, mein Herz, was dir gerfallt,</p><p>	Alles, Alles dartst du lieben!</p><p>The English reader will understand the charm of thie little lyric, when we tell him that it resembleasthat of Burns's more pathetic songs. The following is Mr. Wallis's version:-­ </p><p>	Heart, my heart, oh, be not troubled!</p><p>		Bear thy lot, though hard it be;</p><p>	Spring will give thee back redoubled</p><p>		All that winter took from thee.</p><p>	Think how lovely is creation!</p><p>		Think what joys await thy call!</p><p>	All things bring thee consolation,</p><p>		Thou art free to love them all!</p><p>This assuredly doea not resemble Burns. "Think how lovely </p><p>is creation!" sounds very much like a quotation from a Unitarian </p><p>Hymn-book. We are amazed that a mind so evidently accomplished as Mr. Wallis's could allow such a miserable platitude to stand. </p><p>In another lyric of the same class, he seems to have missed </p><p>Heine's meaning entirely, and turns a bit of imaginative pathos </p><p>into a flat prosaism:-­ </p><p>	They both of them loved, but neither</p><p>		The truth to tho other would say;</p><p>	They met so proudly and coldly,</p><p>		While both were pining away.</p><p>	They parted at length, and in future</p><p>		Encounter'd in dreams alone;</p><p>	They died long since, and to neither</p><p>		The fate or the other was known.</p><p>The two last lines in the original are-- </p><p>	Sie waren langst gestorben</p><p>	Und wussten es selber kaum­-</p><p>meaning that the state of separation from each other was so like death, that death was hardly a change. </p><p>Again, Mr. Wallis entirely loses the point of Sonnet III. He renders the concluding lines thus:­ </p><p>	For when fair Fortune's gifts are from Us reft,</p><p>	And broken by the hand of destiny;</p><p>	And when the fragments at our feet are flung;</p><p>	And when the heart within our breast is wrung,</p><p>	Wrung, rent, and wounded irrecoverably,--</p><p>	A bitter laugh is all that we have left.</p><p>In the original the last line is </p><p>	Dann bleibt uns doch das schone gelle Lachen.</p><p>This does not mean--nothing is left to us but laughter. It means--laughter is still left to us. And Heine valued that residuum considerably. </p><p>We were bound to indicate the deficiencies in Mr. Wallis's book, and to warn the reader that it will not in the least qualify him to pronounce on Heine's merits as a poet. But there is no need to dwell longer on those deficiencies, and we may now do what is more agreable--give a specimen of Mr. Wallis's more successful efforts as a translator. Here is a little poem which he has rendered at once closely and poetically:­-</p><p>	My love, we sat together,</p><p>		Alone in our fragile bark.</p><p>	The night was still, and we floated</p><p>		Over the waters dark.</p><p>	The spirit Isle, the lovely,</p><p>		Lay dim in moonlight trance;</p><p>	Sweet sounded magic music,</p><p>		And waved the misty dance.</p><p>	The music grew sweeter and sweeter</p><p>		The dance waved to and fro;</p><p>	But we, on the wide, wide ocean,</p><p>		Floated in silent woe.</p><p>STORY OF A BLUE-BOTTLE. </p><p>La Folle du Logis. Par Leon Gozlan. 		London: D. Nutt.</p><p>HAVE you ever seen a huge blue-bottle buzzing in all the contentment that sunshine and the vicinity of a good larder can give, suddenly entangled in the web of an ill-conditioned spider, who is lurking in the corner ready to pounce on his victim, and nourish his venomous body on its innocent juices? It is an entomological tragi-comedy has many parodies in human society--parodies which Balzac, of all artists, best loved to describe; witness inspiration of Balzac, of all artists, best loved to describe; witness his incomparable Cure de Tours. M. Leon Gozlan, apparently under the inspiration of Balzac, gives us, in the volume of tales which he rather whimsically calls La Folle du Logis, some new versions of the blue-bottle and spider drama, under the title of Les Petits Machiavels. Here is a sketch from the best of these stories, which will, perhaps, interest the admirers of the Scenes de la Vie de Province. </p><p>M. Maes, a rich Belgian merchant, had become possessor, in May, 1837, of an enviable property on the banks of the Seine, not very far from Villeneuve, comprising, besides a charming villa and stables, a garden, conservatory, pleasure-grounds, with statues and labyrinths--in short, everything a retined merchant could desire as his elysium after traversing the world from Antwerp to Java. To crown his happiness, he had excellent health and was a bachelor, proof against all the assaults of coquetry. With a constitution which had resisted yellow fever, and a sensibility which had resisted matrimony for two-and-forty years, he was sure at once of his heart and his stomach. You can conceive the sensations with which M. Maes took his first walk in his garden, with his hands under his coat-tails, in all the glories of proprietorship! The sun was shining with the splendour of commencing June on garden, corn-field and meadow, and, above all, on the river--that river which promised endless fishing, the ruling passion of M. Maes. The close neighborhood of the river had chiefly decided him to purchase Folie Margot at rather a bouncing price, and he had provided himself with all the apparatus dear to the piscatorial imagination. How happy M. Maes was going to be! He almost envied himself as he thought of the thrill with which he should perceive his line vibrating to the bite of a twenty-pound carp. Next to fishing, like a true Belgian, he loved flowers, and there was a whole army of them at his feet. He stooped to gather a tulip, and on rising saw, about two paces from him, a man as short and fat as himself, with little grey eyes sunk deep into his head, and a costume between a miller's and a mason's. The stranger bowed as low as the parabolic section of his body would permit, and smiled elaborately. "You are the gardener, doubtless?" "No, Monsieur Maes, I am Nicolas Merrain, your poor neighbour, the owner of that slip of ground, no bigger than a pocket-hankerchief, that lies between your property and the river. I come to bid you welcome, Monsieur Maes." "And what crop does your ground yield you, Monsieur Merrain?" "Pebbles in summer, mud in winter. But I have an affection for it; my poor wife used to come and wash her linen there in her life-time. I esteem you for it, Monsieur Merraine. We shall be good neighbours, I see." "You do me a honour in thinking so, Monsieur, and if in anything you need my poor services--" "What is your trade, my good friend?" "I do a little of all sorts. I buy standing crops; I buy old buildings when they are not too dear, and sell the materials by lot." As M. Maes, in haste to make the tour of his grounds, bade his new neighbour good day, that worthy murmered to himself, "I shall make a good job of it. This man must be fond of fishing."</p><p>You see at least one spider on the watch for our human blue-bottle. But he, happy in not knowing his coming unhappiness, smoked his cigar with a new relish as he sauntered in his garden the next morning. All at once he perceives that his domain, which has two gates towards the Villeneuve road, has no outlet at all towards the Seine. How, then, did the former owners of Folie Margot get down to the river? Pooh! The reason was simple. They could not have cared about fishing. M. Maes lost no time in sending for a mason, but no sooner was a breach made in the wall than it disclosed the figure of that obliging neighbour Nicolas Merrain, who with his former unctuous politeness is charmed to think that M. Maes will enjoy having a door that opens on the river, because M. Maes is an excellent man, and he, Nicolas Merrain, who of all things dislikes the idea of being a bad neighbor, had been constrained to build up a similar door which had been made by the former proprietors of Folie Margot. "This fellow built up a door like mine?" said M. Maes to himself. "Then I can only go to the river by his indulgence. How is it my notary did not acquaint me with this?" But he prudently suppressed his annoyance, and, afraid to offend a man who could put a veto on his fishing, accepted his proposition to furnish him with a document to fit it up. </p><p>The weeks rolled on and M. Maes, in the enjoyment of uninterrupted fishing, forgot his momentary annoyance at his subjection to Nicolas Merrain. He avoided all advances towards acquaintance made by neighboring proprietors, for what company can do more for you than a carp, which serves as your amusement one day, and your dinner the next? One morning, as he was angling opposite to a boat in which one of his neighbors came to fish with a regularity equal to his own, he became aware that he had hooked a tremendously heavy fish. At the same moment, his vis-a-vis perceived his bait dragged with the same force. The prey was a carp weighing twenty pounds, and of corresponding voracity, for it had swallowed both baits at once. Now ensued a contest of politeness, each being quite sure that the fish belonged to his neighbor. At length, the unknown rival consented to accept the fish on condition that M. Maes would come and partake of it at his table. The stranger, we see, had hooked two heavy fish at once. </p><p>On returning home the vexation of having made an acquaintance in spite of himself, was not at all alleviated for M. Maes by his receiving a bill of three hundred francs from Nicolas Merrain, for putting up his new door. Three hundred francs for a door not worth ten! But Nicolas Merrain must not be offended, so M. Maes paid the three hundred francs, inwardly resolving that he would let his neighbor have nothing to do with the building of a new summer-house which he contemplates in the highest part of his pleasure-grounds. The next day our Belgian betakes himself, according to engagement, to the house of his new acquaintance, M. Cornillard (who is no less a personage than the receiver-general), on the opposite bank of the river. While the carp is going through the last stages of the culinary mysteries, the two proprietors walk amongst the flowers, discussing, like other well-bred persons whose acquaintance is only beginning, a variety of subjects of which they are mutually ignorant, until at last they arrive at the perfectly lucid question, "I think we are neither of us married?" Note well that this question was put by M. Cornillard. "I am not married," said M. Maes, "because I love liberty, and hate children. If a child were to break one of my cups of Dresden china, I think I should break its head." "But suppose you were to take the precaution of having no Dresden china?" "Give up china and have children! You are joking." "Then you should see if it would not be possible to marry and keep the china without having children. The thing is possible; the age of your wife might reconcile everything." At this moment a formidable voice cried by a speaking trumpet, "The dinner is ready, uncle!" "My niece calls us," said M. Cornillard. "You will see her--a charming person; not absolutely young, but with admirable qualities." On entering the diningroom, M. Maes started to see a bony figure, six feet high, on the confines of five-and-forty, with a nose which would have made an excellent finger to a sun-dial. This divinity, whose name was Palmyre, wielded, as a symbolic sceptre, a feather brush by way of duster. During dinner, Mademoiselle Palmyre, who had been hitherto silent, suddenly rose, and pounced, brush in hand, on M. Maes s coat-collar. The pacific Belgian thought she had descried a venomous insect. No! It was a grain of dust. "Ah," said Cornillard, "Mimire has such a passion for cleanliness. She dusts the very trees. You, too, who are a Belgian, must love cleanliness." On conducting his neighbor home in the evening, M. Cornillard observed, "Now the acquaintance is made, I hope we shall see each other sometimes." "Very often," replied M. Maes, meaning "as seldom as possible." You see there is another spider spreading his web for our unconscious blue-bottle.</p><p>M. Maes, a little hastened by a spirit of vengeance towards Nicolas Merrain, proceeded forthwith to the construction of his summer-house. Nicolas saw everything but seemed to see nothing, though every plank he had not furnished entered into his soul. The only change observable in him was that he doubled his politeness, and that he avoided passing through M. Maes s ground to his own, choosing rather to make a long circuit, or to reach it by the river. One morning, as the Belgian, bent on fishing, had set his foot outside the door on Merrain s ground, he was meekly requested to observe that he was treading on cultivated soil--on land dedicated to carrots and turnips, and that he had no right to pass. M. Maes got angry. Nicolas remained honey-sweet, but firm, and in the end M. Maes did not proceed to the river, but went instead, fuming, to his notary, who was unable to deny that Nicolas was standing on a real right. An advocate is next consulted, who advises M. Maes to compromise the matter. After a struggle, the obese Belgian ire gives way, and Nicolas Merrain is asked what sum he will accept for his contemptible piece of ground. "Ten thousand francs, without abatement." The Belgian ire rises again, in spite of obesity, and M. Maes turns his back on Nicolas, observing, with anything but friendly significance, "that they shall meet again." The dispute had meanwhile become the talk of the neighborhood. Wherever the unhappy M. Maes appeared, there was always someone at hand to say, "That is M. Maes, who is at law with Nicolas Merrain." Such was the cruel position of the man who had come to Folie Margot in the hope of peace and quietness and unlimited fishing! He unbosomed his sorrows to his neighbor Cornillard, who told him that Merrain would not have dared to behave so to a Frenchman. M. Maes, as a stranger, lacked the sympathies of the neighborhood. "If you were only a Frenchman, or married to a Frenchwoman -" "He is talking about marriage again," thought M. Maes; "can he want me to marry his niece? Never, never!" he groaned, as he walked away with despair in his soul. For two months, he confined himself within his own grounds, and it was all the while the most magnificent weather for fishing. The very carp seemed to taunt him as he watched them from his summer-house, while they bounded in the river. </p><p>One morning, he could endure it no longer. He seized his line, marched defiantly through Merrain s ground, jumped into his boat, and had an ecstatic day of fishing. On reaching home, a summons was handed to him. A summons! Nicolas Merrain had seen all. M. Maes consulted another advocate, who discovered that the Commune has the power of reclaiming the fatal strip of ground on the payment of a slight indemnity to Merrain. But how was the Commune to be induced to take this step in which it had no real interest? A new mayor was to be elected in a week; M. Maes must be that mayor, and he could then obtain what he pleased of the Commune. "But," urged M. Maes, "no one in the Commune knows me." "Yes; you have just told me that M. Cornillard, the receiver-general, knows you. He is omnipotent over the municipal council. Apply to him." The advocate was ready to aid M. Maes in the matter, because he dreaded being elected mayor himself. Time pressed, so M. Maes hurried to the receiver-general who found the idea an excellent one, and was ready to give his services. But one good turn deserves another. M. Cornillard has a niece, fit to constitute the happiness of any man. He will make a present of her to M. Maea, whom he will be delighted to have for a nephew. "But I had sworn never to marry?" "People always come to that in the end." "Nevertheless, you yourself -" "I am a widower for the second time. Still, nothing obliges you to marry Palmyre." "But if I don t marry her I shall not be mayor, and if I am not mayor -O mon Dieu!" M. Maes asked three days for decision. To avoid marrying Palmyre he even brought himself to call on Nicolas Merrain and offer him the ten thousand francs. They were refused: it was clear to Nicolas that the slip of ground had risen in value. M. Maes, furious, wrote to M. Cornillard that he accepted Mdlle. Palmyre with her feather brush.</p><p>A few days later, M. Maes became mayor and the husband of Mdlle. Palmyre. Nicolas Merrain s ground was claimed by the municipality, and was converted by the mayor into a public washing-ground. Nicolas turned pale for an instant. But a short time afterwards it was stated in the newspapers that a terrible outrage had been committed on the property of M. Maes, a rich Belgian. Trees had been torn up by the roots, walls pulled down, the roof of the house taken completely off. M. Maes and his wife had only escaped by a miracle from the malefactors, who had hitherto succeeded in eluding the inquiries of justice. Six months after this catastrophe, Folie Marlot was sold by auction, and had become the property of a certain speculator in purchases at forced sales, named Nicolas Merrain. </p><p>M. Maes and his charming spouse had set out for Java. The blue-bottle had ceased even to struggle, and the spiders were triumphant. </p><p>THE ART AND ARTISTS OF GREECE. </p><p>PROBABLY many readers will be glad to hear of a German work which tells the history of Greek Art neither in the bald fashion of an introductory manual nor with the elaborate pedantry of a German Dryasdust, but with that agreeable combination of philosophic insight picturesqye narration, and poetic enthusias, to be found only in minds that have prepared themselves for a special study by thorough general culture. Such a work is Torso, by Adolph Stahr, a writer whose Jahr in Italien--two volumes of Italian travel, exhibiting rare artistic feeling as well as knowledge--prepared its readers to welcome from him a book more exclusively dedicated to art. It is a book not written to settle vexed questions or to present any new results of independent research, but simply to give such a view of Greek art as will enable ordinarily cultivated persons to understand its organic relation to human development and to have an intelligent and appreciatory enjoyment of its remains. Critics of a more negative disposition, and possibly of greater technical acquirement than Professor Stahr, will assail him for his too admiring attitde towards ancient art; and a certain tendency toawards the oracular in his manner of writing will probably provoke them to detect many errors of statement or of judgment. But the "general reader"--by whom, we imagine, is usually meant a reader of no particular information--is likely to find Torso an acceptable book, which will conduct him through a pleasant region of knowledge without causing him the least weariness in the journey. German writers have too often the uneasy pace of the camel--they take us to many remote quarters which we could ahrdly reach without their aid, but they cause us much aching and grumbling in the process. Stahr, however, has a style as agreeable as the canter of a well-trained horse. If it ever divides our attention with his subject, it also divides our admiration.</p><p>Was Greek art a purely indigenous growth, or only a transplantation from the East? This question of genealogy, of course, presents itself in the first place to the historian, and with especial urgency to the German historian, who, of all others, feels constrained to commencer par le commencement. Winckelmann pronounced against the suppostition of an Oriental origin; and German critics, more coerced by his authority than by arguments from facts and analogy, went on maintaining the same opinion </p><p>* Torso. Kunst, Kunstler und Kunstwerke der Alten. Von. Adolph Stahr. In zwei Theiler. London: D. Nutt. </p><p>long after it had been renounced by the best foreign critics. When at length Ludwig Ross returned from his travels in the Levantine countries, and brought evidence for the filiation of Oriental and Greek art, gathered from a careful investigation of art-remains, he was derided as a "Tourist "--a superficial man, who allowed his opinions to be modified by observation, instead of spinning them, as a philosophic spider should, from a theory secreting sac provided for the purpose! However, since then, there have been plenty of German critics who have not only accepted the newer idea, but have been its most laborious and valuable illustrators. Stahr follows in their track, treating the question in a rapid and popular way. The reference of Greek art to an Oriental source brings it, he observes, under a generalization which is more and more confirmed by the discoveries of science and scholarship--namely, that </p><p>the process of development in culture and art is the same as that of natural products and their cultivation by man. Modern botanical research has proved that almost everything which is necessary, useful, and agreeable to us in the vegetable kingdom, came in a gradual procession frorn Asia, until it was arrested at the western coast of Europe. And now that after a short rest it has sprung across the Atlantic, this propagation pursues its course through America towards the West. But the West receives the gifts of the East only to refine the rude, to develope the imperfect, to ennoble the common. </p><p>In the AEginetan sculptures we see Greek art beginning to emancipate itself from Oriental and Egyptian symbolism, and advancing towards naturalism. But still, though the artist gave a high degree of finish to the limbs, he was incompetent or indifferent to the rendering of expression or character in the face. Athene is like the Trojans, and the Trojans are like the Greeks. In this respect the AEginetan sculptures present an interesting point of contrast with the works of Giotto, which hold a corresponding position in the development of Italian painting. Giotto and his immediate successors, in opposition to the early Greek artists; threw all their power into the face, and seemed to regard the body as an insignificant appendage to it. This difference in the order of artistic progress corresponds with the fundamental difference between Greek and Christian conceptions. To the Greek, a fine body was the primary condition of a fine mind; but to the spiritualism of the fourteenth century the body was but the transient and unworthy dwelling of the immortal soul, which f!ourished in proportion as the body was emaciated. Its canon of art was--</p><p>	Give us no more of body than shows soul.</p><p>It seems a great leap to pass from the AEginetan sculptures to those of the Parthenon, in , which we see art at its highest point of development as an essentially religious and political outgrowth. Yet we have no knowledge to fill up the chasm, and to show us how far the immense advance was due to the individual genius of Phidias, how far it was prepared by his predecessors. The age of Phidias, being the period of supreme interest in the history of Greek art, is naturally also the most delightful part of Professor Stahr's book. From inference, from historic details, and also from mythical anecdotes, which always have their historic significance, he forms as vivid a picture as can be obtained of Phidias in his position as an artist; he reconstructs the Parthenon, and enables us to imagine it as it stood in its glory; he tells the sad story of its destruction, and describes with very fine discrimination the fragments which remain to us--the only works we posses that come immediately and indisputably from the genius of Phidias. Among the sculptures which may with probability be regarded as copies from his originals, is one of the famous Colossi on the Monte Cavallo, and we single it out from the rest for the sake of giving a legend admirably characteristic of the mode in which the mediaeval mind explained the relics of classic antiquity. The reader probably remembers that the Colossi just mentioned are two groups, each representing a man controlling a restive horse, one of them being inscribed with the name of Phidias, the other with that of Praxiteles. The legend we are going to quote is contained in an Explanation of the Wonders of Rome, written in monkish Latin of the twelfth century:- </p><p>In the time of the Emperor Tiberius (says the mediaeval Winckelmann) there appeared in Rome two young philosophers, Phidias and Praxiteles, who showed themselves openly without any clothing. When the Emperor was informed of this, he summoned them before him, and asked them, Why they went about naked? They answered: "Because everything lies naked and open before our eyes, and because we regard the world as nought--therefore we go about naked and possess nothing." On account of this wisdom of theirs, the Emperor raised them high in his palace. But they boasted of such science that they knew everything the Emperor did, even when out of their presence, by day and by night, and could tell it him to a word; so they said to him: "We will tell thee everything thou hast spoken when away from us, by night in thy chamber." "If you do that," answered the Emperor, "I will give you whatever you desire." Thereupon they said: "We desire no money, but only a monument." The next morning they related to the Emperor, in order, the counsel he had held with himself in the preceding night, and the Emperor, as he had promised, founded for them the desired monument, namely, naked horses which tread the earth beneath their hoofs, that is, which trample on the powerful of this world who rule over men. But, as a sign that the mighty king will come, who will mount these horses, that is, will subdue the powerful ones of the earth, there stand by the horses two half-naked figures of men, who, with uplifled arm and clenched fist, announce what will then come to pass. And as they are themselves naked, so does all earthly knowledge lie naked before them. </p><p>The works of Polykletos and Myron, the great contemporaries of Phidias, with those of Praxiteles and Scopas in the succeeding age, are subjects wide enough to carry us nearly to the end of the first volume--leaving room, however, for a long chapter on the Social Position of the Artist in Greece, and a discussion of the colouring and nudity of Greek statues. Apropos of Scopas, who was the most fertile originator of grotesque ideal beings as attendants on the deities, Stahr observes that, when the Greeks conceived combinations of the human with the brute form, they made the upper part human and the lower part bestial, as in the centaurs, satyrs, mermaids, &amp;c., while we see the reverse in the symbolism of the Egyptians. Like many other ingenious distinctions, however, this will not bear a very rigid examination. The sphinx, at least, might have occurred to him as a sufficiently remarkable exception.</p><p>Lysippus, whose history opens the second volume, was the first great master of portrait sculpture. But in all cases of origination or discovery, it is "the hour and the man," and not the man alone, that accomplishes the transition from the old to the new. Lysippus was the contemporary of Alexander, and with the Macedonian conquests began a new political relation for art. The glory of the individual was no longer checked by democratic jealousy--the days of royal patronage began, and art glorified royalty in return. An amusing indication of the change that had come over the spirit of art is the story told by Plutarch of the sculptor Stasikrates. This artist went to Alexander, and proposed to him to fashion Mount Athos into an imperishable statue of the conqueror of the world, which should touch the sea with its foot and the clouds with its head, holding in one hand a populous city, and with the other pouring a perpetual mountain torrent into the sea. Alexander was wise enough to bid him leave Mount Athos alone. </p><p>The revival of Greek art under Roman patronage is treated very fully by Professor Stahr; but we have touched on points enough in his agreeable volumes. They are easily accessible, and readers of German will find it worth while to look into Torso for themselves. </p><p>PICTURES OF LIFE IN FRENCH NOVELS. </p><p>HENRY MURGER is a very popular novel writer in France. He excels in the extravagantly humorous, and his Vie de Boheme is read by the admirers of the style buffoon with explosions of laughter. In that novel he gives us an abundance of that intentional absurdity which is the privilege of wit; but when he enters on a more serious vein, he sometimes gives us that peculiar kind of unintentional absurdity which is the privilege of the sentimental French novelist. In Le Dernier Rendezvous, the first of two tales contained in the volume before us, the heroine is one of those ladies who cut off their hair on the slightest provocation, and startle a lover by suddenly placing in his hand cette magnifique chevelure noire, without the head it adorned--who never hear their lover's name without blushing, raising one hand to their forehead to hide their blushes, and placing the other on their poitrine agitee--who quit their husband's home some fine morning, with no more than a petit paquet of clothing which never wants renewing--who sublimely ignore that base necessity, an income--and, in short, innocence excepted, live in all respects like the lilies of the field. "They sow not, neither do they spin," and you have the smallest possible confidence in their knowledge of the multiplication table. Any man a little fatigued with the commonplace qualities of a wife who bears in mind that "black hair," once lost, is not easily renewed, who finds a moderate allowance of pin-money indispensable--and who has been initiated into that department of arithmetic called "bills of parcels," will do well to read such tales as Le Dernier Rendezvous. He will return from them with new relish for "human nature's daily food"--a woman who has some knowledge of common things, and some sense of common obligations. </p><p>La Resurrection de Lazare is a different sort of story, written more in the epigrammatic than the sentimental style. It is called a drame en lettres, each of the dramatis personae contributing his quota to the drama in the shape of letters. The Lazarus in question is not the brother of Martha and Mary, nor is the resurrection one of the body from a literal tomb. As the reader may be curious, we will extract the drama from the letters and tell it in brief. The Lazarus of M. Murger is a genius--a poet of this nineteenth century, who is to initiate a great literary revolution. At the opening of the drama, however, this high destiny is not apparent, except to the prophetic eye of friendship; for during the last four years Lazarus has been wasting his patrimony and his time, and tarnishing his beau nom, by a life of mad Parisian dissipation--a conscious victim to the Mephistophelean temptations of two cynical rakes, the Vicomte Seraphin and Comte Antony de Sylvers. At the age of eight-and-twenty he has so exhausted the possibilities of life and imagination that even the diabolical ingenuity of his two friends is unable to devise anything that can astonish him. Still there is one sacred spot in his memory, one window in his mind, through which heaven's daylight shines in on the fumes and the gaslight. He has once seen at the opera a woman whose calm loveliness (and blond complexion set off by blue ribbons) so impressed itself on his imagination that he bas painted a miniature of her from memory. At last, sick of his Parisian life, he has entered on the second stage of his Byronic career, and retreated to a cottage at Verrieres, where he spends his days in solitary roaming through the woods. In the background is a certain M. de B., a grand poete, the self-elected providence or good genius of Lazarus, who opposes his protecting watchfulness to the machinations of the evil genii, Antony and Seraphin, and induces another poet (not great) named Theodore, to act as deputy providence in the shape of valet to Lazarus. Now opens the story.</p><p>Late one evening, on returning from his rambles, Lazarus, as he is about to enter his house, sees a body of some sort precipitated with great force from his bedroom window. While he is gazing, with the unwonted sensation of astonishment, at the said body, which proves to be that of an elegantly-dressed woman (with blue ribbons!) a crowd collects in his gardens, the gensd'armes appear, and he is arrested as a murderer. At this point, </p><p>*Le Dernier Rendezvous. La Resurrection de Lazare. Par Henry Murger. London: Jeffs. </p><p>there appears on the spot Madame Marie d'Alton--a lady possessed of all charms, and residing in great privacy at Verrieres, who has risen from her bed on hearing that her mysterious neighbour, the mad poet, has assassinated a woman, and who from a benevolent impulse, has repaired to the scene of action. She finds a lovely woman lying pale and blood-besprinkled on the ground, and Lazarus standing with folded arms, looking on with calm contempt at the indignant crowd and the inquiring police. Marie d'Alton has the woman carried to her house, and laid in her own bed, and Lazarus is carried off to prison at Versailles, where he is disappointed to find that it is impossible to poser with effect as a martvr, owing to the delicate consideration exhibited towards criminals. He thinks of betaking himself to the classic amusement of taming spiders, but the elegant salon he occupies gives no promise of zoological specimens. He entreats his gaoler to furnish him with a spider, and that functionary presents him with a carte des distractions, in which a tame mouse is charged five francs, a tame spider four, and an untamed spider two and a-half. We leave Lazarus lamenting the prosaism of modern prisons, and return to Verrieres. The houri with the strongly gravitating body, on whom Marie d'Alton has taken compassion, is neither more nor less than a danseuse of the Cirque, who, being madly in love with Lazarus, had been easily prompted by Antony and Seraphin to attempt the conquest of his resolute indifference by a tour de force. She had spent all her money in buying splendid apparel for the occasion--had come from Paris, and gained admission into the house by means of her acquaintance, Theodore--had sprinkled a little blood over her clothes by way of heightening the effect, and on hearing the footsteps of Lazarus, had executed in perfect safety her terrible saut perilleux en arriere from the window. She had meant to take the heart of Lazarus by assault--and she had caused him to be sent to prison as her assassin! However, if he will not love her, she will make him feel her power by continuing to act the assassinated woman. She allows a doctor (a lover in disguise) to dress her unfractured skull, and accepts the devoted nursing of Marie d'Alton. And who is Marie herself? The beloved of Count Antony de Sylvers, for whose sake she has given up friends and fortune--being one of those astonishing women who, with the utmost intellectual and moral insight, are unable, on the most intimate acquaintance, to discern the difference between a shallow, vicious egotist and a man worthy of all devotion. In the meantime, Lazarus has written to his friend Seraphin, begging him to send him a small tortoise-shell box, which will be found at his lodgings. Seraphin finds the box, does not send it, but does open it, and discovers in it a miniature of Marie d'Alton--of course, the miniature painted from memory, by Lazarus; of his unknown Hebe. Seraphin, exulting in a discovery which promises annoyance to many people at once, writes to Louisa, the dansense, taunting her with the failure of her stratagem, and crowning his taunts by announcing to her that Lazarus loves Marie d'Alton. This letter, having fallen into the hands of Marie, is communicated by her to Antony, who regards it as a proof that his false friend Seraphin is conspiring to rob him of Marie. A duel is the consequence, and Antony is killed. Before the catastrophe, Louisa has induced Theodore to escort her on a visit to Lazarus in prison, where she makes a last attempt on his obdurate heart, by telling him their relative position. He receives her story with contemptuous indignation, and in her jealous rage she reveals the fact that his unknown adored one is Marie d'Alton. Does the reader foresee the denonement? Louisa relents, and confesses the truth to a magistrate--Lazarus is set at liberty, and declares his love to Marie d'Alton, who discovers that she has been unconsciously giving him the precedence in her heart from the time he began to interest her at Verrieres. And now Lazarus, a wiser but not a sadder man, enters on his great career, and is saluted by M. de B. in a dithyrambic letter as the poet who, "l'aurore de la poesie et de la religion renouvelee, viendra proclamer la divinite de la matiere immortelle!" Louisa marries Theodore, and is not happy ever after.</p><p>Since this story is so very far from real, there is probably some moral to which its idealism points. For our own part, we choose to draw a moral of our own, after the fashion of Renzo in I promessi sposi, and we deduce the following piece of advice, which we offer to our feminine readers:--When you wish to conquer a man's heart, do not begin by throwing yourself out of the window. </p><p>BELLES LETTRES AND ART (JULY 1856). </p><p>THE difference between fashion and fame, between the art which appeals to transient taste or prejudice and the art which appeals to the permanent sympathies of mankind, is well seen in the fate of our popular dance music.

But if you were now to pipe these tunes in the market-place, we suppose even the children would feel no impulse to dance; the jig has ceased to be a habit of English limbs; its last echoes have died from the English ear. And abundance of quadrilles and polkas, to which every street organ has been set for a twelve month, have followed "Off she goes" to the limbo of forgotten tunes, while many an older air, such as "When first I saw thy face," played by some band at a watering-place on a sunshiny morning, will equally arrest the butcher's boy who is passing with his empty tray, and the bilious connoisseur who is reposing from the fatigues of operatic criticism. </p><p>It is much the same with novels. "The Vicar of Wakefield" is never threadbare, though we began to read it when we were eight years old, and have been reading it, in quotations and pictures, ever since; it is as inexhaustible as a really fine melody. But the majority of the novels that rise above the dead level of the circulating library, and are read by other than idle women and apprentices, have about the same order of merit, and the same duration of popularity, as the old jig music they lend themselves to the favourite dance of the hour. They are the novels that flatter a prejudice, that speak the lingo of a clique, or that further the purposes of party propagandism. Take them up a few years later, when the fashion or the party they represented has died out, and you are amazed that they could have made even a passing sensation. For their writers have none of that genius which is greater than its intentions; which sets out meaning to make life prove the truth of a sectarian dogma or justify a party cry, and, mastered by its own creative impulse, ends by giving a picture of life that endures when dogma and party are forgotten; which sets out meaning to vent a personal pique, and ends by producing an immortal satire. They are novels in which cleverness goes to work with a narrow intention, and accomplishes what it intends; they are "Tales for the Times," and vanish with the times. </p><p>To this order of novels belongs "Perversion,"  except that, instead of a "Tale for the Times," it should rather be called a tale for the "season," which it is not likely to outlast. The author tells us in his Preface, that it is the object of his pages to illustrate the causes and consequences of infidelity. "The causes of infidelity," he says, "are different in different characters; its consequences are the same in all moral deterioration, and the loss of happiness and peace." Although we might think this position a little too absolute, it did not incline us to prejudge the merits of "Perversion" as a fiction. For, as we have just said, genius is often greater than its intentions, and it is quite possible that a novelist should even make it his object to illustrate such a position as that "all fat people are virtuous, and all thin people vicious," and yet produce a very remarkable novel. For, if he</p><p> "Perversion; or, the Causes and Consequences of Infidelity. A Tale for the Times." London: Smith and Elder. 1856.</p><p>had arrived at this conviction through his experience, he might reproduce that experience with artistic power; he might give us such admirable portraits of fat saints and thin sinners, and might throw such thrilling interest into the vicissitudes of their lives, that we should quite forget his mistake as to the foundation of ethics. Hence, we began "Perversion" not without hope that it might turn out to be a striking book; but we were disappointed. It has not the elements of a good novel. The story is uninteresting; the character-sketching is approximative, coarse, and often feeble; the satire is without finesse; there is little appeal to the emotions; and the power of dramatic representation is entirely absent. The general characteristic of the first two volumes and half the third, is unamiable dulness, occasionally relieved by unamiable cleverness something like a heavy cake flavoured with the wrong spice. It is not till the middle of the third volume that the writer touches us with a little pathos, or shows us that there is any sort of human being he finds admirable. </p><p>The story is briefly this. Charles Bampton, a boy of a rather susceptible and poetic nature, is placed in a large school, where, being a junior, he undergoes the usual amount of oppression from his elders, especially from a clever, vicious lad, named Armstrong, who terrifies him into writing home for money under false pretences. This offence is discovered; and Bampton, desperate in the prospect of disgrace and punishment, runs away from school, and, after much suffering, rejoins his mother at her pleasant home in Cornwall. Here he spends the few years' interval before his departure for Eton, under the instruction of a German tutor, and in the companionship of a favourite sister, Clara, who shares his studies and his tastes, and to whom he is passionately attached. When once he is at Eton, we leave him to follow the fortunes of Armstrong, who, having been expelled from school, obtains a commission in the army when he is only seventeen, and through one of his brother officers becomes acquainted with the "Socinians," whose organ is the "Progressive Review," and whose favourite author is Mr. Neulicht. They teach him to consolidate the passive unbelief of a vicious boy, who dislikes the moral restraints of Christianity, into a systematic structure of infidelity, and thus help him on in his rapid progress towards atheism and the denial of a moral sense. He runs away with his colonel's mistress, intending to deceive her with a false marriage; perjures himself, by swearing that he is of age, in order to obtain a licence, which is to serve as a blind to her, and is, after all, entrapped into a real marriage. A duel between him and his colonel ensues, and the result is that Armstrong has to quit the army. His prospects in England being ruined, he sails for America with his Julia,  of whom he is already thoroughly tired, joins the Mormons at New Orleans, disposes of his wife to the chief representative of the Mormons there, and at length, having received the news that his uncle has died, leaving him an estate on condition that he shall adopt the name of Archer, he returns to England, disburthened at once of a wife and of a surname which has ugly associations. He is now only twenty-one, and determines to begin his new life by spending three years at Oxford, as the best preparation for carrying out his schemes of ambition. It happens that he enters the very college that has just been selected for Charles Bampton. The old schoolfellows meet; but though Bampton has a vague sense of old remembrances being stirred by the sight of Archer, the new name and a sabre-cut on the forehead unite with the effect of years in preventing that recognition which Archer is extremely anxious to avoid. We have then sketches of college life, in which Archer figures as a Mephistopheles, taking on himself a great deal of gratuitous exertion in order to corrupt young men, by first shaking their belief in Christianity, and then enticing them into vicious courses. Bampton escapes gross vice; but his religious principles are utterly undermined, and his repulsion towards Christian doctrines and Christian teachers is increased when, on a visit to his mother, he finds her settled in a fashionable town, in a perfect nest of clerical hypocrites. His repulsion is shared by his sister Clara, who remains his dearest friend and confidante. The greater part of the second volume is occupied with sketches of popular clergymen, Evangelical and Puseyite, of college freethinkers, and of snobbish manufacturers at Cottonham; but at length, the story moves on a little. Archer, who has begun to distinguish himself as a writer in the "Vane," and feels himself on the way to other kinds of distinction, has accompanied Bampton on a tour to the Lakes, where he meets Clara, falls in love with her, and induces her to become his wife. But their married happiness is soon disturbed by the reappearance of Julia, Archer's first wife; who, having become disgusted with her Mormon life, has managed to escape, first to California, and again to England, carrying with her some Californian gold. She enters an action against her husband for bigamy, in the first instance without success, but having afterwards found an ally in Archer's attorney, whom he has imprudently offended, she succeeds in getting him convicted, not only of bigamy, but of perjury. Under this accumulation of woes Clara commits suicide, employing the last hours of her life in writing a statement of the feelings and convictions which are actuating her, to her brother. This terrible catastrophe deepens the dissatisfaction already existing in Charles Bampton's mind with his negative views on religion. With symptoms of hopeless consumption in his constitution, and deprived of what he has loved best in life, he finds himself without consolation and without hope; and the remainder of the book is occupied with tracing the influences through which he at length finds repose in the Christian faith, whereupon he determines to devote the rest of his short life to missionary labour at Scutari, and dies there, desiring to have no other inscription on his tomb than C. B. In Christo.</p><p>This story, though not in itself ingenious or interesting, offers some good situations, and abundant opportunities for very varied sketches of social life. But the writer has not shown the faculty that can use such opportunities well. The life of the school and the home life of the brother and sister, are merely described, not presented; and these, as well as many other parts of the book, read rather like an account or sketch of a novel than like the novel itself. It is a sufficient indication of this deficiency to say, that throughout the first volume there is hardly any dialogue, except where the writer wishes to exhibit theoretic opinions and arguments; and though in the early part of the second volume a little more dramatic spirit is thrown into the narrative, it soon relapses into dull description. The situations and characters are all treated in a superficial, conventional style. The "German teacher" is merely the traditional Teuton, with no more specific traits than deficient linen, a prejudice in favour of the knife as a prehensile instrument, and a tendency to "cloud-built speculations;" the scenes of Mormon life are a very vulgar treatment of a grave as well as curious phenomenon which wise people will let alone until we have more authentic information; the attempt at depicting Cottonham society is merely a gross exaggeration of a single and occasional characteristic; and the "Champions of Progress,"  Mr. Buzzard, the newspaper editor, Miss Fife, the strong-minded woman, and Dr. Grobman, the ma terialistic physician are drawn in that sketchy, generic fashion, which may tell in an article, but is quite ineffective in a novel. The portraits of the "Tractarian," "Recordite," and "Millenarian" clergymen, are more special studies, and are painted, we imagine, with all the gusto of fraternal dislike. Indeed, many readers, unless they persevere to the latter part of the third volume, will be puzzled to understand the writer's mode of "illustrating" the moral benefits of Christianity, since his Christians seem on the whole no better than his infidels, and a great deal more silly. The impression likely to be left by "Perversion" is not so much that only Christians are good, as that most men are good for nothing; and we should imagine that dislike to people in general is a much stronger feeling with the author than attachment to Christians in particular. One good Christian woman, and one or two good clergymen, introduced towards the end of the story, do little to counterbalance this impression. The moral odour of the book is bad. There is the readiest imputation of the worst motives to all kinds of people; and it is clear that in the writer's View Christian charity has nothing to do with abstinence from abusing and slandering such men as Goethe and Carlyle. He seems too "knowing" for us to be able to set down his misrepresenation of Opinions to well-meaning one-sidedness; and while he spends hard words on "cold Pantheists," and alludes to "kicking Atheists down stairs," as if that were an action familiar to Christians, we have an unpleasant sense that he has dined with both Pantheists and Atheists without any disturbance of his digestion; and that his experience has been too extensive for him not to be aware that heroism, mercy, and purity, are not irreconcilable with heterodoxy. The mere " writing" of "Perversion" is so ordinary, that we should not have noticed it, but that certain grave critics, dazzled, we must think, by rumours of distinguished authorship, and perhaps not seeing much else to praise, have made it the object of special eulogy. For our own part, we see in it no felicity of phrase or epithet, no epigrammatic salt, no concrete vigour, nothing that distinguishes the style of the superior writer from that of the merely educated and facile contributor.</p><p>The only other novels that have fallen under our notice from amongst the abundant fiction of the quarter, are " Beyminstre"  and "Maurice Elvington."  "Beyminstre" depends for its interest on the delineation of quiet provincial life; it belongs to that genus of novels in which Miss Austen and Balzac have given us too high a standard to allow of our being easily satisied. The writer has one essential faculty of the novelist: he (or she?) knows how to tell a story dramatically; but unhappily he has not the art of making us believe in his characters. There is an elaborate presentation of Winny Hopper, the intriguing, toadying, old-young lady; but after all she remains a puppet to us, and not a woman whom we can imagine ourselves seeing and knowing. And to this absence of the creative power that produces vivid conceptions in the reader, are often added the positive faults of exaggeration and absurdity; such, for instance, as the brutal rudeness of the Puseyite clergyman, and the description of the heroine's complexion as having the " transparent radiance of a ground-glass lamp." Still, we got to the end of "Beyminstre" without much effort, especially as the interest of the story is intensified towards the close. We can hardly say so much for "Maurice Elvington," which begins rather smartly, but becomes gradually dull, and occasionally dismal. There is some merit, however, in the picture of the honest lawyer, Mr. Gently, and his family; and of the thorough-bred peer, Lord Budesdale.</p><p>Our list of poets is headed by no less a name than that of Victor Hugo, who has just given a new collection of poems to the world.4 We recommend any one who takes up "Les Contemplations," and who distrusts his own power of persevering through two rather stout volumes of French poetry, to turn at once to the beginning of the second volume, where he will find a series of poems in memory of a loved and lovely daughter, who apparently was taken from M. Hugo in 1843, a few months after her marriage. There are touches in these poems such as real affection and real sorrow only can inspire; and every heart that has known a great loss will feel itself in sympathy with the poet, and will thank him for letting others share in this exquisite expression of his grief. The cold winds of calamity and death sweep over us all; but it is only the poets amongst us from whom they call forth delicious tones like these, and such tones ought not to die out unheard. We delight especially in those simple, tender verses which recal the daughter's image as she was in her childhood, and we must indulge ourselves in quoting a few of these, taken here and there, from various poems: </p><p>"Elle avait pris ce pli dans son age enfantin </p><p>De venir dans ma chambre un pen chaque matin; </p><p>Je l'attendais ainsi qu'un rayon qu'on esp re; </p><p>Elle entrait et disait: 'Bon jour, mon petit p re;' </p><p>Prenait ma plume, ouvrait mes livres, s'asseyait </p><p> "Beyminstre."

The echoes of the Tennysonian music predominate in these poems, as they do in most volumes of verse that we open; for example, in "Grace and Remembrance,"6 a little volume which opens with a series of poems addressed to Shakspeare, against which we have nothing to say except that we feel none the richer for reading them: they have no particular fault, but we feel that we are listening to an echo, and not a voice.</p><p>"W'eil dir ein Vers gelingt in einer gibildeten Sprache, </p><p>Die f r dich dichtet un denkt, glaubst du schon Dichter zu sien?" </p><p>"Do you think yourself a poet because you can produce passable verses in a cultivated language which sings and thinks for you?" So says Goethe at least if we may trust the recollection of Schiller's wife, who attributes this couplet to Goethe, though it is found in Schiller's works and the admonition might be of service in England now, no less than in Germany half a century ago. </p><p>Not, indeed, to Mrs. Phillipson,7 whose verses can hardly be said to have either song or sense in them, but rather, jingle and nonsense. This lady, having habitually solaced her "lonely hours" with writing sentimental doggrel, has liberally offered a thick volume of that literary commodity to the public, in the form of a new and enlarged edition, accompanied with a portrait conveying a very high idea of her personal charms charms which we can only regard as a kind compensation of Nature for the imbecility exhibited in her verses. </p><p>A republication of quite a different character, is a new edition of Mr. Edmund Peel's Poems,8 which have already been long enough before the public to dispense with our criticism. </p><p>The last of our poetical volumes is Miss Parkes's " Gabriel."?

It recals the chief incidents of Shelley's life, and apparently it is Shelley's wife who is supposed, almost throughout, to be the speaker. This is a disadvantage, since it raises a demand for psychological verisimilitude which Miss Parkes has not satisfied. No sooner do we begin to perceive that Gabriel is Shelley, and that it is his wife who is singing to us of his early genius, his college days, and his spiritual struggles, than a new ground of criticism is introduced, and the poem has to justify itself not merely by lyrical beauties but by dramatic presentation. This mistake in structure, and the occasional obscurity and want of finish in the more emotional and reflective parts of the poem, are in some degree counterbalanced by the beauty of many descriptive passages, in which we think Miss Parkes shows a certain vein of poetic power, as well as poetic susceptibility. Here, for example, are a few stanzas from the description of the fine old country house, which opens the poem: </p><p>"I know a house, its open doors </p><p>Wide set to catch the scented breeze, </p><p>While, dimpling all the oaken floors, </p><p>Faint shadows of the swaying trees </p><p>Pass in and out like spectral things, </p><p>Dim creatures born of summer light, </p><p>Till through the deepening twilight springs </p><p>A paler radiance of the night. </p><p>"Then softly in those silent hours </p><p>Fair faces grow upon the gloom, </p><p>And whisper'd words of unseen powers</p><p>Breathe inward with the garden bloom </p><p>And lawns smooth-mown with punctual shears; </p><p>While over roof and threshold falls </p><p>The peace of many a hundred years. </p><p>"Unfolding slow their ivory fringe, </p><p>The lilies lie upon the pond; </p><p>The firs have caught the sunset tinge, </p><p>And murmur, elfin-like, beyond: </p><p>I think whoever sought that grove, </p><p>To dream an hour of love or heaven, </p><p>Might, wrapt in some strange mystery, rove, </p><p>And find his year had grown to seven! </p><p>"Great elms, a glorious altar-veil, </p><p>Screen off the yellow evenino' skies, </p><p>'Mid whose thick branches, blue and pale, </p><p>The geni smoke doth curling rise, </p><p>And, wavering in the waveless air, </p><p>A certain tender touch impart </p><p>To what were else too calmly fair; </p><p>Like memory in some heaven-taught heart. </p><p>"Across the broad unbroken glade </p><p>Which girds this house on either hand, </p><p>The beech-clumps sprinkle showers of shade;  </p><p>These outposts of the forest stand </p><p>And guard the kingdom of the deer, </p><p>The stillness of their charm'd domain, </p><p>Where Spring chimes matins every year, </p><p>And autumn leaves fall down like rain. </p><p>"For miles these beeches rise and fall, </p><p>And ripple like some inland sea; </p><p>From dough to bough the wood-birds call, </p><p>And squirrels nest in every tree: </p><p>Blue depths of distance melt away </p><p>And all the open slopes are gay </p><p>With foxgloves and the tangled fern." </p><p>Mr. Trench's study of Calderon,  contained in a small volume that may easily be slipped into the pocket, is likely to be attractive to many readers, both because Mr. Trench's name is a recommendation and because Calderon is anything but a hackneyed subject in English literature. The volume contains an Essay on the Life and Genius of Calderon, followed by poetical translations from one of his most popular dramas, "Life's a Dream," and from one of his Autos or religious-allegorical pieces, "The Great Theatre of the World;" the translation, in both cases, being connected by prose passages, which give an abstract of the omitted scenes. We are not of the small minority who can pronounce on the merits of Mr. Trench's work from the level of equal knowledge; since, however, he cannot be supposed to have written for that small minority, but for the general public, who are not familiar with Spanish literature, our very want of special information may enable us the better to judge of his success. The initiated are apt to look at a result through the medium of the difficulties they know to have been conquered; the uninitiated see only the positive value of the result. As among the uninitiated, then, we must confess that the translations in this volume do not in the least help to convince us that Calderon merits the high position Mr. Trench assigns to him as a poet. Now and then there occurs a rather graceful passage which is rendered more felicitously than usual, but the general texture of the translations seems to us extremely poor, and the long speeches put into the mouth of Sigismund, in "Life's a Dream," eminently wanting in dramatic fitness. In the introductory Essay, the opinion expressed concerning Calderon is not supported by a forcible statement of reasons, or by adequate illustrations, so that the reader is likely to lay down the volume with only a vague impression. Occasionally, however, he will be arrested by a good remark, such, for example, as this on the exuberant productiveness of great poets:  "Almost all poets of a first-rate excellence, dramatic poets above all, have been nearly as remarkable for the quantity as the quality of their compositions; nor has the first injuriously affected the second. Witness the seventy dramas of  schylus; the more than ninety of</p><p> "Life's a Dream: The Great Theatre of the World." From the Spanish of Calderon. With an Essay on his Life and Genius, by Richard Chenevix Trench. London : J. W. Parker and Son. 1856.</p><p>Euripides; the hundred and thirteen of Sophocles; and, if we consider the few years during which Shakspeare wrote, his fruitfulness is not less extraordinary. The vein has been a large and copious one, and has flowed freely forth, keeping itself free and clear by the very act of its constant ebullition, and the fact is very explicable; it is not so much they that have spoken, as their nation that has spoken by them." </p><p>We are still among the poets when we take up Professor Masson's literary " Essays,"  which derive a value, over and above that belonging to a republication of articles that well deserve to be rescued from the oblivion of "back numbers," from the admirable biography of Chatterton, now for the first time published in its enlarged form. We have all noticed how an awakened interest brings about apparent coincidences, how, if we learn the meaning of a word or the scientific explanation of a fact one day, we happen to get some additional information about it the next; the "coincidence" being due to the quickening of a new susceptibility in ourselves rather than to any unusual juxtaposition of external things. But there is really an unusual coincidence uniting with an awakened or a re-awakened interest, when any of those who have been admiring Wallis's picture of the "Death of Chatterton," take up Mr. Masson's volume containing the life of the poet; for the volume and the picture were presented to the public nearly at the same time. Here is a biography told without exaggeration, without any unwarranted use of hypothetic incidents, yet surpassing the most highly-wrought fiction in its power over our emotions; for, if we have healthy sympathies, imaginary beings can never so stir our pity or our piety as the real beings of the past, as the sufferers or the heroes of whom we can say,</p><p>"Such as these have lived and died." </p><p>To this advantage which the true story of a remarkable life has over fiction, are added, in Mr. Masson's life of Chatterton, the vivid reproduction of details, the psychological insight, and the wise charity which are amongst the most important characteristics of a good biography. We abstain from further criticism, that we may find room for a quotation, which we hope will interest our readers as much as it interested us. Protesting against the shallow theory that the tenour of Chatterton's life is to be explained merely by the supposition of his insanity, Mr. Masson proceeds to notice that predominant mental feature which was certainly the strongest determining cause of his peculiar career, namely, his veneration for the antique, the earliest form of which was his passionate attachment to the fine old Gothic church of St. Mary Redcliffe, at Bristol, whence, as our readers will remember, Chatterton professed to have obtained the Rowley manuscripts. The nature of this attachment Mr. Masson very felicitously: </p><p>"Some time aoro we saw in a provincial Scottish newspaper an obituary notice of a poor idiot named John M'Bey, who had been for about sixty years a</p><p> "Essays, Biographical and Critical: chiefly on English Poets." By David Masson, A.M. Cambridge: McMillan and Co. 1856.</p><p>prominent character in the village of Huntly, Aberdeenshire. Where the poor creature had been born, no one knew; he had been found, when apparently about ten years old, wandering among the Gartly Hills, and had been brought by some country people into the village. Here, 'supported by the kindness of several families, at whose kitchen tables he regularly took his place at one or other of the meals of the day,' he continued to reside ever after a conspicuous figure in the schoolboy recollections of all the inhabitants for more than half a century. The 'shaggy carroty head, the vacant stare, the idle trots and aimless walks of 'Jock,' could yet,' said the notice, 'be recalled in a moment' by all that knew him. 'At an early period of his history,' proceeded the notice, 'he had formed a strong affection for the bell in the old ruined church of Ruthven, in the parish of Cairnic; and many were the visits he paid to that object of, to him, surpassing interest. Having dubbed it with the name of 'Wow,' he embraced every opportunity at funerals to get a pull of the rope, interpreting the double peals, in his own significant language, to mean, 'Come hame, come hame.' Every funeral going to that churchyard was known to him; and, till his old age, he was generally the first person that appeared on the ground. The emblems of his favourite bell, in bright yellow, were sewed on his garments; and woe to the schoolboy that would utter a word in depreciation of his favourite. When near his end, he was asked how he felt. He said 'he was ga'in awa' to the wow, nae to come back again.' After his death, he was laid in his favourite burying-place, within sound of his cherished bell.' </p><p>"Do not despise this little story, reader. To our mind it illustrates much. As this poor idiot, debarred from all the general concerns of life, and untaught in other people's tenets, had invented a religion for himself, setting up as a central object in his own narrow circle of images and fancies an old ruined belfry, which had somehow (who knows through what horror of maternity?) caught his sense of mystery, clinging to this object with the whole tenacity of his affections, and even devising symbols by which it might be ever present to him, so, with more complex and less rude accompaniments, does the precocious boy of Bristol seem to have related himself to the Gothic fabric near which he first saw the light. This church was his fetich, his 'wow.' It was through it, as through a metaphorical gateway, that his imagination worked itself back into the great field of the past, so as to expatiate on the ancient condition of his native 'Brystowe' and the whole olden time of England. </p><p>"This is no fancy of ours. 'Chatterton,' says one of his earliest acquaintances, the Mr. William Smith above mentioned, 'was particularly fond of walking in the fields, particularly in Redcliffe meadows, and of talking of his manuscripts, and sometimes reading them there. There was one spot in particular, full in view of the church, in which he seemed to take particular delight. He would frequently lay himself down, fix his eyes upon the church, and seem as if he were in a kind of trance; then, on a sudden, he would tell me, 'That steeple was burnt down by lightning; that was the place where they formerly acted plays.' ' To the same effect, also, many allusions to the church in the Rowley poems; thus: </p><p>"'Thou seest this maestrie of a human hand, </p><p>The pride of Bristowc and the western land.' </p><p>And here we may remind the reader of a circumstance mentioned above, namely, that the ancestors of Chatterton had, for a hundred and fifty years, been sextons of this same Church of St. Mary Redcliffe, and that the office had only passed out of the family on the death of his father's elder brother John. Chatterton's father, too, it should be remembered, was a choir-singer in the church; and Chatterton himself, while a child, had, in virtue of old family right and proximity of residence, had the run of its aisles and galleries. Can it be, we would ask the physiological philosophers, that a veneration for the edifice of St. Mary Redcliffe, and for all connected with it, had thus come down in the Chatterton blood; that, as it were, the defunct old Chattertons, Johns and Thomases in their series, who had, in times gone by, paced along the interior of the church, jangling its ponderous keys, brushing away its cobwebs, and talking with its stony effigies of knights and saints buried below, had thus acquired, in gradually increasing mass, a store of antique associations, to be transmitted as a fatal heritage to the unhappy youth in whom their line was to become extinct and immortal?"</p><p>It is the memory of a poet that renders interesting, or at least excusable, the publication of a thick volume containing the correspondence of Schiller's wife with a dear friend. Genius is the proximate cause of great books, the remote cause of big books; and we have especial reason for bearing this fact in our minds in connexion with German literature. Still, reflecting on the reputation women have long had as charming letter-writers, and remembering that Schiller's wife, besides being a very cultivated woman, moved in the society of such men as Goethe, Herder, Fichte, Knebel, Schlegel, &amp;c., we took up this correspondence with more than ordinary eagerness.  Unhappily, the volume keeps none of its promises. The letters are simple, friendly notes written to Knebel, detailing the current nothings of the day. In vain do we seek for any anecdotes or glimpses of the remarkable persons among whom she lived; they are casually mentioned, but that is all. Indeed, it was enough to tell Knebel that Goethe was well, or that Herder was busy; that the duke had gone on a journey, and the duchess was anxious about her son. It was what he wanted to know; we want more precise details. Moreover, we expect to hear something of dear Schiller and his domestic happiness; but Schiller is seldom mentioned, the majority of the letters being written after his death. Of Goethe we read nothing noticeable even as gossip; and the only fragment which caught our attention on Weimar's central figure was at p. 312, where she mentions the arrival of Charlotte Kestner, the original of VVerther's Lotte, "a very pretty woman advanced in the sixties. Splendid eyes and good figure still remain to her, and a fine profile; but alas! her head shakes, and one sees how perishable are earthly things. She finds Goethe much altered. She is clever and cultivated, and takes great interest in public events." And then we hear that the geheime Kammer thin Riedel, who figures in " Werther" as the naseweise Blondine, also sat quiet and composed beside them, "and so the hand of Time works over men, and that alone which we feel and experience remains living with us. The yellow leaves fall around me as symbols of human lot. Only the feeling of steadfast good-will, and the love of friends, can carry us into brighter regions, and these we will cling to."</p><p>Schiller's wife paints herself in these friendly notes, and the picture is thoroughly amiable. Her culture was considerable, her interest in almost all forms of intellectual activity remarkable; but she does not exhibit much talent in any direction. A soft, sympathizing, German nature, free from gall and pettiness, and quite without pretension; we </p><p> "Briefe von Schiller's Gattin an einem vertrauten Freund." Herausgegeben von Heinrich Diintzer. Leipzig: Brockhaus. 1856.</p><p>imagine her to have been better fitted for the poet's wife than her sister Caroline would have been, although we do not think so on the grounds stated by Schiller himself. It is known that Schiller was in love with both sisters, that is to say, he felt for them the sort of affection which, with him, passed for love a passion he seems never to have known. Charlotte wrote to him, complaining that he loved her sister Caroline better than he loved her. His reply is remarkable. "Caroline is nearer to me in age," he writes, "and hence we are more alike in the form of our thoughts and feelings. She has drawn more of my impressions and emotion into speech than you have, my Charlotte; but I would not for the world that this should be otherwise that you should be other than you are. What Caroline possesses more than you, you must receive from me; your soul must unfold itself in my love, and you must be the being of my creation; you must blossom in the Spring of my love. If we had met each other later in life, I should have lost this sweet joy of seeing you bloom for me."</p><p>The frequent complaint of the sameness there is in women's minds and characters, is curiously contradicted when we have to make such transitions as that from the mild, domestic Charlotte von Lengefeld, to the brilliant, ambitious Marie de Rohan, of whom we now get a more vivid conception by the aid of M. Victor Cousin. This writer has latterly relinquished philosophy for literature; and few readers will complain when, instead of a hash of German metaphysics, they get a piquant dish of semi-historical biography. We have already, in these pages, characterzied his previous studies of the women of the seventeenth century, and have now to add to the portraits of Madame de Longueville and Madame de Sabl , the more romantic story of La Duchesse do Chevreuse.  Readers of the Revue des Deuce Mondes may be warned, that this volume contains nothing about Madame de Chevreuse beyond what was contained in the article which, early in this year,</p><p>M. Cousin printed in that journal, and has here reprinted. The bulk of the volume is eked out with notes et pi ces justificatives, of some interest to historical students, but certain to be skipped by every ordinary reader. The biography, however, was worth reprinting, for it has the interest of romance, with the additional interest of throwing some light on the state of society in France during those troublous times. Marie de Rohan was a beautiful, impetuous, restless, intriguing duchesse, who "loved much, and many," and who espoused the political ambitions of her lovers, sharing their perils, aiding their schemes, and making herself an influence dreaded by Richelieu and Mazarin. All this is told with great spirit and finesse by M. Victor Cousin, and in a style which years ago enabled him to throw fascination even into abstract questions. But it is somewhat ludicrous to observe his pretension in the Preface, of having invented a new method of historical composition, which, according to him, "consists, on the one hand, in laying aside all hypotheses, conjectures, vague theories, conventional tirades, abstractions </p><p> "Madame de Chevreuse et Madame de Hautefort. Nouvelles  tudes sur les Femmes Illustres du XVII. si cle." Par M. Victor Cousin. Paris: Didier and Co. 1856.</p><p>and approximations, and, by dint of research, penetrating to the real and certain facts, so difficult to recover after the lapse of years; and, on the other hand, in not being content with the mere external aspect of events, but in endeavouring to detect their particular, immediate, personal causes, those which live in the hearts of men, in their sentiments, their ideas, their virtues, and their vices; in a word, to study in history the lessons of humanity, which for us is the grand and supreme study, the immortal basis of all sound philosophy." One must be familiar with the magniicent manner of Frenchmen, or passages like these will seem incredible. "Nous exposerons plus tard cette m thode," he grandly adds, having no misgiving whatever of the platitudes he is uttering. </p><p>Another variety in feminine character is suggested by the name of Margaret Fuller, whose "Summer on The Lakes," and "Letters from Europe," written for the New York Tribune, together with some of her latest private letters to friends in America, are now collected into a volume, under the common title of "At Home and Abroad." 4 The letters from Europe are no more interesting than the newspaper correspondence of American travellers usually is, until her arrival in Italy, when they acquire both a personal and historical interest. It is very pleasing to read the warm testimony which a close observer like Margaret Fuller bears to the noble conduct of Mazzini, both in the days of revolutionary triumph and of revolutionary tribulation. In closing her very last letter to the Tribune, she says, "Mazzini I know, the man and his acts, great, pure, and constant a man to whom only the next age can do justice, as it reaps the harvest of the deeds he has sown in this."</p><p>When our imaginations are once at Rome, it is easy for them to glide on to Thorwaldsen, to whom it was a second fatherland the land which cherished and brought to maturity the artist-nature in him, and where he chiefly spent forty-one years of his long life. Thiele's valuable biography of the great sculptor 5 has now reached the second volume, which brings us to his departure from Rome, in 1838, nearly six years before his death. In the lives of men of genius, it is usually the time of their early struggles that we care most to read about; and our interest in them is often in inverse proportion to their comfort and success. On this ground, perhaps, the second volume of Thorwaldsen's life will not fetter its readers so strongly as the first; nevertheless, it abounds in interesting details, and among these we may mention, without being led too far for our limited space, the incidents which connect the exercise of Thorwaldsen's art with the beautiful Albanese girl, Vittoria Cardoni. One summer evening, in the year 1820, Kestner (son of Werther's Lotte), Secretary of Legation in the Hanoverian Embassy at Rome, as he was riding through the little town of Albano, was struck with the extreme beauty of a girl, about thirteen years of age, who sat </p><p> 4 "At Home and Abroad; or, Things and Thoughts in America and Europe."

A couple of days later, he went with a friend to call on the poor vine-dresser and his wife, who owned this lovely girl for their daughter, and induced the mother to bring Vittoria, dressed in her pretty Albanese costume, that he might introduce her to the family of the German Ambassador, then resident in the neighbourhood. Every one was fascinated by her marvellous beauty, heightened by her noble carriage and picturesque dress; and when the Ambassador's family returned to Rome in the autumn, his wife, the Baroness von Reden, invited thither Vittoria, with all her family, that the artists there might have the opportunity of reproducing this rare beauty. Sculptor after sculptor modelled her bust, and the painters, with Horace Vernet at their head, strove to do justice to her in portraits, of which there are no less than twenty-four in existence. But all confessed themselves vanquished in the contest, and unanimously declared that not one of them had seized the entire beauty of their model. The most curious fact, however, in this little history, is, that when the various busts and portraits were compared, there were scarcely two that bore any resemblance to each other an additional proof that each man sees things not as they are, but as they appear through his peculiar mental media. Thorwaldsen tried his hand with the rest, but was not more successful. He subsequently used his bust of Vittoria for the head of the young mother with her children in the group of "John the Baptist preaching in the Wilderness," which he executed for the Church of the Virgin at Copenhagen. </p><p>Another book which will be acceptable to those who delight in the biography of artists, is Mr. Bohn's republication of Duppa's "Life of Michael Angelo, " and Quartrem re de Quincy' s "Life of Raphael," both contained in one volume of the "Illustrated Library." 6 </p><p>Before we pass from works on artists to works on art, we may fitly introduce M. Scudo's "Critique et Litt rature Musicales," 7 since much of his criticism refers to musical artists. M. Scudo speaks exceedingly well of his own book in his Preface, and informs us that its success it has now reached a third edition has confirmed him in his belief, "que le beau est  ternel comme le juste!" He is equally in admiration of his own authorship in the Introduction, where he informs us that we shall find in his volume, "comme un tableau de l'histoire de la musique depuis l'av nement du Christianisme jusqu'  nosjours." After this, one is surprised to find him opening with a personal attack on Liszt, who is evidently his favourite aversion we should imagine for reasons rather private than public, since M. Scudo is vague when he treats of Liszt's faults as a musician, and is only particular on his dress and demeanour, his white gloves, and the cut of his hair. The criticism is bitter rather than poignant. Seeing that the "tableau de l'histoire de la musique" began with Liszt, we supposed that it would unroll itself backward, and we turned to the</p><p> 6 "The Lives and Works of Michael Angelo and Raphael." By R. D6uppa and Quatremere de Quincy. London: Bohn' s "Illustrated Library." 1856</p><p> 7 Critique et Litt rature Musicales." Par P. Scudo. Paris: Hachette and Co. 1856.</p><p>end of the volume to see if we should not then find ourselves in the period of the "av nement du Christianisme. " But, to our surprise, we find it ending with Sontag and Rosina Stoltz! M. Scudo would have done wisely to introduce his book with less pomp, and to have asked the reader quietly to accept it for what it is a series of articles, moderately agreeable and instructive, on music and musical artists. </p><p>An interesting study for architects and antiquaries is offered in a splendid volume on the "History and Antiquities of St. David's." 8 The cathedral of St. David's stands supreme amongst existing Welsh churches, Llandaff being the only one that approaches it in size or beauty. Both have this feature in common that their surrounding "city" is a mere village. "But Llandaff . . . . . has nothing of the st1angely awful character delived from the position of St. Davids. The richer character of the country round, the neighbourhood of a large and busy town, take off much from the wild majesty which is so distinctive of St. David's. Without the utter desolation of the surrounding country, and the entire separation from all traces of man besides its own narrow world, a large portion of the stern charm of 'ancient Menevia' would be completely lost . . . . . St. David's, standing erect amid desolation, alike in its fabiic and its establishment, decaying but not dead, neglected but never entirely forsaken, still remaining in a corner of the world with its services uninterupted in the coldest times, its ecclesiastical establishment comparatively untouched, is, more than any other spot, a link between the present and the past." Pity that our contemplation of such "links between the present and the past" should be disturbed, as it is in England, by vulgar associa tions! You arrive some sunshiny morning at a cathedral town, and think you will spend the half hour between the arrival and departure of the trains, in looking at the cathedral. But not being satisfied with a glance at the outside only, you peep through the half-open door, which perhaps has a chain or a locked gate before it, and you are immediately pounced upon by a fat sexton or a thin crone, who regards you as a prospective shilling, and offers to "show" you the cathedral. This is one of the opprobriums of Protestantism. To return to St. David's. The remarkable choice of a site for an Episcopal See at the extreme western point of South Wales well suited to heavenly contemplation, but extremely ill suited to the practical duties of an ecclesiastical "overseer" seems to be in some degree accounted for by the fact that its founder, St. David, combined the functions of an abbot with those of a bishop, and presided over a conventual establishment, according to a common practice in the British Church. It appears, however, that the subordinates in these hybrid establishments were not called monks, or bound by perpetual vows, though their discipline was ascetic, at least if we may believe the tradition that Morgeneu, the thirty-third from St. David, was the first bishop of Menevia who presumed to taste flesh, in consequence whereof he was slain by pirates,</p><p> 8 "The History and Antiquities of St. David's.

T </p><p>and after his death appeared to a certain Irish bishop, uttering this admonitory statement: "I ate meat, and they made meat of me." The description of the cathedral in this work is accompanied by numerous and admirable engravings. The history is elaborate, but never trivial or tedious; and it is altogether a book well written and well illustrated. </p><p>Last, not least, we have the fourth volume of Ruskin's "Modern Painters." 9 Its general contents appeal to a more direct interest in the landscape painter's art than was requisite for an appreciation of the third volume, which we reviewed in our last number; but still it is quite the smallest portion of the book that any real lover of nature will pass by as too technical. It has all the transcendant merits and all the defects of its predecessor; it contains an abundance of eloquent wisdom and some eloquent absurdity; it shows a profound love and admiration for the noble and the beautiful, with a somewhat excessive contempt or hatred for what the writer holds to be the reverse of noble and beautiful. This hatred is likely to grow, because Mr. Ruskin, in common with the majority of men, reckons it among his virtues. But allowing the utmost weight to adverse criticism, it remains another bright event in the year to have read another new volume of "Modern Painters." "Turnerian Topography," "Turnerian Light," and "Turnerian Mystery," are discussed in the first place, but they occupy no more than a hundred pages, and we then come to the great subject of the volume Mountain Beauty. The reader will thank us more for an extract or two from the fine things Mr. Ruskin says about mountains, than for any short and dry abstract, which would not even have the merit of a skeleton, but would only be fragments of dry bones. </p><p>Referring to the comparative rarity of the sublimest mountain scenery, he says, </p><p>"If the most exquisite orchestral music could be continued without a pause for a series of years, and children were brought up and educated in the room in which it was perpetually resounding, I believe their enjoyment of music, or understanding of it, would be very small. And an accurately parallel effect seems to be produced 11 on the powers of contemplation, by the redundant and ceaseless loveliness of the high mountain districts. The faculties are paralysed by the abundance, and cease, as we before noticed of the imagination, to be capable of excitement, except by other subjects of interest than those which present themselves to the eye. So that it is, in reality, better for mankind that the forms of their common landscape should offer no violent stimulus to the emotions, that the gentle upland, browned by the bending furrows of the plough, and the fresh sweep of the chalk down, and the narrow winding of the copse-clad dingle, should be more frequent scenes of human life than the Arcadias of cloud-capped mountain or luxuriant vale; and that, while humbler (though always infinite) sources of interest are given to each of us around the homes to which we are restrained for the greater part of our lives, these mightier and stranger glories should become the objects of adventure, at once the cynosures of the fancies of childhood, and themes of the happy memory, and the winter's tale of age." </p><p> 9 "Modern Painters." Volume IV., containing Part V. of Mountain Beauty. By John Ruskin, M.A. London: Smith and Elder. 1856.</p><p>We may connect this extract with Mr. Ruskin's remarks on the influence exerted over Shakspeare's genius by the scenery in which he was born. </p><p>"He seems to have been sent essentially to take universal and equal grasp of the human nature; and to have been removed, therefore, from all influences which could in the least warp or bias his thoughts. It was necessary that he should lean no way; that he should contemplate, with absolute equality of judgment, the life of the court, cloister, and tavern, and be able to sympathize so completely with all creatures as to deprive himself, together with his personal identity, even of his conscience, as he casts himself into their hearts. He must be able to enter into the soul of Falstaff or Shylock with no more sense of contempt or horror than Falstaff or Shylock themselves feel for or in themselves; otherwise his own conscience and indignation would make him unjust to them; he would turn aside from something, miss some good, or overlook some essential palliation. He must be utterly without anger, utterly without purpose; for if a man has any serious purpose in life, that which runs counter to it, or is foreign to it, will be looked at frowningly or carelessly by him. Shakspeare was forbidden of Heaven to have any plans. To do any good or get any good, in the common sense of good, was not to be within his permitted range of work. Not for him the founding of institutions, the preaching of doctrines, or the repression of abuses. Neither he, nor the sun, did on any morning that they rose together, receive charge from their Maker concerning such things. They were both of them to shine on the evil and good; both to behold unoffendedly all that was upon the earth, to burn unappalled upon the spears of kings, and undisdaining upon the reeds of the river. </p><p>"Therefore, so far as nature had influence over the early training of this man, it was essential to his perfeetness that the nature should be quiet. No mountain passions were to be allowed in him. Inflict upon him but one pang of the monastic conscience; cast upon him but one cloud of the mountain gloom; and his serenity had been gone for ever his equity his infinity. You would have made another Dante of him; and all that he would have ever uttered about poor, soiled, and frail humanity would have been the quarrel between Sinon and Adam of Brescia, speedily retired from, as not worthy a man's hearing, nay, not to be heard without heavy fault. All your Falstaffs, Slenders, Quicklys, Sir Tobys, Lances, Touchstones, and Quinces would have been lost in that. Shakspeare could be allowed no mountains; nay, not even any supreme natural beauty. He had to be left with his kingcups and clover; pansies the passing clouds the Avon's flow and the undulating hills and woods of Warwick; nay, he was not to love even these in any exceeding measure, lest it might make him in the least overrate their power upon the strong, full-fledged minds of men. He makes the quarrelling fairies concerned about them; poor lost Ophelia find some comfort in them; fearful, fair, wise-hearted Perdita trust the speaking of her good will and good hostess-ship to them; and one of the brothers of Imogen confide his sorrow to them, rebuked instantly by his brother for 'wench-like words;' but any thought of them in his mighty men I do not find: it is not usually in the nature of such men; and if he had loved the .owers the least better himself, he would assuredly have been offended at this, and given a botanical turn of mind to Caesar, or Orthello." </p><p> * * * * * * * *</p><p>"In such slight allusions as he makes to mountain scenery itself, it is very curious to observe the accurate limitation of his sympathies to such things as he had known in his youth; and his entire preference of human interest, and of courtly and kingly dignities, to the nobleness of the hills. This is most marked in Cymbeline, where the term 'mountaineer' is, as with Dante, always one of reproach; and the noble birth of Arviragus and Guiderius is shown by their holding their mountain cave as </p><p>"'A cell of ignorance ; travelling abed. </p><p>A prison for a debtor;' </p><p>and themselves, educated among hills, as in all things contemptible: </p><p>"'We are beastly; subtle as the fox, for prey; </p><p>Like warlike as the wolf, for what we eat: </p><p>Our valour is to chase what flies ; our cage </p><p>We make our choir, as doth the prisoned bird.' </p><p>"A few phrases occur here and there which might justify the supposition that he had seen high mountains, but never implying awe or admiration. Thus Demetrius: </p><p>"'These things seem small and indistinguishable, </p><p>Like far of mountains turned into clouds.' </p><p>Taurus snow,' and the 'frosty Caucasus,' are used merely as types of purity or cold; and though the avalanche is once spoken of as an image of power, it is with instantly following depreciation: </p><p>"'Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow </p><p>Upon the vallies, whose low vassal seat </p><p>The Alps doth spit, and void his rhenm upon.' </p><p>"There was only one thing belonging to hills that Shakspeare seemed to feel as noble the pine tree, and that was because he had seen it in Warwickshire, clumps of pine occasionally rising on little sandstone mounds, as at the place of execution of Piers Gaveston, above the lowland woods. He touches on this tree fondly again and again: </p><p>	"'As rough,</p><p>Their royal blood enchafed, as the rud'st wind, </p><p>That by his top doth take the mountain pine, </p><p>And make him stoop to the vale. </p><p>	"'The strong-based promontory</p><p>Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up </p><p>The pine and cedar.' </p><p>Where note his observance of the eculiar horizontal roots of the pine, spurred as it is by them like the claw of a bird, and partly propped, as the aiguilles by those rock promontories at their bases which I have always called their spurs, this observation of the pine's strength and animal-like grasp being the chief reason for his choosing it, above other trees, for Ariel's prison. Again:  </p><p>"'You may as well forbid the mountain pines </p><p>To wag their high tops, and to make no noise, </p><p>When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven.' </p><p>And yet again: </p><p>"'But when, from under this terrestrial ball, </p><p>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines.' </p><p>"We may judge, by the impression which this single feature of hill scenery seems to have made on Shakspeare's mind, because he had seen it in his youth, how his whole temper would have been changed if he had lived in a more sublime country, and how essential it was to his power of contemplation of mankind that he should be removed from the sterner influences of nature." </p><p>Here is a passage on one of the uses of mountains:  </p><p>"Every fountain and river, from the inch-deep streamlet that crosses the village lane in trembling clearness, to the massy and silent march of the everlasting multitude of waters in Amazon or Ganges, owe their play and purity, and power, to the ordained elevations of the earth. Gentle or steep, extended or abrupt, some determined slope of the earth's surface is of course necessary, before any wave can so much as overtake one sedge in its pilgrimage; and how seldom do we enough consider, as we walk beside the margins of our pleasant brooks, how beautiful and wonderful is that ordinance, of which every lade of grass that waves in their clear water is a perpetual sign; that the dew and rain fallen on the face of the earth shall find no resting-place; shall find, on the contrary, fixed channels traced for them, from the ravines of the central crests down which they roar in sudden ranks of foam, to the dark hollows beneath the banks of lowland pasture, round which they must circle slowly among the stems and beneath the leaves of the lilies; paths prepared for them, by which, at some appointed rate of journey, they must evermore descend, sometimes slow and sometimes swift, but never pausing; the daily portion of the earth they have to glide over marked for them at each successive sunrise, the place which has known them knowing them no more, and the gateways of guarding mountains opened for them in cleft and chasm, none letting them in their pilgrimage; and, from far off, the great heart of the sea calling them to itself! Deep calleth unto deep. I know not which of the two is the more wonderful, that calm, gradated, invisible slope of the champaign land, which gives motion to the stream; or that passage cloven for it through the ranks of hill, which, necessary for the health of the land immediately around them, would yet, unless so supernaturally divided, have fatally intercepted the flow of the waters from far-off countries. When did the great splrit of the river first knock at those adamantine gates? When did the porter open to it, and cast his keys away for ever, lapped in whirling sand? I am not satisfied no one should be satisfied with that vague answer, the river cut its way. Not so. The river found its way. I do not see that rivers, in their own strength, can do much in cutting their way; they are nearly as apt to choke their channels up, as to carve them out. Only give a river some little sudden power in a valley, and see how it will use it. Out itself a bed? Not so, by any means, but fill up its bed, and look for another, in a wild, dissatisfied, inconsistent manner. Any way, rather than the old one, will better please it; and even if it is banked up and forced to keep to the old one, it will not deepen, but do all it can to raise it, and leap out of it. And although, wherever water has a steep fall, it will swiftly cut itself a bed deep into the rock or ground, it will not, when the rock is hard, out a wider channel than it actually needs; so that if the existing river beds, through ranges of mountain, had in reality been cut by the streams, they would be found, wherever the rocks are hard, only in the form of narrow and profound ravines, like the well-known channel of the Niagara, below the Fall; not in that of extended valleys. And the actual work of true mountain rivers, though often much greater in proportion to their body of water than that of the Niagara, is quite insignificant when compared with the area and depth of the valleys through which they flow; so that, although in many cases it appears that those larger valleys have been excavated at earlier periods by more powerful streams, or by the existing stream in a more powerful condition, still the great fact remains always equally plain, and equally admirable, that, whatever the nature and duration of the agencies employed, the earth was so shaped at first as to direct the currents of its rivers in the manner most healthy and convenient for man. The valley of the Rhone may, though it is not likely, have been in great part excavated in early time by torrents a thousand times larger than the Rhone; but it could not have been excavated at all, unless the mountains had been thrown at first into two chains, between which the torrents were set to work in a given direction. And it is easy to conceive how, under any less beneficent dispositions of their masses of hill, the continents of the earth might either have been covered with enormous lakes, as parts of North America actually are covered; or have become wildernesses of pestiferous marsh; or lifeless plains, upon which the water would have dried as it fell, leaving them for great part of the year desert. Such districts do exist, and exist in vastness: the whole earth is not prepared for the habitation of man; only certain small portions are prepared for him, the houses, as it were, of the human race, from which they are to look abroad upon the rest of the world, not to wonder or complain that it is not all house, but to be grateful for the kindness of the admirable building, in the house itself, as compared with the rest. It would be as absurd to think it an evil that all the word is not it for us to inhabit, as to think it an evil that the globe is no larger than it is. As much as we shall ever need is evidently assigned to us owes its fitness for human life chiefly to its mountain ranges, which, throwing the superfluous rain off as it falls, collect it in streams or lakes, and uide it into given places, and in given directions; so that men can build their cities in the midst of fields which they know will be always fertile, and establish the lines of their commerce upon streams which will not fail."</p><p>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF GERMAN LIFE. </p><p>If the trial is to be made whether barbaric nations are to advance to high civilization through a stage of monotheistic belief, the real experiment will not be of the Exeter Hall sort, but with more or less resemblance to the process going forward at Sarawak. If those nations are to die out before European successors, the process will be hastened by Exeter Hall practices, and duly authenticated by the higher method. If the people should die out under Rajah Brooke's method, it will plainly be through a law of nature which cannot be resisted; a supposition which we see no reason to entertain. If they are to attain civilization otherwise than through any theological phase, the Exeter Hall method can do nothing but mischief, while the opposite one leaves room for natural laws to work out their end freely.

Dritte Auflage. 1856. </p><p>IT is an interesting branch of psychological observation to note the images that are habitually associated with abstract or collective terms-what may be called the picture-writing of the mind, which it carries on concurrently with the more subtle symbolism of language. Perhaps the fixity or variety of these associated images would furnish a tolerably fair test of the amount of concrete knowledge and experience which a given word represents, in the minds of two persons who use it with equal familiarity. The word railways, for example, will probably call up, in the mind of a man who is not highly locomotive, the image either of a "Bradshaw," or of the station with which he is most familiar, or of an indefinite length of tram-road; he will alternate between these three images, which represent his stock of concrete acquaintance with railways. But suppose a man to have had successively the experience of a "navvy," an engineer, a traveller, a railway director and shareholder, and a landed proprietor in treaty with a railway company, and it is probable that the range of images which would by turns present themselves to his mind at the mention of the word "railways," would include </p><p>52 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>all the essential facts in the existence and relations of the thing. Now it is possible for the first-mentioned personage to entertain very expanded views as to the multiplication of railways in the abstract, and their ultimate function in civilization. He may talk of a vast net-work of railways stretching over the globe, of future "lines" in Madagascar, and elegant refreshment-rooms in the Sandwich Islands, with none the less glibness because his distinct conceptions on the subject do not extend beyond his one station and his indefinite length of tram-road. But it is evident that if we want a railway to be made, or its affairs to be managed, this man of wide views and narrow observation will not serve our purpose.</p><p>	Probably, if we could ascertain the images called up by the terms "the people," "the masses," "the proletariat," "the peasantry," by many who theorize on those bodies with eloquence, or who legislate for them without eloquence, we should find that they indicate almost as small an amount of concrete knowledge-that they are as far from completely representing the complex facts summed up in the collective term, as the railway images of our non-locomotive gentleman. How little the real characteristics of the working-classes are known to those who are outside them, how little their natural history has been studied, is sufficiently disclosed by our Art as well as by our political and social theories. Where, in our picture exhibitions, shall we find a group of true peasantry? What English artist even attempts to rival in truthfulness such studies of popular life as the pictures of Teniers or the ragged boys of Murillo? Even one of the greatest painters of the pro-eminently realistic school, while, in his picture of "The Hireling Shepherd," he gave us a landscape of marvellous truthfulness, placed a pair of peasants in the foreground who were not much more real than the idyllic swains and damsels of our chimney ornaments. Only a total absence of acquaintance and sympathy with our peasantry, could give a moment's popularity to such a picture as "Cross Purposes," where we have a peasant girl who looks as if she knew L. E. L.'s poems by heart, and English rustics, whose costume seems to indicate that they are meant for ploughmen, with exotic features that remind us of a handsome primo tenore. Rather than such cockney sentimentality as this, as an education for the taste and sympathies, we prefer the most crapulous group of boors that Teniers ever painted. But even those among our painters who aim at giving the rustic type of features, who are far above the effeminate feebleness of the "Keepsake" style, treat their subjects under the influence of traditions and prepossessions rather than of direct observation. The notion that peasants are joyous, that the typical moment to represent a man in a smock-frock is when</p><p>English Peasants. 53 </p><p>he is cracking a joke and showing a row of sound teeth, that cottage matrons are usually buxom, and village children necessarily rosy and merry, are prejudices difficult to dislodge from the artistic mind, which looks for its subjects into literature instead of life. The painter is still under the influence of idyllic literature, which has always expressed the imagination of the cultivated and town-bred, rather than the truth of rustic life. Idyllic ploughmen are jocund when they drive their team afield; idyllic shepherds make bashful love under hawthorn bushes; idyllic villagers dance in the chequered shade and refresh themselves, not immoderately, with spicy nut-brown ale. But no one who has seen much of actual ploughmen thinks them jocund; no one who is well acquainted with the English peasantry can pronounce them merry. The slow gaze, in which no sense of beauty beams, no humour twinkles,-the slow utterance, and the heavy slouching walk, remind one rather of that melancholy animal the camel, than of the sturdy countryman, with striped stockings, red waistcoat, and hat aside, who represents the traditional English peasant. Observe a company of haymakers. When you see them at a distance, tossing up the forkfuls of hay in the golden light, while the wagon creeps slowly with its increasing burthen over the meadow, and the bright green space which tells of work done gets larger and larger, you pronounce the scene "smiling," and you think these companions in labour must be as bright and cheerful as the picture to which they give animation. Approach nearer, and you will certainly find that haymaking time is a time for joking, especially if there are women among the labourers; but the coarse laugh that bursts out every now and then, and expresses the triumphant taunt, is as far as possible from your conception of idyllic merriment. That delicious effervescence of the mind which we call fun, has no equivalent for the northern peasant, except tipsy revelry; the only realm of fancy and imagination for the English clown exists at the bottom of the third quart pot.</p><p>	The conventional countryman of the stage, who picks up pocket-books and never looks into them, and who is too simple even to know that honesty has its opposite, represents the still lingering mistake, that an unintelligible dialect is a guarantee for ingenuousness, and that slouching shoulders indicate an upright disposition. It is quite true that a thresher is likely to be innocent of any adroit arithmetical cheating, but he is not the less likely to carry home his master's corn in his shoes and pocket; a reaper is not given to writing begging-letters, but he is quite capable of cajolling the dairymaid into filling his small-beer bottle with ale. The selfish instincts are not subdued by the sight of buttercups, nor is integrity in the least established by</p><p>54 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>that classic rural occupation, sheep-washing. To make men moral, something more is requisite than to turn them out to grass. </p><p>	Opera peasants, whose unreality excites Mr. Ruskin's indignation, are surely too frank an idealization to be misleading; and since popular chorus is one of the most effective elements of the opera, we can hardly object to lyric rustics in elegant laced boddices and picturesque motley, unless we are prepared to advocate a chorus of colliers in their pit costume, or a ballet of char-women and stocking-weavers. But our social novels profess to represent the people as they are, and the unreality of their representations is a grave evil. The greatest benefit we owe to the artist, whether painter, poet, or novelist, is the extension of our sympathies. Appeals founded on generalizations and statistics require a sympathy ready-made, a moral sentiment already in activity; but a picture of human life such as a great artist can give, surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves, which may be called the raw material of moral sentiment. When Scott takes us into Luckie Mucklebackit's cottage, or tells the story of "The Two Drovers,"-when Wordsworth sings to us the reverie of "Poor Susan,"-when Kingsley shows us Alton Locke gazing yearningly over the gate which leads from the highway into the first wood he ever saw,-when Hornung paints a group of chimney-sweepers,-more is done towards linking the higher classes with the lower, towards obliterating the vulgarity of exclusiveness, than by hundreds of sermons and philosophical dissertations. Art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot. All the more sacred is the task of the artist when he undertakes to paint the life of the People. Falsification here is far more pernicious than in the more artificial aspects of life. It is not so very serious that we should have false ideas about evanescent fashions-about the manners and conversation of beaux and duchesses; but it is serious that our sympathy with the perennial joys and struggles, the toil, the tragedy, and the humour in the life of our more heavily-laden fellow-men, should be perverted, and turned towards a false object instead of the true one. This perversion is not the less fatal because the misrepresentation which gives rise to it has what the artist considers a moral end. The thing for mankind to know is, not what are the motives and influences which the moralist thinks ought to act on the labourer or the artisan, but what are the motives and influences which do act on him. We want to be taught to feel, not for the</p><p>Pictures of the People in Novels. 55 </p><p>heroic artisan or the sentimental peasant, but for the peasant in all his coarse apathy, and the artisan in all his suspicious selfishness.</p><p>	We have one great novelist who is gifted with the utmost power of rendering the external traits of our town population; and if he could give us their psychological character-their conceptions of life, and their emotions-with the same truth as their idiom and manners, his books would be the greatest contribution Art has ever made to the awakening of social sympathies. But while he can copy Mrs. Plornish's colloquial style with the delicate accuracy of a sun-picture, while there is the same startling inspiration in his description of the gestures and phrases of "Boots," as in the speeches of Shakspeare's mobs or numskulls, he scarcely ever passes from the humorous and external to the emotional and tragic, without becoming as transcendent in his unreality as he was a moment before in his artistic truthfulness. But for the precious salt of his humour, which compels him to reproduce external traits that serve, in some degree, as a corrective to his frequently false psychology, his preternaturally virtuous poor children and artisans, his melodramatic boatmen and courtezans, would be as noxious as Eugene Sue's idealized proletaires in encouraging the miserable fallacy that high morality and refined sentiment can grow out of harsh social relations, ignorance, and want; or that the working-classes are in a condition to enter at once into a millennial state of altruism, wherein everyone is caring for everyone else, and no one for himself.</p><p>	If we need a true conception of the popular character to guide our sympathies rightly, we need it equally to check our theories, and direct us in their application. The tendency created by the splendid conquests of modern generalization, to believe that all social questions are merged in economical science, and that the relations of men to their neighbours may be settled by algebraic equations,-the dream that the uncultured classes are prepared for a condition which appeals principally to their moral sensibilities,-the aristocratic dilettantism which attempts to restore the "good old times" by a sort of idyllic masquerading, and to grow feudal fidelity and veneration as we grow prize turnips, by an artificial system of culture,-none of these diverging mistakes can co-exist with a real knowledge of the People, with a thorough study of their habits, their ideas, their motives. The landholder, the clergyman, the mill-owner, the mining-agent, have each an opportunity for making precious observations on different sections of the working-classes, but unfortunately their experience is too often not registered at all, or its results are too scattered</p><p>56 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>to be available as a source of information and stimulus to the public mind generally. If any man of sufficient moral and intellectual breadth, whose observations would not be vitiated by a foregone conclusion, or by a professional point of view, would devote himself to studying the natural history of our social classes, especially of the small shopkeepers, artisans, and peasantry,-the degree in which they are influenced by local conditions, their maxims and habits, the points of view from which they regard their religious teachers, and the degree in which they are influenced by religious doctrines, the interaction of the various classes on each other, and what are the tendencies in their position towards disintegration or towards development,-and if, after all this study, he would give us the result of his observations in a book well nourished with specific facts, his work would be a valuable aid to the social and political reformer. What we are desiring for ourselves has been in some degree done for the Germans by Riehl, the author of the very re markable books the titles of which are placed at the head of this article; and we wish to make these books known to our readers, not only for the sake of the interesting matter they contain and the important reflections they suggest, but also as a model for some future or actual student of our own people. By way of introducing Riehl to those who are unacquainted with his writings, we will give a rapid sketch from his picture of the German Peasantry, and perhaps this indication of the mode in which he treats a particular branch of his subject may prepare them to follow us with more interest when we enter on the general purpose and contents of his works.</p><p>	In England, at present, when we speak of the peasantry, we mean scarcely more than the class of farm-servants and farm-labourers; and it is only in the most primitive districts, as in Wales, for example, that farmers are included under the term. In order to appreciate what Riehl says of the German peasantry, we must remember what the tenant-farmers and small proprietors were in England half a century ago, when the master helped to milk his own cows, and the daughters got up at one o'clock in the morning to brew,-when the family dined in the kitchen with the servants, and sat with them round the kitchen fire in the evening. In those days, the quarried parlour was innocent of a carpet, and its only specimens of art were a framed sampler and the best tea-board; the daughters even of substantial farmers had often no greater accomplishment in writing and spelling than they could procure at a dame-school ; and, instead of carrying on sentimental correspondence, they were spinning their future table-linen, and looking after every saving in butter and eggs that might enable</p><p>Permanence of Physical Type in the Peasantry.  57</p><p>them to add to the little stock of plate and china which they were laying in against their marriage. In our own day, setting aside the superior order of farmers, whose style of living and mental culture are often equal to that of the professional class in provincial towns, we can hardly enter the least imposing farm-house without finding a bad piano in the "drawing-room," and some old annuals, disposed with a symmetrical imitation of negligence, on the table; though the daughters may still drop their h's, their vowels are studiously narrow; and it is only in very primitive regions that they will consent to sit in a covered vehicle without springs, which was once thought an advance in luxury on the pillion. </p><p>	The condition of the tenant-farmers and small proprietors in Germany is, we imagine, about on a par, not, certainly, in material prosperity, but in mental culture and habits, with that of the English farmers who were beginning to be thought old-fashioned nearly fifty years ago, and if we add to these the farm servants and labourers, we shall have a class approximating in its characteristics to the Bauernthum, or peasantry, described by Riehl.</p><p>	In Germany, perhaps more than in any other country, it is among the peasantry that we must look for the historical type of the national physique. In the towns this type has become so modified to express the personality of the individual, that even "family likeness" is often but faintly marked. But the peasants may still be distinguished into groups by their physical peculiarities. In one part of the country we find a longer-legged, in another a broader-shouldered race, which has inherited these peculiarities for centuries. For example, in certain districts of Hesse are seen long faces, with high foreheads, long, straight noses, and small eyes with arched eyebrows and large eyelids. On comparing these physiognomies with the sculptures in the church of St. Elizabeth, at Marburg, executed in the thirteenth century, it will be found that the same old Hessian type of face has subsisted unchanged, with this distinction only, that the sculptures represent princes and nobles, whose features then bore the stamp of their race, while that stamp is now to be found only among the peasants. A painter who wants to draw mediaeval characters with historic truth, must seek his models among the peasantry. This explains why the old German painters gave the heads of their subjects a greater uniformity of type than the painters of our day: the race had not attained to a high degree of individualization in features and expression. It indicates, too, that the cultured man acts more as an individual; the peasant, more as one of a group. Hans drives the plough, lives, and thinks just as Kunz does ; and it is this fact, that many thousands</p><p>58 The Natural History of German Life.</p><p>of men are as like each other in thoughts and habits as so many sheep or oysters, which constitutes the weight of the peasantry in the social and political scale. </p><p>	In the cultivated world each individual has his style of speaking and writing. But among the peasantry it is the race, the district, the province, that has its style; namely, its dialect, its phraseology, its proverbs and its songs, which belong alike to the entire body of the people. This provincial style of the peasant is again, like his physique, a remnant of history to which he clings with the utmost tenacity. In certain parts of Hungary, there are still descendants of German colonists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who go about the country as reapers, retaining their old Saxon songs and manners, while the more cultivated German emigrants in a very short time forget their own language, and speak Hungarian. Another remarkable case of the same kind is that of the Wends, a Sclavonic race settled in Lusatia, whose numbers amount to 200,000, living either scattered among the German population or in separate parishes. They have their own schools and churches, and are taught in the Sclavonic tongue. The Catholics among them are rigid adherents of the Pope; the Protestants. not less rigid adherents of Luther, or Doctor Luther, as they are particular in calling him-a custom which, a hundred years ago, was universal in Protestant Germany. The Wend clings tenaciously to the usages of his Church, and perhaps this may contribute not a little to the purity in which he maintains the specific characteristics of his race. German education, German law and government, service in the standing army, and many other agencies, are in antagonism to his national exclusiveness; but the wives and mothers here, as elsewhere, are a conservative influence, and the habits temporarily laid aside in the outer world are recovered by the fireside. The VVends form several stout regiments in the Saxon army; they are sought far and wide, as diligent and honest servants; and many a weakly Dresden or Leipzig child becomes thriving under the care of a VVendish nurse. In their villages they have the air and habits of genuine, sturdy peasants, and all their customs indicate that they have been, from the first, an agricultural people. For example, they have traditional modes of treating their domestic animals. Each cow has its own name, generally chosen carefully, so as to express the special qualities of the animal; and all important family events are narrated to the bees-a custom which is found also in Westphalia. Whether by the help of the bees or not, the Wend farming is especially prosperous; and when a poor Bohemian peasant has a son born to him, he binds him to the end of along pole and turns his face towards Lusatia, that he may be as lucky as the VVends who live there.</p><p>Peasants adherence to the Traditional. 59 </p><p>	The peculiarity of the peasant's language consists chiefly in his retention of historical peculiarities, which gradually disappear under the friction of cultivated circles. He prefers any proper name that may be given to a day in the calendar, rather than the abstract date, by which he very rarely reckons. In the baptismal names of his children he is guided by the old custom of the country, not at all by whim and fancy. Many old baptismal names, formerly common in Germany, would have become extinct but for their preservation among the peasantry, especially in North Germany; and so firmly have they adhered to local tradition in this matter, that it would be possible to give a sort of topographical statistics of proper names, and distinguish a district by its rustic names as we do by its Flora and Fauna. The continuous inheritance of certain favourite proper names in a family, in some districts, forces the peasant to adopt the princely custom of attaching a numeral to the name, and saying, when three generations are living at once, Hans I., II., and III.; or-in the more antique fashion-Hans the elder, the middle, and the younger. In some of our English counties there is a similar adherence to a narrow range of proper names, and as a mode of distinguishing collateral branches in the same family, you will hear of Jonathan's Bess, Thomas's Bess, and Samuel's Bess-the three Bessies being cousins.</p><p>	The peasant's adherence to the traditional has much greater inconvenience than that entailed by a paucity of proper names. In the Black Forest and in H ttenberg you will see him in the dog-days wearing a thick fur cap, because it is an historical fur cap-a cap worn by his grandfather. In the VVetterau, that peasant girl is considered the handsomest who wears the most petticoats. To go to field-labour in seven petticoats can be anything but convenient or agreeable, but it is the traditionally correct thing, and a German peasant girl would think herself as unfavourably conspicuous in an untraditional costume, as an English servant-girl would now think herself in a "linsey-woolsey" apron or a thick muslin cap. In many districts no medical advice would induce the rustic to renounce the tight leather belt with which he injures his digestive functions; you could more easily persuade him to smile on a new communal system than on the unhistorical invention of braces. In the eighteenth century, in spite of the philanthropic preachers of potatoes, the peasant for years threw his potatoes to the pigs and the dogs, before he could be persuaded to put them on his own table. However, the unwillingness of the peasant to adopt innovations has a not unreasonable foundation in the fact, that for him experiments are practical, not theoretical, and must be made with expense of money instead of brains-a fact that is not, perhaps,</p><p>60 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>sufficiently taken into account by agricultural theorists, who complain of the farmer's obstinacy. The peasant has the smallest possible faith in theoretic knowledge; he thinks it rather dangerous than otherwise, as is well indicated by a Lower Rhenish proverb-"One is never too old to learn, said an old woman; so she learned to be a witch." </p><p>	Between many villages an historical feud, once perhaps the occasion of much bloodshed, is still kept up under the milder form of an occasional round of cudgelling, and the launching of traditional nicknames. An historical feud of this kind still exists, for example, among many villages on the Rhine and more inland places in the neighbourhood. Rheinschnacke (of which the equivalent is perhaps "water-snake") is the standing term of ignominy for the inhabitant of the Rhine village, who repays it in kind by the epithet "karst" (mattock) or "kukuk" (cuckoo), according as the object of his hereditary hatred belongs to the field or the forest. If any Romeo among the "mattocks" were to marry a Juliet among the "water-snakes," there would be no lack of Tybalts and Mercutios to carry the conflict from words to blows, though neither side knows a reason for the enmity.</p><p>	A droll instance of peasant conservatism is told of a village on the Taunus, whose inhabitants, from time immemorial, had been famous for impromptu cudgelling. For this historical offence the magistrates of the district had always inflicted the equally historical punishment of shutting up the most incorrigible offenders, not in prison, but in their own pig-sty. In recent times, however, the government, wishing to correct the rudeness of these peasants, appointed an "enlightened" man as magistrate, who at once abolished the original penalty above-mentioned. But this relaxation of punishment was so far from being welcome to the villagers that they presented a petition praying that a more energetic man might be given them as a magistrate, who would have the courage to punish according to law and justice, "as had been beforetime." And the magistrate who abolished incarceration in the pig-sty could never obtain the respect of the neighbourhood. This happened no longer ago than the beginning of the present century.</p><p>	But it must not be supposed that the historical piety of the German peasant extends to anything not immediately connected with himself. He has the warmest piety towards the old tumble- down house which his grandfather built, and which nothing will induce him to improve, but towards the venerable ruins of the old castle that overlooks his village he has no piety at all, and carries off its stones to make a fence for his garden, or tears down the gothic carving of the old monastic church, which is "nothing to him," to mark off a foot path</p><p>Litigiousness of the German Peasant. 61 </p><p>through his field. It is the same with historical traditions. The peasant has them fresh in his memory, so far as they relate to himself. In districts where the peasantry are unadulterated, you discern the remnants of the feudal relations in innumerable customs and phrases, but you will ask in vain for historical traditions concerning the empire, or even concerning the particular princely house to which the peasant is subject. He can tell you what "half people and whole people" mean; in Hesse you will still hear of "four horses making a whole peasant," or of "four-day and three-day peasants;" but you will ask in vain about Charlemagne and Frederic Barbarossa. </p><p>	Riehl well observes that the feudal system, which made the peasant the bondman of his lord, was an immense benefit in a country, the greater part of which had still to be colonized,-rescued the peasant from vagabondage, and laid the foundation of persistency and endurance in future generations. If a free German peasantry belongs only to modern times, it is to his ancestor who was a serf, and even, in the earliest times, a slave, that the peasant owes the foundation of his independence, namely, his capability of a settled existence,-nay, his unreasoning persistency, which has its important function in the development of the race.</p><p>	Perhaps the very worst result of that unreasoning persistency is the peasant's inveterate habit of litigation. Every one remembers the immortal description of Dandie Dinmont's importunate application to Lawyer Pleydell to manage his "bit lawsuit," till at length Pleydell consents to help him ruin himself, on the ground that Dandie may fall into worse hands. It seems, this is a scene which has many parallels in Germany. The farmer's lawsuit is his point of honour; and he will carry it through, though he knows from the very first day that he shall get nothing by it. The litigious peasant piques himself, like Mr. Saddletree, on his knowledge of the law, and this vanity is the chief impulse to many a lawsuit. To the mind of the peasant, law presents itself as the "custom of the country," and it is his pride to be versed in all customs. Custom with him holds the place of sentiment, of theory, and in many cases of affection. Riehl justly urges the importance of simplifying law proceedings, so as to cut off this vanity at its source, and also of encouraging, by every possible means, the practice of arbitration.</p><p>	The peasant never begins his lawsuit in summer, for the same reason that he does not make love and marry in summer,-because he has no time for that sort of thing. Anything is easier to him than to move out of his habitual course, and he is attached even to his privations. Some years ago, a peasant youth, out of the</p><p>62 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>poorest and remotest region of the Westerwald, was enlisted as a recruit, at Weilburg in Nassau. The lad, having never in his life slept in a bed, when he had to get into one for the first time began to cry like a child; and he deserted twice because he could not reconcile himself to sleeping in a bed, and to the "fine" life of the barracks: he was homesick at the thought of his accustomed poverty and his thatched hut. A strong contrast, this, with the feeling of the poor in towns, who would be far enough from deserting because their condition was too much improved! The genuine peasant is never ashamed of his rank and calling; he is rather inclined to look down on every one who does not wear a smock-frock, and thinks a man who has the manners of the gentry is likely to be rather windy and unsubstantial. In some places, even in French districts, this feeling is strongly symbolized by the practice of the peasantry, on certain festival days, to dress the images of the saints in peasant's clothing. History tells us of all kinds of peasant insurrections, the object of which was to obtain relief for the peasants from some of their many oppressions; but of an effort on their part to step out of their hereditary rank and calling, to become gentry, to leave the plough and carry on the easier business of capitalists or government-functionaries, there is no example.</p><p>	The German novelists who undertake to give pictures of peasant-life, fall into the same mistake as our English novelists; they transfer their own feelings to ploughmen and woodcutters, and give them both joys and sorrows of which they know nothing. The peasant never questions the obligation of family-ties-he questions no custom,-but tender affection, as it exists amongst the refined part of mankind, is almost as foreign to him as white hands and filbert-shaped nails. That the aged father who has given up his property to his children on condition of their maintaining him for the remainder of his life, is very far from meeting with delicate attentions, is indicated by the proverb current among the peasantry-"Don't take your clothes off before you go to bed." Among rustic moral tales and parables, not one is more universal than the story of the ungrateful children, who made their grey-headed father, dependent on them for a maintenance, eat at a wooden trough, because he shook the food out of his trembling hands. Then these same ungrateful children observed one day that their own little boy was making a tiny wooden trough; and when they asked him what it was for, he answered-that his father and mother might eat out of it, when he was a man and had to keep them.</p><p>	Marriage is a very prudential affair, especially among the peasants who have the largest share of property. Politic marriages are as common among them as among princes; and</p><p>Degeneration of the Peasantry. 63 </p><p>when a peasant-heiress in Westphalia marries, her husband adopts her name, and places his own after it with the prefix geborner (n e). The girls marry young, and the rapidity with which they get old and ugly is one among the many proofs that the early years of marriage are fuller of hardships than of conjugal tenderness. "When our writers of village stories," says Riehl, "transferred their own emotional life to the peasant, they obliterated what is precisely his most predominant characteristic, namely, that with him general custom holds the place of individual feeling." </p><p>	We pay for greater emotional susceptibility too often by nervous diseases of which the peasant knows nothing. To him headache is the least of physical evils, because he thinks headwork the easiest and least indispensable of all labour. Happily, many of the younger sons in peasant families, by going to seek their living in the towns, carry their hardy nervous system to amalgamate with the over-wrought nerves of our town population, and refresh them with a little rude vigour. And a return to the habits of peasant life is the best remedy for many moral as well as physical diseases induced by perverted civilization. Riehl points to colonization as presenting the true field for this regenerative process. On the other side of the ocean, a man will have the courage to begin life again as a peasant, while at home, perhaps, opportunity as well as courage will fail him. Apropos of this subject of emigration, he remarks the striking fact, that the native shrewdness and mother-wit of the German peasant seem to forsake him entirely when he has to apply them under new circumstances, and on relations foreign to his experience. Hence it is that the German peasant who emigrates, so constantly falls a victim to unprincipled adventurers in the preliminaries to emigration; but if once he gets his foot on the American soil, he exhibits all the first-rate qualities of an agricultural colonist; and among all German emigrants, the peasant class are the most successful.</p><p>	But many disintegrating forces have been at work on the peasant character, and degeneration is unhappily going on at a greater pace than development. In the wine districts especially, the inability of the small proprietors to bear up under the vicissitudes of the market, or to ensure a high quality of wine by running the risks of a late vintage, and the competition of beer and cider with the inferior wines, have tended to produce that uncertainty of gain which, with the peasant, is the inevitable cause of demoralization. The small peasant proprietors are not a new class in Germany, but many of the evils of their position are new. They are more dependent on ready money than formerly; thus, where a peasant used to get his wood for</p><p>64 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>building and firing from the common forest, he has now to pay for it with hard cash; he used to thatch his own house, with the help perhaps of a neighbour, but now he pays a man to do it for him; he used to pay taxes in kind, he now pays them in money. The chances of the market have to be discounted, and the peasant falls into the hands of money-lenders. Here is one of the cases in which social policy clashes with a purely economical policy. </p><p>	Political vicissitudes have added their influence to that of economical changes in disturbing that dim instinct, that reverence for traditional custom, which is the peasant's principle of action. He is in the midst of novelties for which he knows no reason-changes in political geography, changes of the government to which he owes fealty, changes in bureaucratic management and police regulations. He finds himself in a new element before an apparatus for breathing in it is developed in him. His only knowledge of modern history is in some of its results-for instance, that he has to pay heavier taxes from year to year. His chief idea of a government is of a power that raises his taxes, opposes his harmless customs, and torments him with new formalities. The source of all this is the false system of "enlightening" the peasant which has been adopted by the bureaucratic governments. A system which disregards the traditions and hereditary attachments of the peasant, and appeals only to a logical understanding which is not yet developed in him, is simply disintegrating and ruinous to the peasant character. The interference with the communal regulations has been of this fatal character. Instead of endeavouring to promote to the utmost the healthy life of the Commune, as an organism the conditions of which are bound up with the historical characteristics of the peasant, the bureaucratic plan of government is bent on improvement by its patent machinery of state-appointed functionaries and off-hand regulations in accordance with modern enlightenment. The spirit of communal exclusiveness-the resistance to the indiscriminate establishment of strangers, is an intense traditional feeling in the peasant. "This gallows is for us and our children," is the typical motto of this spirit. But such exclusiveness is highly irrational and repugnant to modern liberalism; therefore a bureaucratic government at once opposes it, and encourages to the utmost the introduction of new inhabitants in the provincial communes. Instead of allowing the peasants to manage their own affairs, and, if they happen to believe that five and four make eleven, to unlearn the prejudice by their own experience in calculation, so that they may gradually understand processes, and not merely see results, bureaucracy comes with its "Ready Reckoner" and works all the</p><p>Animus of Peasant Insurrections. 65 </p><p>peasant's sums for him-the surest way of maintaining him in his stupidity, however it may shake his prejudice. Another questionable plan for elevating the peasant, is the supposed elevation of the clerical character by preventing the clergyman from cultivating more than a trifling part of the land attached to his benefice; that he may be as much as possible of a scientific theologian, and as little as possible of a peasant. In this, Riehl observes, lies one great source of weakness to the Protestant Church as compared with the Catholic, which finds the great majority of its priests among the lower orders; and we have had the opportunity of making an analogous comparison in England, where many of us can remember country districts in which the great mass of the people were christianized by illiterate Methodist and Independent ministers while the influence of the parish clergyman among the poor did not extend much beyond a few old women in scarlet cloaks, and a few exceptional church-going labourers.</p><p>	Bearing in mind the general characteristics of the German peasant, it is easy to understand his relation to the revolutionary ideas and revolutionary movements of modern times. The peasant, in Germany as elsewhere, is a born grumbler. He has always plenty of grievances in his pocket, but he does not generalize those grievances; he does not complain of "government" or "society," probably because he has good reason to complain of the burgomaster. When a few sparks from the first French Revolution fell among the German peasantry, and in certain villages of Saxony the country people assembled together to write down their demands, there was no glimpse in their petition of the "universal rights of man," but simply of their own particular affairs as Saxon peasants. Again, after the July revolution of 1830, there were many insignificant peasant insurrections; but the object of almost all was the removal of local grievances. Toll-houses were pulled down; stamped paper was destroyed; in some places there was a persecution of wild boars, in others, of that plentiful tame animal, the German Rath, or Councillor who is never called into council. But in 1848, it seemed as if the movements of the peasants had taken a new character; in the small western states of Germany, it seemed as if the whole class of peasantry was in insurrection. But in fact, the peasant did not know the meaning of the part he was playing. He had heard that everything was being set right in the towns, and that wonderful things were happening there, so he tied up his bundle and set off. Without any distinct object or resolution, the country people presented themselves on the scene of commotion, and were warmly received by the party leaders. But, seen from the windows of ducal palaces and minis-</p><p>[VOL LXVI. No. CXXIX.]-NEW SERIES, Vol. X. No. I. F </p><p>66 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>terial hotels, these swarms of peasants had quite another aspect, and it was imagined that they had a common plan of co-operation. This, however, the peasants have never had. Systematic co-operation implies general conceptions, and a provisional subordination of egoism, to which even the artisans of towns have rarely shown themselves equal, and which are as foreign to the mind of the peasant as logarithms or the doctrine of chemical proportions. And the revolutionary fervour of the peasant was soon cooled. The old mistrust of the towns was reawakened on the spot. The Tyrolese peasants saw no great good in the freedom of the press and the constitution, because these changes "seemed to please the gentry so much." Peasants who had given their voices stormily for a German parliament, asked afterwards, with a doubtful look, whether it were to consist of infantry or cavalry. When royal domains were declared the property of the State, the peasants in some small principalities rejoiced over this, because they interpreted it to mean that every one would have his share in them, after the manner of the old common and forest rights. </p><p>	The very practical views of the peasants, with regard to the demands of the people, were in amusing contrast with the abstract theorizing of the educated townsmen. The peasant continually withheld all State payments until he saw how matters would turn out, and was disposed to reckon up the solid benefit, in the form of land or money, that might come to him from the changes obtained. While the townsman was heating his brains about representation on the broadest basis, the peasant asked if the relation between tenant and landlord would continue as before, and whether the removal of the "feudal obligations" meant that the farmer should become owner of the land? It is in the same naive way that Communism is interpreted by the German peasantry. The wide spread among them of communistic doctrines, the eagerness with which they listened to a plan for the partition of property, seemed to countenance the notion, that it was a delusion to suppose the peasant would be secured from this intoxication by his love of secure possession and peaceful earnings. But, in fact, the peasant contemplated "partition" by the light of an historical reminiscence rather than of novel theory. The golden age, in the imagination of the peasant, was the time when every member of the commune had a right to as much wood from the forest as would enable him, to sell some, after using what he wanted in firing,-in which the communal possessions were so profitable that, instead of his having to pay rates at the end of the year, each member of the commune was something in pocket. Hence the peasants in general understood by "partition," that the State lands, especially the forests,</p><p>Peasant's Notion of Representation. 67 </p><p>would be divided among the communes, and that, by some political legerdemain or other, everybody would have free fire-wood, free grazing for his cattle, and over and above that, a piece of gold without working for it. That he should give up a single clod of his own to further the general "partition," had never entered the mind of the peasant communist, and the perception that this was an essential preliminary to "partition," was often a sufficient cure for his Communism. </p><p>	In villages lying in the neighbourhood of large towns, however, where the circumstances of the peasantry are very different, quite another interpretation of Communism is prevalent. Here the peasant is generally sunk to the position of the proletaire, living from hand to mouth; he has nothing to lose, but everything to gain by "partition." The coarse nature of the peasant has here been corrupted into bestiality by the disturbance of his instincts, while he is as yet incapable of principles; and in this type of the degenerate peasant is seen the worst example of ignorance intoxicated by theory. A significant hint as to the interpretation the peasants put on revolutionary theories, may be drawn from the way they employed the few weeks in which their movements were unchecked. They felled the forest trees and shot the game, they withheld taxes; they shook off the imaginary or real burdens imposed on them by their mediatized princes, by presenting their "demands" in a very rough way before the ducal or princely "Schloss;" they set their faces against the bureaucratic management of the communes, deposed the government functionaries who had been placed over them as burgomasters and magistrates, and abolished the whole bureaucratic system of procedure, simply by taking no notice of its regulations, and recurring to some tradition-some old order or disorder of things. In all this it is clear that they were animated not in the least by the spirit of modern revolution, but by a purely narrow and personal impulse towards reaction.</p><p>	The idea of constitutional government lies quite beyond the range of the German peasant's conceptions. His only notion of representation is that of a representation of ranks-of classes; his only notion of a deputy is of one who takes care, not of the national welfare, but of the interests of his own order. Herein lay the great mistake of the democratic party, in common with the bureaucratic governments, that they entirely omitted the peculiar character of the peasant from their political calculations. They talked of the "people," and forget that the peasants were included in the term. Only a baseless misconception of the peasant's character could induce the supposition that he would feel the slightest enthusiasm about the principles involved in the</p><p>68 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>re-constitution of the Empire, or even about that re-constitution itself. He has no zeal for a written law, as such, but only so far as it takes the form of a living law-a tradition. It was the external authority which the revolutionary party had won in Baden that attracted the peasants into a participation in the struggle. </p><p>	Such, Riehl tells us, are the general characteristics of the German peasantry-characteristics which subsist amidst a wide variety of circumstances. In Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and B1andenburg, the peasant lives on extensive estates, in Westphalia he lives in large isolated homesteads; in the Westerwald and in Sauerland, in little groups of villages and hamlets, on the Rhine, land is for the most part parcelled out among small proprietors, who live together in large villages. Then, of course, the diversified physical geography of Germany gives rise to equally diversified methods of land-culture; and out of these various circumstances grow numerous specific differences in manner and character. But the generic character of the German peasant is everywhere the same: in the clean mountain hamlet and in the dirty fishing village on the coast; in the plains of North Germany and in the backwoods of America. "Everywhere he has the same historical character-everywhere custom is his supreme law. Where religion and patriotism are still a naive instinct-are still a sacred custom, there begins the class of the German Peasantry."</p><p>	Our readers will perhaps already have gathered from the foregoing portrait of the German peasant, that Riehl is not a man who looks at objects through the spectacles either of the doctrinaire or the dreamer; and they will be ready to believe what he tells us in his Preface, namely, that years ago he began his wanderings over the hills and plains of Germany for the sake of obtaining, in immediate intercourse with the people, that completion of his historical, political, and economical studies which he was unable to find in books. He began his investigations with no party prepossessions, and his present views were evolved entirely from his own gradually amassed observations. He was, first of all, a pedestrian, and only in the second place a political author. The views at which he has arrived by this inductive process, he sums up in the term--social-political -conservatism; but his conservatism is, we conceive, of a thoroughly philosophical kind. He sees in European society incarnate history, and any attempt to disengage it from its historical elements must, he believes, be simply destructive of social vitality.*</p><p>* Throughout this article, in our statement of Riehl's opinions, we must be understood not as quoting Riehl, but as interpreting and illustrating him. </p><p>Society incarnate History. 69 </p><p>What has grown up historically can only die out historically, by the gradual operation of necessary laws. The external conditions which society has inherited from the past are but the manifestation of inherited internal conditions in the human beings who compose it; the internal conditions and the external are related to each other as the organism and its medium, and development can take place only by the gradual consentaneous development of both. Take the familiar example of attempts to abolish titles, which have been about as effective as the process of cutting off poppy-heads in a corn-field. Jedem Menschen, says Riehl, ist sein Zopf angeboren, warum soll denn der sociale Sprachgebrauch nicht auch seinen Zopf haben?--which we may render-"as long as snobbism runs in the blood, why should it not run in our speech?" As a necessary preliminary to a purely rational society, you must obtain purely rational men, free from the sweet and bitter prejudices of hereditary affection and antipathy; which is as easy as to get running streams without springs, or the leafy shade of the forest Without the secular growth of trunk and branch. </p><p>	The historical conditions of society may be compared with those of language. It must be admitted that the language of cultivated nations is in anything but a rational state; the great sections of the civilized world are only approximatively intelligible to each other, and even that, only at the cost of long study; one word stands for many things, and many words for one thing; the subtle shades of meaning, and still subtler echoes of association, make language an instrument which scarcely anything short of genius can wield with definiteness and certainty. Suppose, then, that the effort which has been again and again made to construct a universal language on a rational basis has at length succeeded, and that you have a language which has no uncertainty, no whims of idiom, no cumbrous forms, no fitful shimmer of many-hued significance, no hoary archaisms "familiar with forgotten years"-a patent de-odorized and non-resonant language, which effects the purpose of communication as perfectly and rapidly as algebraic signs. Your language may be a perfect medium of expression to science, but will never express life, which is a great deal more than science. With the anomalies and inconveniences of historical language, you will have parted with its music and its passion, with its vital qualities as an expression of individual character, with its subtle capabilities of wit, with everything that gives it power over the imagination; and the next step in simplification will be the invention of a talking watch, which will achieve the utmost facility and dispatch in the communication of ideas by a graduated adjustment of ticks, to be represented in writing by a corresponding arrangement of</p><p>70 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>dots. A melancholy "language of the future!" The sensory and motor nerves that run in the same sheath, are scarcely bound together by a more necessary and delicate union than that which binds men's affections, imagination, wit, and humour, with the subtle ramifications of historical language. Language must be left to grow in precision, completeness, and unity, as minds grow in clearness, comprehensiveness, and sympathy. And there is an analogous relation between the moral tendencies of men and the social conditions they have inherited. The nature of European men has its roots intertwined with the past, and can only be developed by allowing those roots to remain undisturbed while the process of development is going on, until that perfect ripeness of the seed which carries with it a life independent of the root. This vital connexion with the past is much more vividly felt on the Continent than in England, where we have to recal it by an effort of memory and reflection; for though our English life is in its core intensely traditional, Protestantism and commerce have modernized the face of the land and the aspects of society in a far greater degree than in any continental country:- </p><p>	"Abroad," says Ruskin, "a building of the eighth or tenth century stands ruinous in the open street; the children play round it, the peasants heap their corn in it, the buildings of yesterday nestle about it, and fit their new stones in its rents, and tremble in sympathy as it trembles. No one wonders at it, or thinks of it as separate, and of another time; we feel the ancient world to be a real thing, and one with the new; antiquity is no dream; it is rather the children playing about the old stones that are the dream. But all is continuous; and the words "from generation to generation," understandable here."</p><p>	This conception of European society as incarnate history, is the fundamental idea of Riehl's books. After the notable failure of revolutionary attempts conducted from the point of view of abstract democratic and socialistic theories, after the practical demonstration of the evils resulting from a bureaucratic system which governs by an undiscriminating, dead mechanism, Riehl wishes to urge on the consideration of his countrymen, a social policy founded on the special study of the people as they are-on the natural history of the various social ranks. He thinks it wise to pause a little from theorizing, and see what is the material actually present for theory to work upon. It is the glory of the Socialists-in contrast with the democratic doctrinaires who have been too much occupied with the general idea of "the people" to inquire particularly into the actual life of the people-that they have thrown themselves with enthusiastic zeal into the study at least of one social group, namely, the factory operatives; and here lies the secret of their partial success. But unfortunately, they have</p><p>The General and the Special in Social Science. 71 </p><p>made this special study of a single fragment of society the basis of a theory which quietly substitutes for the small group of Parisian proletaires or English factory-workers, the society of all Europe-nay, of the whole world. And in this way they have lost the best fruit of their investigations. For, says Riehl, the more deeply we penetrate into the knowledge of society in its details, the more thoroughly we shall be convinced that a universal social policy has no validity except on paper, and can never be carried into successful practice. The conditions of German society are altogether different from those of French, of English, or of Italian society; and to apply the same social theory to these nations indiscriminately, is about as wise a procedure as Triptolemus Yellowley's application of the agricultural directions in Virgil's "Georgics" to his farm in the Shetland Isles.</p><p>	It is the clear and strong light in which Riehl places this important position, that in our opinion constitutes the suggestive value of his books for foreign as well as German readers. It has not been sufficiently insisted on, that in the various branches of Social Science there is an advance from the general to the special, from the simple to the complex, analogous with that which is found in the series of the sciences, from Mathematics to Biology. To the laws of quantity comprised in Mathematics and Physics are superadded, in Chemistry, laws of quality; to these again are added, in Biology, laws of life ; and lastly, the conditions of life in general, branch out into its special conditions, or Natural History, on the one hand, and into its abnormal conditions, or Pathology, on the other. And in this series or ramification of the sciences, the more general science will not suffice to solve the problems of the more special. Chemistry embraces phenomena which are not explicable by Physics; Biology embraces phenomena which are not explicable by Chemistry; and no biological generalization will enable us to predict the infinite specialities produced by the complexity of vital conditions. So Social Science, while it has departments which in their fundamental generality correspond to mathematics and physics, namely, those grand and simple generalizations which trace out the inevitable march of the human race as a whole, and, as a ramification of these, the laws of economical science, has also, in the departments of government and jurisprudence, which embrace the conditions of social life in all their complexity, what may be called its Biology, carrying us on to innumerable special phenomena which outlie the sphere of science, and belong to Natural History. And just as the most thorough acquaintance with physics, or chemistry, or general physiology will not enable you at once to establish the balance of life in your private Vivarium, so that your particular society of zoophytes, molluscs, and echinoderms may feel them-</p><p>72 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>selves, as the Germans say, at ease in their skin; so the most complete equipment of theory will not enable a statesman or a political and social reformer to adjust his measures wisely, in the absence of a special acquaintance with the section of society for which he legislates, with the peculiar characteristics of the nation, the province, the class whose well-being he has to consult. In other words, a wise social policy must be based not simply on abstract social science, but on the Natural History of social bodies. </p><p>	Riehl's books are not dedicated merely to the argumentative maintenance of this or of any other position; they are intended chiefly as a contribution to that knowledge of the German people on the importance of which he insists. He is less occupied with purging his own conclusions than with impressing on his readers the facts which have led him to those conclusions. In the volume entitled Land and Leute, which, though published last, is properly an introduction to the volume entitled Die B rgerliche Gesellschaft, he considers the German people in their physical-geographical relations; he compares the natural divisions of the race, as determined by land and climate, and social traditions, with the artificial divisions which are based on diplomacy; and he traces the genesis and influences of what we may call the ecclesiastical geography of Germany-its partition between Catholicism and Protestantism. He shows that the ordinary antithesis of North and South Germany represents no real ethnographical distinction, and that the natural divisions of Germany, founded on its physical geography, are threefold; namely, the low plains, the middle mountain region, and the high mountain region, or Lower, Middle, and Upper Germany; and on this primary natural division all the other broad ethnographical distinctions of Germany will be found to rest. The plains of North or Lower Germany include all the seaboard the nation possesses; and this, together with the fact that they are traversed to the depth of 600 miles by navigable rivers, makes them the natural seat of a trading race. Quite different is the geographical character of Middle Germany. While the northern plains are marked off into great divisions, by such rivers as the Lower Rhine, the Weser, and the Oder, running almost in parallel lines, this central region is cut up like a mosaic by the capricious lines of valleys and rivers. Here is the region in which you find those famous roofs from which the rain-water runs towards two different seas, and the mountain-tops from which you may look into eight or ten German States. The abundance of water-power and the presence of extensive coal-mines allow of a very diversified industrial development in Middle Germany. In Upper Germany, or the high mountain region,</p><p>Threefold Division of Germany. 73 </p><p>we find the same symmetry in the lines of the rivers as in the north; almost all the great Alpine streams flow parallel with the Danube. But the majority of these rivers are neither navigable nor available for industrial objects, and instead of serving for communication, they shut off one great tract from another. The slow development, the simple peasant life of many districts is here determined by the mountain and the river. In the southeast, however, industrial activity spreads through Bohemia towards Austria, and forms a sort of balance to the industrial districts of the Lower Rhine. Of course, the boundaries of these three regions cannot be very strictly defined; but an approximation to the limits of Middle Germany may be obtained by regarding it as a triangle, of which one angle lies in Silesia, another in Aix-la-Chapelle, and a third at Lake Constance. This triple division corresponds with the broad distinctions of climate. In the northern plains the atmosphere is damp and heavy; in the southern mountain region it is dry and rare, and there are abrupt changes of temperature, sharp contrasts between the seasons, and devastating storms; but in both these zones men are hardened by conflict with the roughnesses of the climate. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, there is little of this struggle; the seasons are more equable, and the mild, soft air of the valleys tends to make the inhabitants luxurious and sensitive to hardships. It is only in exceptional mountain districts that one is here reminded of the rough, bracing air on the heights of Southern Germany. It is a curious fact that, as the air becomes gradually lighter and rarer from the North German coast towards Upper Germany, the average of suicides regularly decreases. Mecklenburg has the highest number, then Prussia, while the fewest suicides occur in Bavaria and Austria. Both the northern and southern regions have still a large extent of waste lands, downs, morasses, and heaths; and to these are added, in the south, abundance of snow-fields and naked rock; while in Middle Germany culture has almost overspread the face of the land, and there are no large tracts of waste. There is the same proportion in the distribution of forests. Again, in the north we see a monotonous continuity of wheat-fields, potato-grounds, meadow lands, and vast heaths, and there is the same uniformity of culture over large surfaces in the southern table-lands and the Alpine pastures. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, there is a perpetual variety of crops within a short space; the diversity of land surface and the corresponding variety in the species of plants are an invitation to the splitting up of estates, and this again encourages to the utmost the motley character of the cultivation. </p><p>	According to this threefold division, it appears that there are</p><p>74 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>certain features common to North and South Germany in which they differ from Central Germany, and the nature of this difference Riehl indicates by distinguishing the former as Centralized Land and the latter as Individualized Land; a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact that North and South Germany possess the great lines of railway which are the medium for the traffic of the world, while Middle Germany is far richer in lines for local communication, and possesses the greatest length of railway within the smallest space. Disregarding superficialities, the East Frieslanders, the Schleswig-Holsteiners, the Mecklenburghers, and the Pomeranians are much more nearly allied to the old Bavarians, the Tyrolese, and the Styrians, than any of these are allied to the Saxons, the Thuringians, or the Rhine-landers. Both in North and South Germany original races are still found in large masses, and popular dialects are spoken; you still find there thoroughly peasant districts, thorough villages, and also, at great intervals, thorough cities; you still find there a sense of rank. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, the original races are fused together or sprinkled hither and thither; the peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or confused; there is no very strict line of demarcation between the country and the town population, hundreds of small towns and large villages being hardly distinguishable in their characteristics; and the sense of rank, as part of the organic structure of society, is almost extinguished. Again, both in the north and south there is still a strong ecclesiastical spirit in the people, and the Pomeranian sees Antichrist in the Pope as clearly as the Tyrolese sees him in Doctor Luther; while in Middle Germany the confessions are mingled, they exist peaceably side by side in very narrow space, and tolerance or indifference has spread itself widely even in the popular mind. And the analogy, or rather the causal relation, between the physical geography of the three regions and the development of the population goes still further:</p><p>	"For," observes Riehl, "the striking connexion which has been pointed out between the local geological formations in Germany and the revolutionary disposition of the people has more than a metaphorical significance. Where the primeval physical revolutions of the globe have been the wildest in their effects, and the most multiform strata have been tossed together or thrown one upon the other, it is a very intelligible consequence that on a land surface thus broken up, the population should sooner develop itself into small communities, and that the more intense life generated in these smaller communities should become the most favourable nidus for the reception of modern culture, and with this a susceptibility for its revolutionary ideas; while a people settled in a region where its groups are spread over a large space will persist much more obstinately in the retention of it's original character. The people Of Middle Germany have none of that exclusive one-sided</p><p>The Four Estates. 75 </p><p>ness which determines the peculiar genius of great national groups, just as this one-sidedness or uniformity is wanting to the geological and geographical character of their land." </p><p>	This ethnographical outline Biehl fills up with special and typical descriptions, and then makes it the starting-point for a criticism of the actual political condition of Germany. The volume is full of vivid pictures, as well as penetrating glances into the maladies and tendencies of modern society. It would be fascinating as literature, if it were not important for its facts and philosophy. But we can only commend it to our readers, and pass on to the volume entitled Die B rgerliche Gesellschaft, from which we have drawn our sketch of the German peasantry. Here Riehl gives us a series of studies in that natural history of the people, which he regards as the proper basis of social policy. He holds that, in European society, there are three natural ranks or estates the hereditary landed aristocracy, the citizens or commercial class, and the peasantry or agricultural class. By natural ranks he means ranks which have their roots deep in the historical structure of society, and are still, in the present, showing vitality above ground, he means those great social groups which are not only distinguished externally by their vocation, but essentially by their mental character, their habits, their mode of life,-by the principle they represent in the historical development of society. In his conception of the "Fourth Estate" he differs from the usual interpretation, according to which it is simply equivalent to the Proletariat, or those who are dependent on daily wages, whose only capital is their skill or bodily strength-factory operatives, artisans, agricultural labourers, to whom might be added, especially in Germany, the day-labourers with the quill, the literary proletariat. This, Riehl observes, is a valid basis of economical classification, but not of social classification. In his view, the Fourth Estate is a stratum produced by the perpetual abrasion of the other great social groups; it is the sign and result of the decomposition which is commencing in the organic constitution of society. Its elements are derived alike from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, and the peasantry. It assembles under its banner the deserters of historical society, and forms them into a terrible army, which is only just awaking to the consciousness of its corporate power. The tendency of this Fourth Estate, by the very process of its formation, is to do away with the distinctive historical character of the other estates, and to resolve their peculiar rank and vocation into a uniform social relation founded on an abstract conception of society. According to Riehl's classification, the day-labourers, whom the political economist designates as the Fourth Estate, belong partly to the peasantry or agricultural class and partly to the citizens or commercial class.</p><p>76 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>	Riehl considers, in the first place, the peasantry and aristocracy as the "Forces of social persistence," and, in the second, the bourgeoisie and the "fourth estate" as the "Forces of social movement."</p><p>	The aristocracy, he observes, is the only one among these four groups which is denied by others besides Socialists to have any natural basis as a separate rank. It is admitted that there was once an aristocracy which had an intrinsic ground of existence, but now, it is alleged, this is an historical fossil, an antiquarian relic, venerable because grey with age. In what, it is asked, can consist the peculiar vocation of the aristocracy, since it has no longer the monopoly of the land, of the higher military functions, and of government offices, and since the service of the court has no longer any political importance? To this Riehl replies that in great revolutionary crises, the "men of progress: have more than once "abolished" the aristocracy. But remarkably enough, the aristocracy has always re-appeared. This measure of abolition showed that the nobility were no longer regarded as a real class, for to abolish a real class would be an absurdity. It is quite possible to contemplate a voluntary breaking-up of the peasant or citizen class in the socialistic sense, but no man in his senses would think of straightway "abolishing" citizens and peasants. The aristocracy, then, was regarded as a sort of cancer, or excrescence of society. Nevertheless, not only has it been found impossible to annihilate an hereditary nobility by decree; but also, the aristocracy of the eighteenth century outlived even the self-destructive acts of its own perversity. A life which was entirely without object, entirely destitute of functions, would not, says Riehl, be so persistent. He has an acute criticism of those who conduct a polemic against the idea of an hereditary aristocracy while they are proposing an "aristocracy of talent," which after all is based on the principle of inheritance. The Socialists are, therefore, only consistent in declaring against an aristocracy of talent. "But when they have turned the world into a great Foundling Hospital, they will still be unable to eradicate the privileges of birth." We must not follow him in his criticism, however; nor can we afford to do more than mention hastily his interesting sketch of the mediaeval aristocracy, and his admonition to the German aristocracy of the present day, that the vitality of their class is not to be sustained by romantic attempts to revive medieaval forms and sentiments, but only by the exercise of functions as real and salutary for actual society as those of the mediaeval aristocracy were for the feudal age. "In modern society the divisions of rank indicate division of labour, according to that distribution of functions in the social organism which the historical constitution of society has deter-</p><p>What is a Philister? 77 </p><p>mined. In this way the principle of differentiation and the principle of unity are identical." </p><p>	The elaborate study of the German bourgeoisie, which forms the next division of the volume, must be passed over, but we may pause a moment to note Riehl's definition of the social Philister (Philistine), an epithet for which we have no equivalent, not at all, however, for want of the object it represents. Most people, who read a little German, know that the epithet Philister originated in the Burschen-leben, or Student-life of Germany, and that the antithesis of Bursch and Philister was equivalent to the antithesis of "gown" and "town;" but since the word has passed into ordinary language, it has assumed several shades of significance which have not yet been merged in a single, absolute meaning; and one of the questions which an English visitor in Germany will probably take an opportunity of asking is, "What is the strict meaning of the word Philister?" Riehl's answer is, that the Philister is one who is indifferent to all social interests, all public life, as distinguished from selfish and private interests; he has no sympathy with political and social events except as they affect his own comfort and prosperity, as they offer him material for amusement or opportunity for gratifying his vanity. He has no social or political creed, but is always of the opinion which is most convenient for the moment. He is always in the majority, and is the main element of unreason and stupidity in the judgment of a "discerning public." It seems presumptuous in us to dispute Riehl's interpretation of a German word, but we must think that, in literature, the epithet Philister has usually a wider meaning than this-includes his definition and something more. We imagine the Philister is the personification of the spirit which judges everything from a lower point of view than the subject demands-which judges the affairs of the parish from the egotistic or purely personal point of view-which judges the affairs of the nation from the parochial point of view, and does not hesitate to measure the merits of the universe from the human point of view. At least, this must surely be the spirit to which Goethe alludes in a passage cited by Riehl himself, Where he says that the Germans need not be ashamed of erecting a monument to him as well as to Blucher; for if Blucher had freed them from the French, he (Goethe) had freed them from the nets of the Philister:-</p><p>	"Ihr mogt mir immer ungescheut</p><p>	Gleich Bluchern Denkmal setzen!</p><p>	Von Franzosen hat er euch befreit,</p><p>	Ich von Philister-netzen."</p><p>Goethe could hardly claim to be the apostle of public spirit; but he is eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point </p><p>78 The Natural History of German Life. </p><p>of observation, so that we may see things in their relative proportions. </p><p>	The most interesting chapters in the description of the "Fourth Estate," which concludes the volume, are those on the "Aristocratic Proletariat" and the "Intellectual Proletariat." The Fourth Estate in Germany, says Riehl, has its centre of gravity not, as in England and France, in the day labourers and factory operatives, and still less in the degenerate peasantry. In Germany, the educated proletariat is the leaven that sets the mass in fermentation; the dangerous classes there go about, not in blouses, but in frock-coats; they begin with the impoverished prince and end in the hungriest litterateur. The custom that all the sons of a nobleman shall inherit their father's title, necessarily goes on multiplying that class of aristocrats who are not only without function but without adequate provision, and who shrink from entering the ranks of the citizens by adopting some honest calling. The younger son of a prince, says Riehl, is usually obliged to remain without any vocation; and however zealously he may study music, painting, literature, or science, he can never be a regular musician, painter, or man of science; his pursuit will be called a "passion," not a "calling," and to the end of his days he remains a dilettante. "But the ardent pursuit of a fixed practical calling can alone satisfy the active man." Direct legislation cannot remedy this evil. The inheritance of titles by younger sons is the universal custom, and custom is stronger than law. But if all government preference for the "aristocratic proletariat" were withdrawn, the sensible men among them would prefer emigration, or the pursuit of some profession, to the hungry distinction of a title without rents. The intellectual proletaires Riehl calls the "church militant" of the Fourth Estate in Germany. In no other country are they so numerous; in no other country is the trade in material and industrial capital so far exceeded by the wholesale and retail trade, the traffic and the usury, in the intellectual capital of the nation. Germany yields more intellectual produce than it can use and pay for.</p><p>	"This over-production, which is not transient but permanent, nay, is constantly on the increase, evidences a diseased state of the national industry, a perverted application of industrial powers, and is afar more pungent satire on the national condition than all the poverty of operatives and peasants. . . . Other nations need not envy us the preponderance of the intellectual proletariat over the proletaires of manual labour. For man more easily becomes diseased from over-study than from the labour of the hands; and it is precisely in the intellectual proletariat that there are the most dangerous seeds of</p><p>The Nature of Riehl's Conservatism. 79 </p><p>disease. This is the group in which the opposition between earnings and wants, between the ideal social position and the real, is the most hopelessly irreconcilable." </p><p>	We must unwillingly leave our readers to make acquaintance for themselves with the graphic details with which Riehl follows up this general statement; but before quitting these admirable volumes, let us say, lest our inevitable omissions should have left room for a different cOnclusion, that Riehl's conservatism is not in the least tinged with the partisanship of a class, with a poetic fanaticism for the past, or with the prejudice of a mind incapable of discerning the grander evolution of things to which all social forms are but temporarily subservient. It is the conservatism of a clear-eyed, practical, but withal large-minded man-a little caustic, perhaps, now and then in his epigrams on democratic doctrinaires who have their nostrum for all political and social diseases, and on communistic theories which he regards as "the despair of the individual in his own manhood, reduced to a system," but nevertheless able and willing to do justice to the elements of fact and reason in every shade of opinion and every form of effort. He 1s as far as possible from the folly of supposing that the sun will go backward on the dial, because we put the hands of our clock backward; he only contends against the opposite folly of decreeing that it shall be mid-day, while in fact the sun is only just touching the mountain-tops, and all along the valley men are stumbling in the twilight.</p><p>THE LOVER'S SEAT. </p><p>AUGUST 2, 1856.]  THE LEADER.  735</p><p>Literature.</p><p>Critics are not the legislators, but the judges and police of literature. They do not make laws-they interpret and try to enforce them.-Edinburgh Review. </p><p>WHEN a Basque woman becomes a happy mother, the husband takes to his bed, nurses the baby, and receives the visits of friends. The wife gets up, and occupies herself with household duties. This is a reversal of the "natural order of things," forcing the husband to endure Mrs. GAMP (we scorn to allude to all that is implied in "the baby!") and depriving the mother of her natural right to gossip, and pity, and comparison of notes with other happy mothers, all of whom have "experiences" to relate; it is an injury to both man and woman, and is a curious illustration of that utter servitude in which woman formerly lived, and from which, even in Europe, she has not wholly emerged. In many points of moral and social philosophy we may learn a lesson from animals, and, above all, in family arrangements. Yet even animals will get corrupted by civilization. Pet dogs are not good mothers; and we once had a pet dog, whose natural sense of the fitness of things was so perverted, that when his friend, the white cat, had kittens, he did what the Basque husbands do, turned her out of bed, settled himself there, and nursing the kittens, sat in receipt of our visits and admiration. Pussy looked on wondering. </p><p>	We learned the fact about Basque husbands from the delightful Souvenirs d'un Naturaliste, by M. QUATREFAGES,of which we observe a translation announced by Messrs. LONGMAN. It is a book which will doubtless be very popular, now that Natural History is becoming "the rage." One of the most potent causes of this new interest in Natural History, especially of the simpler organisms, is the cheapness of Microscopes, formerly so expensive, when not inferior. The startling revelations of the Microscope, aided by the possibility of even slender purses affording the purchase of one, have given a wide-spread impetus to study. It is no longer the professional Physiologist or Zoologist who occupies himself with the fascinating pursuit: hundreds of amateurs every year join in it.</p><p>	At once as an indication of the increased ardour, and as a means of fostering it, we must regard the existence of the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, edited by Dr. LANKESTER and Prof. BUSK (recently appointed to fill Prof. OWEN's place at the College of Surgeons). This journal, which includes the "Transactions of the Microscopical Society of London," is valuable, both for the memoirs which it publishes, well illustrated, and for the means it affords of bringing together the results of various observations which, too small to be published separately, here find a proper corner. Among the papers of the present number interesting even to those who never looked through an object-glass, is one by the Rev. J. B. DENNIS "On the Existence of Mammifers anterior to the Deposition of the Lias." 'Where all is marvellous, it seems idle to mark out any one point for special wonder, and with the Revelations of the Microscope this is the case. Each point in its turn excites our Oh! and thus we run the round of exclamatory enthusiasm. The reader will not refuse his gasp, when he learns how the Microscope can carry the mind back into illimitable ages, with a certainty even greater than that the Telescope can carry the mind forward into illimitable spaces. Mites that we seem, crawling on the earth's crust, we can take up a portion of that crust no bigger than a threepenny piece, and from it read a striking chapter of the earth's history, thousands upon millions of years gone by. Nay, here is an admirable clerus, giving to noble science the hours which might have been wasted on ignoble polemics, who from microscopic inspection of bones not only proves the existence of mammalia at a period when what we called the Lias formation had not been deposited, but suspects that he has discovered a law of osteological development which will be very important, if confirmed. Mr. DENNIS thinks that in animals which have the power of springing, the bones are characterized by a preponderance of pointed oval lacunae; and it is curious in this respect to compare the microscopic structure of the tiger's femur with that of the kangaroo, or the frog's tibia with that of the newt. The toad agrees very nearly with the frog in this matter, except that the lacunae are longer, which Mr. DENNIS has noticed in climbing animals; but the newt is quite unlike both. The oval lacunae are present in birds; and the ulna of the flying opossum is very similar to that of birds, though still retaining its mammalian character. Curiously enough the only bird in Mr.</p><p>QUEKETT's book which has not similar lacunae is the parrot, a bird that never springs. Mr. DENNIS multiplies examples, but it seems to us that instead of seeking fresh examples of a direct kind, he should seek those far more conclusive of a negative kind-he should examine birds and animals which do not spring, and see if the absence of oval lacunae is equally constant in them. When once the general fact is discovered, the mathematician will not be long before he calculates the effect upon the strength produced by difference of shape in the lacunae. </p><p>	Another paper on the "Structure of Oscillatoriae," by Dr. F. D'ALQUEN, is also interesting, and concludes with some excellent remarks on the impossibility of separating the purely vegetable from the purely animal organisms; and still more interesting is the paper by Dr. GREGORY on the "Post-tertiary Diatomaceous Sand of Glenshire." The journal is admirably illustrated, and altogether deserves the attention of every microscopist.</p><p>	The complaints of the dullness of the book season grow louder and louder. "It is worse than during the war," exclaim publishers and critics. Considering the vast quantity of excellent literature still unread, it is not to be deplored that a lull in the publication of scarcely readable books should occur. For our own parts we are very placid under the calamity of "nothing coming out now." "No array of terms can tell how much we are at peace" about the absence from the advertizing list of the profound JENKINS, and the impassioned JONES. But there are announcements which change even our indifference into eagerness; for example we hear, on indubitable authority, that Mrs. BROWNING has just completed a new poem of modern life, extending to several thousand verses-for that we would relinquish the last new mollusc, for that we would put aside a whole table of new species! Nay, we hear further, not on such good authority, but nevertheless on authority quite credible, that TENNYSON has written a poem of a few hundred lines, which he contemplates publishing separately; and we hear also that ALEXANDER SMITH has a new volume to appear in the autumn. May it be worthy of the promise given by his first!</p><p>THE LOVER'S SEAT. </p><p>The Lover's Seat. Kathem rina or Common Things in Relation to Beauty, Virtue, and Truth. By Kenelm Henry Digby. 2 vols. Longman and Co. </p><p>WE lent the Lover's Seat to two lady friends of very different ages, and they assured us it was a "delightful book;" a fact worth mentioning because 1t shows that whatever objections may be made to Mr. Digby's work from a critical point of view, there is a class of readers with whom it is likely to find acceptance. And since it is every where inspired by rare refinement and moral elevation, since it is obviously the production of a man who is both morally and intellectually more entitled to ask an audience for his opinions than ninety-nine writers out of a hundred, the larger the audience he finds, the better. </p><p>	It is now many years since Mr. Kenelm Digby became known to the public through his authorship of the Broad Stone of Honour, and, by the mediaeval enthusiasm manifested in that work, made comprehensible as well as noteworthy his subsequent conversion to Catholicism. It is desirable to recollect these biographical particulars in connexion with the Lover's Seat, because they render all the more remarkable the fine spirit of tolerance and charity which is the strongest characteristic of the book. Converts or "perverts" are proverbially virulent, but the author is one of those exceptional persons who learn by their own variations to tolerate and comprehend the variations of others.</p><p>	But, setting aside the admirable sentiments by which for a time the Lover's Seat throws our critical spirit into abeyance, and measuring the book simply by the demands of literary art, we are obliged to say that it is deficient in some most important requisites. The writer, apparently, like many men of various and extensive reading, has a note-book which, as Southey said of his own, is "like an urn under the arm of a river-god;" and the existence of this note-book is, we imagine, the proximate cause of the two volumes now offered to the public. For the Lover's Seat is a mosaic of quotations inlaid in a comparatively small portion of material from the writer's own pen, at least if we accept all the anonymous quotations as genuine, and do not suppose them to be put in this form merely as a device of style. Such a device would be a particularly unfortunate one, for the incessant citation renders the book wearisome for continuous reading, while the absence of any precise classification prevents it from being available as a repertory of extracts. Another great mistake in the structure of the book is the dimly indicated velleity towards dialogue, in the supposition that the long discourses which form the successive chapters are uttered at the "Lover's Seat" either to a pair of lovers or by the lover of the more honourable gender to his companion, for the writer appears to vacillate in his plan. This ghost of a dramatic intention sometimes appears so ludicrously in company with the very adagio and essay-like style of the writer, that it would be extremely easy to satirize the Lover's Seat, and make it appear a silly, twaddling book. But "everything has two handles," and sympathy and veneration for just and noble sentiments are so much better things than satire, that we prefer holding up to our readers the more admirable aspect of Mr. Digby's work, and selecting from it some passages which will give a fair idea of its merits.</p><p>	One habit which we particularly relish in the writer is the felicity with which he extracts lessons of indulgence and kindliness from Scriptural passages and incidents, which have been far from yielding such honey to the majority of those who make an equally diligent use of the Bible. An</p><p>example of this occurs in the following passage:- </p><p>	None of us are aerial. Aurelia, in the old play, protests for her part against such an assumption, and says,-</p><p>	"What would you have me do?</p><p>	D'ye think I'm the Dutch virgin that could live</p><p>	By th' scent of flowers; or that my family</p><p>	Are all descended of cameleons</p><p>	And can be kept with air?"</p><p>"If a poor half-starved priest pays his court to an olla podrida with gusto, shall we say," asks Hazlitt, "that he has no other sentiments in offering his devotion before a crucifix, or in counting his heads? We might as well affirm that Handel was not in earnest when he sat down to compose a symphony, because he had at the same tune perhaps a bottle of cordials in bis cupboard." To fall asleep while no less a person than St. Paul was preaching, would seem an offence, in the estimation of some transcendentalists, equivalent with ugly symptoms of final reprobation; but St. Paul himself taught us the lesson of humanity in that respect; for when the youth Eutychus, dropping asleep during his sermon, fell from an open window, the apostle went down, embraced the body, and restored him to life. The assistants led back the boy alive and well, "et consolati sunt non minime." Not a word seems to have escaped any one about the impropriety of what the lad had done in having suffered himself to sleep while God spoke through his chosen messenger. But further, we have all of us our fancies too; and humanity would teach us the habit of respecting them in each other. Some dislike to be reminded of their own age. It is a fancy of theirs. Well, then, humanity would not be always reminding them of it, as a transcendental divine would </p><p>736  THE LEADER. [No. 332, SATURDAY,</p><p>recommend. Dr. Johnson one day, when in advanced life, met one who had been his fellow-collegian, a dull but good man, whom he had not seen since they were at the university, who began talking about their respective years. "Don't let us discourage one another," said Johnson, interrupting him and changing the conversation to an other topic. In fine, constituted as we are, we must have our prejudices and our exaggerations even; and when these are innocent, for they may be so, humanity winks at them. Hear what a great author says, but without supposing that he contradicts anything lately heard respecting moderation, for everything, as my Uncle Toby says, bas two handles. "Exaggeration," says he, "is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, no men into the world without adding a small excess of his proper quality. Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way; in every instance a slight generosity, a drop too much. Without this violence of direction which men and women have, without a spice of exaggeration, no excitement, no efficiency. We aim above the mark to hit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood of excess in it; and when now and then comes along some sad sharp-eyed man, who refuses to play at this game, but blabs the secret, the wary Nature sends a new troop of fairer forms, of lordlier youths with a little more excess cf direction to hold them fast to their several aims, makes them a little wrong-headed in that direction in which they are rightest, and on goes the game again with a new whirl." </p><p>	And again:-</p><p>	Is it not strange that grave men professing holiness should overlook the care evinced in the divine oracles to convince us that even truth itself is not of such moment as the exercise of toleration; that charity is greater than faith and hope? that love actually overthrows the barriers between union and division, between what God ordains and what the perversity of man occasions, raising those associated with the latter above all whom the former seems to glorify? For what other end than to convey this lesson is it recorded that the only one out of the ten lepers who returned to give glory to God when cured was a Samaritan? that he who did what all others are charged to do, was also a Samaritan? Can human thought conceive a spirit more profoundly tolerant than that which breathes in the words of the chief of the Apostles when alluding to the death of Christ, he says, "Et nunc fratres scio quia per iqnorantiam fecistis, sicut et principes nostri?" No, no; the mercy that doth outstretch the universe will not be insufficient for one soul. Can the common sense of mankind be more indulgent than the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles, saying, without intending to disparage the force of true authority, "He who observeth the day, observeth it to the Lord, and he who eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eateth not, eateth not to the Lord, and gives thanks to God? Therefore, let us not any longer judge one another,-non ergo amplius invicem judicemus." What is the one concurrent voice of religion unless that re-echoed by the universal Church and by the human conscience?</p><p>	"Wilt thou draw near the nature of our God?</p><p>	Draw near Him then in being merciful."</p><p>Where is its real operation seen but in him who follows that noble counsel, </p><p>	"Weep for the frail that err, the weak that fall;</p><p>	Have thine own faith, but hope and pray for all?"</p><p>In teaching us very forcibly that we should quicken our perception of the good and the lovely by being constantly on the watch for it in common things, the author points to one of Dickens's greatest qualities:- </p><p>	To one who considers the various and multiplied kinds of observation in which men indulge, it may be a subject of surprise that by way of novelty some do not at times watch for the sake of finding virtues as so many do, in order to discover faults in others. I promise them that, without looking under these boughs, they would not have long to wait to put up game of this sort in abundance if they have only eyes that will see it ; but it is the exception always that exclusively strikes them, when something goes wrong, and they are wholly blind to the wonderful interchange and play of graces which keep society together. It is an axiom of jurisprudence,-"quod communiter fit censetur legitime fieri." No doubt in all Christian ages the principle will apply to a great extent in the moral order also, where what is recognized as good, is, after all, only a conformity with the Divine plan in general. Wickedness is a thing contrary to nature; it is striking, hideous, deformed, inconvenient, offensive to every common judgment, hateful when discovered. When seen, every one remarks it, and cries out. Vices are in their nature intermittent, and comparatively rare; whereas virtues are always before us, and their continuous succession drives one another out. What an admirable watcher in this respect is Dickens, who not only sees, but forces us to see goodness in very minute things: in a Kit bashfully bidding his mother "get out;" in a Short's resolution, that "he's not a going to stand that," when he thinks Nell has been stolen from her friend; in a Swiveller only just out of a fever, and, hearing how he can save the lad, crying out to the little nurse, and plucking off his nightcap and flinging it to the other end of the room, "Marchioness, if you'll do me the favour to retire for a few minutes and I'll get up;" in the dying boy afraid to kiss a loved one lest he should make her ill; in an ostler almost hating himself for deceiving two children lovers about a pony for their good. Thus does this great magician-for it really seems a case of magic when we are on some points brought to the use of our senses-enable us to employ our eyes and ears. When once awakened by the touch of a wand like his, we may all take the initiative in this same course. We can then all of us see goodness in the common things that pass daily before our eyes; in the smile of kind approval bestowed by some one passing us; in the youth that listens to the street musician ; in the gruff voice that calls the inattentive girl to pass running before the bridge is drawn,-and so on for ever. It would be well if we were to adopt the practice of painters, and apply it to the general spectacle of human life. "Quam multa vident pictores," exclaims Cicero, "in umbris et in eminentia quae nos non videmus !" The untrained, as Hazlitt says, only see nature as it is reflected to them from art. The painter sees the picture in nature before he transfers it to the canvas. He refines, he analyzes, he remarks fifty things which escape common eyes; and this affords a distinct source of reflection and amusement to him, independently of the beauty and grandeur of the objects themselves. The critic dwells with delight on the grace and beauty of the picture; but who will suppose that the painter had not the same pleasure in detecting these nice distinctions in nature? Painters see beauty where others see nothing of the sort; in torn stockings, dusty feet, in a poor room, in a broken pitcher. Let a moralist study men and women with the same attention, and he will find the beauties of goodness in the most minute and despised details of common life.</p><p>	Here is a passage which we commend to the attention of red-hot Protestants:-</p><p>	We need not say in the style of Reviewers, that no schoolboy is ignorant of what we perhaps ourselves have only just discovered; but I think we may affirm, that no one of any consideration in the republic of letters, as the learned call it, any longer pretends that intolerance was confined to any class or portion of the world. The Presbyterians of the Long Parliament in England, who persecuted three sections of their countrymen,-the Puritans of Boston, who wished to sell for slaves those who could not pay the fines incurred by their religious dissent,-the Calvinists, Lutherans, and Anglicans, were all as obnoxious to the charge of intolerance as those who resisted their first advances, while, by the way, offering the cardinal's hat to Erasmus the champion of liberty, and expressing with Bossuet their affection for Melancthon and Bull,-all were intolerant. But the beautiful lessons which our Saviour taught, and which celestial men, combining with their instructions what is common, age after age transmitted, have wrought through long centuries into the common mind and popular thought, have found an echo in the general heart, and no one can now arrest this tendency, bring back Tyburn or the cells of Venice, with the bigot's rack or harden the softening human heart again. "Which is the work that remains," asks a French writer, "that of Luther substituting a system of opinions for what he found existing, or that of Erasmus claiming for man liberty of conscience, and adopting the sublime word of Christian philosophy? Which has now most life? this Christian philosophy, or Lutheranism, or any other sectarian system confiscating liberty of conscience for its own profit?" While again protesting against the imputation of having a double and concealed object in such reflections, may we be permitted for once to hear what can be advanced, especially on one side, in reply to the charge often brought against it of greatest intolerance? What is most attacked needs most the defence of the generous. The thoughts of men respecting differences in religion are not now some one will say, exactly what they were in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I see, he will continue, but two opinions at present,-the one of those who think that sects should disappear; that there should be union among all, founded on the mutual recognition of one another's errors, and on the assumed hopelessness of having one truth, one external communion; the other of those who believe that sects should disappear; that there should be union among all, founded first on an external communion among those who hold that there is such a thing as truth in matters of religion; and that as many as can be moved by the grounds of credibility in its fayour should embrace it; and, secondly, on the belief that there may be a sincere union of love, involving every kind of service between those forming this communion and those without it externally, who are so swayed by circumstances and involuntary ignorance as not to perceive that they ought to belong to it; and that with them they may be united in their present pilgrimage, on the common ground of humanity and charity, from which I suppose religion itself is not to be excluded,-and eventually, by means with which they are unacquainted, in Him who alone knows what spirit all were of. It is not easy to perceive how this latter view is less favourable to an enlarged, intellectual, and practical toleration, than the former. What is there in it to prevent those who hold it from regarding with an infinite love every one of the human race? One may think, on the contrary, that it is more conducive to this universal love and forbearance than the former view; because, if all idea of possessing truth be hopeless, we have no guarantee beyond a sentimentality, which, in some relations, is very uncertain, for that very forbearance and love, which, in spite of what may be objected from the history of the past, springs out of a conviction of that truth which expressly inculcates forbearance and universal love, and not out of despair, or out of the notion that since all cannot think alike on such matters, when men suppose themselves to be perishing, they ought to wish to perish with all rather than be separated from others, while involved in the commun ruin. I repeat it,-the love of toleration will dispose us, even at the risk of appearing to exercise a double part, to hear with most patience what can be alleged in defence of what is most accused, even though that bearing may tend to a supposition of its being the least guilty.</p><p>	Let not the reader suspect that we are on the way to become "perverts" because we select passages which seem to prove the existence of that supposed paradox, a tolerant Catholic. We do so on the ground which is well expressed by Mr. Digby when he says:-</p><p>	Man's chief wisdom is fairness; fairness turns even to his own advantage; and fairness is shown in recognizing neutral ground, and meeting on it with a friendly feeling towards all, seeking, as far as one can, ways of union and accordance, which, while never dangerous to truth, are best obtained gradually, step by step, following the river's gentle windings, not the harsh, straight lines and parallels, that have more the air of a wish to protract for ever warlike operations, than of that equity and benevolence to which the heart and that will which so rules the understanding are sure soonest to surrender, if they ought to do so.</p><p>	If any one objects that all this liberality is logically inconsistent with Catholicism, we can only reply that we prefer illogical virtues to logical vices, and still more to illogical vices, of which one of the commonest is Protestant intolerance.</p><p>FERNY COMBES. </p><p>Ferny Combes: a Ramble after Ferns in the Glens and Valleys of Devonshire. By </p><p>Charlotte Chanter. Reeve. </p><p>FERNY COMBES! The very words are a treat to us in warm weather, and </p><p>make us feel cooler as we write them. Every one who has been in Devon- </p><p>shire knows that a Combe is a vale or glen - an opening between the hills, </p><p>sometimes so wide that a town can nestle in it, sometimes so narrow that </p><p>nothing but a rivulet can make its cunning way along the hollow, and some- </p><p>times threaded by a winding lane, where you may either look at the grand </p><p>curtain of hills all round you, or let your eye fall on the slate-built bank </p><p>beside you, every yard of which is a study for a painter like Hunt - an en- </p><p>chanting confusion of starry flowers, delicate trefoil, and long, waving </p><p>fronds. </p><p>And among all the lovely things that grow along the lanes and on the </p><p>hills of Devonshire, Ferns are some of the loveliest. There is this addi- </p><p>tional temptation to their study, that they may be dried without losing their </p><p>beauty, and that, as Mrs. Chanter tells us, the collector "has but to open </p><p>his 'Fern-book,' and the forms of his favourites appear before him as green </p><p>and graceful as when they hung by the mountain torrent, or waved in some </p><p>quiet, shady lane, bringing back to remembrance pleasant summer rambles </p><p>amid lovely scenes, making the heart swell with gladness at the recollection </p><p>of the forms of beauty and purity on which he has been permitted to gaze." </p><p>Moreover, the most dismal London drawing-room stared at by "naked- </p><p>eyed" houses, and in which no flowers will flourish, may have a wreath of </p><p>poetry brought into it by a glass-case of living ferns, looking always fresh </p><p>and happy, as you return from "taking the dust" in Hyde Park, or even </p><p>when you light the gas at mid-day in a November fog. Hear Mrs. Chanter's </p><p>practical directions to those who have not many shillings to spare on super- </p><p>fluities:- </p><p>You may have your pretty friends the ferns green and bright all the winter through </p><p>in your sitting-room, only you must keep them from impure air, and shield them </p><p>in part from the changes of temperature to which a sitting-room is liable. If you </p><p>live in a large town, you may for a couple of shillings buy a bell-glass sufficiently </p><p>large to cover seven or eight pots; in the country the glass will cost half as much </p><p>again. If you stand your plants on a round tin tray, to prevent the moisture spoiling </p><p>anything on which they are placed, and cover them over with your glass, you will, at </p><p>the expense of a few shillings, have a miniature greenhouse, which will give you </p><p>much amusement. You should occasionally take off the glass and water the plants, </p><p>being careful not to let them get too damp, as the crown is apt to decay. </p><p>This is an inexpensive "closed case." Those who have money to spare may, for </p><p>thirty shillings or two pounds, have a Wardian case, in fact a miniature covered </p><p>garden, for the ferns, which, instead of being in pots, are planted in the mould with </p><p>which the bottom or tray is filled. </p><p>It is much more pleasant to collect one's own plants than to buy them; and if you </p><p>are provided with that indispensable requisite "a tin case," that is, an oblong tin </p><p>box which closes tightly, you may take plants any distance. I have now plants of </p><p>Polypodium Dryopteris and Allosorus crispus that I carried about for three weeks. </p><p>But we must tell our readers more particularly what this pretty book is, </p><p>from which we have been quoting. It is a little volume of not much more than </p><p>a hundred pages, containing not only a description of Devonshire ferns with </p><p>eight excellent illustrations, but also, as an introduction to this more special </p><p>matter, a charming sketch of an excursion through the finest and least </p><p>known districts of Devon, whither, very frequently, only your own horse or </p><p>carriage can take you. We can wish for nothing pleasanter at this moment </p><p>in the way of excursions, than to find ourselves in North Devon, in that </p><p>guarantee of respectability, a gig, and making the very tour along which </p><p>Mrs. Chanter has carried us in imagination. A very agreeable companion </p><p>she is in this imaginary tour, for there is an ardour in her enjoyment of </p><p>nature, and a happy way of describing and narrating, which is the less sur- </p><p>prising when one knows that she is a sister of Charles Kingsley. </p><p>One great attraction in the tour described by Mrs. Chanter - at least to </p><p>those who shudder at watering places which leave only a general impression </p><p>of eyes and flounces and bad German bands - is that it takes you to scenes </p><p>where the delicious sounds of Nature are not drowned or scared away, and </p><p>where her beauties are not all ticketed with a price. England is not yet </p><p>quite transformed into continuous tea-gardens. For example:- </p><p>Bickleigh! Here we had determined to stay the night. It was six o'clock when </p><p>we reached the village, and we had no wish to travel through a strange country in </p><p>the dark. But we reckoned without our host, or hostess rather, who came to the </p><p>door and informed us that there was a ploughing-match on the morrow, and that in </p><p>consequence her house was full. "She was very sorry; she would have obliged us </p><p>gladly, but she really could not accommodate us." </p><p>"Where can we go then?" we inquired, having fully made up our minds not to go </p><p>to Plymouth, only a few miles distant. "Oh, at Jump, three miles off, you will be </p><p>certain to find room," was the reply. We went to Jump; we entered the inn, were </p><p>taken for two tramps by the landlady, who had not seen us arrive, beat a hasty re- </p><p>treat, and, in spite of our horse's weariness and our own hunger, started for Tavistock, </p><p>eight miles off, where, after a pleasant drive by moonlight, and many a laugh at our </p><p>reception by the landlady of the "Jump Hotel," we found a good supper, civility, </p><p>and attention at the Beaufort Arms. </p><p>Traveling in Devonshire, if you leave the beaten track, is not always very easy; </p><p>from three inns in one day did we turn away unrefreshed. Of course, when we speak </p><p>of inns, they were only such as an enthusiastic lover of the romantic, an angler, or </p><p>pedestrian, would condescend to put his head into. "Pride goeth before a fall" is </p><p>an old proverb; but "Pride destroys a multitude of pleasures" is a true one of mo- </p><p>dern days, particularly as regards inns, because if you do not occasionally condescend </p><p>to a humble lodging, some of the most beautiful parts of your own land must remain </p><p>a terra incognita. In foreign countries people frequent inns they would despise in</p><p>poor old England; and as to fare, a good dish of eggs and bacon, nice white bread </p><p>and fresh butter, are certainly preferable to a wretched omelette flavoured with garlic, </p><p>black bread, and unmentionable butter, which are the stable commodities at country </p><p>inns on the Continent. </p><p>Many people only think of Dartmoor in connexion with mutton, or with </p><p>prisons and penal settlements. We will give them a more poetic or cheerful </p><p>association with it by quoting a fragment of Mrs. Chanter's spirited descrip- </p><p>tion:- </p><p>Out upon the hills! the glorious, granite-capped hills of Dartmoor, breezy and </p><p>fresh! Thousands of acres free from cultivation, for Nature has put her own seal </p><p>upon them. Ages, ages ago were those huge blocks of granite strewn about, defying </p><p>man to intrude on Nature's solitude; for who could remove all those countless myriads </p><p>of stones, to till the ground that lies beneath? </p><p>Yet centuries ago this wild region, and the wildest parts of it, now deserted by man, </p><p>were the abodes of a curious, wonderful people. Dartmoor was one of the strongholds </p><p>of the Druids; and the many "hut circles," "stone avenues," tolmens, and </p><p>cromlechs, show them to have been a numerous people, marvelously attached to </p><p>stones. </p><p>Their peculiarly pet place, Wistman's Wood, is unique. Gigantic blocks of granite, </p><p>so puled one on the other that the only way to get along is to jump from stone to </p><p>stone. Woe betide you if you put your foot on a nice tempting piece of sedge or </p><p>grass! The thin crust speedily gives way, and you may chance to get wedged in </p><p>between Druidical remains. </p><p>From among the rocks spring ancient oaks, known as ancients even in ancient days, </p><p>gnarled and stunted, clothed with hoary mosses and parasitical plants. </p><p>Not long ago we found numerous rabbit-paths along the branches of the trees. Do </p><p>naturalists record the fact that rabbits frequent trees; or is it peculiar to those in </p><p>Wistman's Wood? </p><p>Wise people say that Wistman's Wood ought to be "Wise Man's Wood," in honour </p><p>of the very clever and intellectual people who once resided there. Having a slight </p><p>knowledge of the Devonshire vernacular, we make so bold as to suggest that "whist" </p><p>or "wist" signifies sorrowful, mournful. Any one who has visited Wistman's Wood </p><p>can hardly fail to have been struck with the doleful moans and sighing which </p><p>assail him on all sides (added to his own if he have a tumble, no unlikely thing), </p><p>making him fancy that a regiment of Arch-Druids and Bards are bewailing the over- </p><p>throw of their altars, the desecration of their circles, the standing still of their rocking- </p><p>stones.</p><p>In visiting Dartmoor from North Devon the best route is through Torrington to </p><p>Oakhampton. The former most beautifully situated on a steep bank overhanging the </p><p>Torridge; the latter in the pretty valley of the Ockment "Under the Moor." </p><p>Oakhampton is a dull, deserted-looking place, but there are many sights in the </p><p>neighbourhood which it is considered necessary for those professing to have seen Dart- </p><p>moor to have visited; whether they are worth the trouble must depend on the taste </p><p>of the visitor. Yea Tor, the highest peak in Devonshire, rises, about five miles from </p><p>the town, to a height of upwards of two thousand feet. The view from the summit is </p><p>extensive; the hills of Exmoor away in the north, Rough Tor and Brown Willy in </p><p>the West, while near at hand the rival hill of Cawasnd Beacon and the minor tons </p><p>and bogs of "the Moor" stretch away for miles; but the ascent is difficult and toil- </p><p>some, over huge masses of granite which lie scattered in every direction; indeed in </p><p>some places not a blade of grass is to be seen; it is literally a hill of rocks. Cawasnd </p><p>Beacon and Taw Marsh are also among the sights of this neighbourhood, but are hardly </p><p>worth a visit from any one who has braved the rocks of Yea Tor, as the view is very </p><p>much the same, and the bogs far more abundant. But if you really wish to see the </p><p>moor and do not mind "roughing it," there are two or three out-of-the-way places </p><p>where you may manage to exist for a day or two. And first, on the high road be- </p><p>tween Oakhampton and Tavistock we shall find the "Dartmoor Inn." I give you </p><p>warning that your fare may be nothing more luxurious than eggs and bacon, spark- </p><p>ling beer, and sparkling water; but it will be served to you on so white a table as per- </p><p>chance your eyes ne'er lighted on, and your snowy sheets will smell refreshingly of </p><p>mountain peat. </p><p>One thing we wish Mrs. Chanter had not done at the opening of her book </p><p>- namely, argue with certain persons who may inquire "What is the advan- </p><p>tage of knowing the names of a set of weeds which are of no use to any </p><p>one?" Argument is far too great a compliment to pay to people who can </p><p>take no interest in a plant unless they can be told that it will cure the colic, </p><p>or that it tastes well when boiled and served up with sauce. When her </p><p>pretty little book reaches a second edition, as it deserves to do, we hope she </p><p>will re-write her first three pages, and give it a more worthy opening than </p><p>pedagogical remarks, rather questionable in their logic, to people who are </p><p>not likely to profit by her remarks even if they were less questionable. </p><p>RECOLLECTIONS OF HEINE. </p><p>Heinrich Heine. Erinnerungen von Alfred Meissner. (Recollections of Heinrich Heine, by Alfred Meissner. </p><p>It is the base habit of us mortals generally, to enjoy the first and find fault with them afterwards, to reap some pleasant fruit from other men’s doings and then cry out against them as misdorings. Thus we, after running through these Recollections of Heine with considerable interest, and gathering from them several details which enable us to correct or fill up the picture of him in our imagination, are inclined, now we lay down Herr Meissner's book, to blame him for falling into the temptation of bookmaking, and diluting into a volume the matter which might easily have been conveyed in an article. But since, after all, the volume is a small one, and is written agreeably enough, we repress our critical impulse, and prefer noticing with satisfaction the at once sympathetic and impartial spirit in which these Recollections are written. Herr Meissner is himself a poet, and what is more, a poet with whom Heine never quarreled; during several long visits to Paris he was a frequent visitor, and in the intervals a constant correspondent of Heine’s; and he saw him both alone and in the society of others at different stages of his seven years' lingering death; so that he gives us the experience of an appreciatory friend, and not the gossip of a tourist or a lion-hunter. The fact that this experience was always personally agreeable to himself has not prevented him from forming a sober estimate of Heine, and he does not discredit his own testimony by indiscriminating laudation. Considering his opportunities, we might have expected a greater amount of positive material in these Recollections, if we had not remembered how fragmentary and often incommunicable are the particulars from which we build up our conception even of many whom we call our intimate friends. Herr Meissner, however, has the power of reproducing such particulars with considerable vividness, and from his successive sketches, for which he assures us he has not drawn on his memory, but on notes carefully made while a scene or conversation was fresh in his mind, the reader may very well gather an idea of Heine's habits and entourage at different epochs during the later years of his life.</p><p>Nothing could be more common-place than Heine's Paris home--three small rooms on the third story, moderately furnished, and looking on a narrow, dimly-lighted court. The sitting-room had the usual white marble chimney-piece, with the inevitable Parisian mirror and vases filled with artificial flowers; and this chimney-piece was the most striking object in the room. All that seemed exceptional about this home was, that when you knocked at the door, it was opened by an old pock-marked negress, in a motley silk turban, and you heard the screaming of a parrot from Madame Heine's room. </p><p>And what sort of woman was Madame Heine? Here is Meissner's answer to this question:-- </p><p>It is possible to be of opinion that Heine ought to have made a different choice, but it must be admitted that his marriage was characteristic and poetic. He had lived several years with his wife--Crescence Mathilde Mirat was her full name--without being married to her. It was one of those unions which are so frequent in Paris that they are almost legitimized in the eyes of the world, and are called menages Parisiens. Innumerable are the marriages of this kind, especially among artists; the woman enjoys all the rights of a legitimate wife, and only the most intimate friends know that the ecclesiastical blessing and the civil contract are wanting. It is only after the lapse of some years--usually when there are children and the parents become more closely linked together--that the sanction of the church is sought for, and that happens as with Beranger, who in a similar way lived for years with his much sung Lisette: </p><p>	"Ces deux epoux-ont mis enfin</p><p>	De l’eau Mnite dans leur vin."</p><p>Heine had no children; but, on the other hand, there was another reason for his completing his marriage in the strictest form. It was the duel with Herr S. In order that Matilda might not be unprovided for, that his relative might take care of her, in case of his death, he made her his wife. . . . . . Matilda's nature was the simplest, and her amusements the most harmless conceivable. To chat with her parrot, with Pauline, her companion--to take a drive every day is the Champs Elysees, and them tell what she had seen--this was her life. Heine had a true horror of a learned and strong-minded woman, a blue-stocking, and a feminine reasoner; Matilda attached him by her innocent chat, her cheerful dispostion, and he excellent heart. She had a crucifix and a small waxen Jesus in her room; and kept up the practice of prayer in which she had been bred. Heine never disturbed her in these habits. "She is a child, a perfect child!" he used to say; and he was right. . . . In his last years Heine required two nurses, so much was there to be done for him almost uninterruptedly. It is evident that the active assistance of his wife was thus rendered superfluous. Nevertheless, she sat by his bed, held his hand in hers, watched by him, did not leave him. But he, roguish in the midst of his suffering, made the drollest accusations against her with half-supprressed laughter. "And what a night was last night!" he said one morning. "I was not able to close my eyes. We had a misfortune in the house; the cat fell down the chimney and grazed her right ear. It even bled a little. Such a crying and wailing! My good Matilda sat up and applied cold bandages to the cat all night. She never sat up on my account." . . . But this was only the summer lightning of his playful nature. When I remember, and weigh everything, I believe that the poet loved his Matilda more than any being on earth. On his sick-bed, under the severest pains, his thought were constantly directed to the means of protecting her dignity before the world, and giving her a secure position for the remainder of her life. It was his perpetual regret that, in the days of his prosperity, he had been to improvident, and had saved nothing; and he sought with all his powers to remedy this omission. It was only for her sake that he strung up his last energies for work, and every clause in his Will bears witness to a solicitude which extended beyond his own death. She was his dol, whome he loved to adorn in silk and lace, and whom he would willingly have dressed in the most beautiful things to be found in Paris. He sent her out to walk, he sent her to theatres and concerts, smiled when she approached him, and had for her nothing but jokes and caressing words. In his intellectual activity she never took any part; of his mental struggles she knew nothing; but she lived in him and stood faithfully by his side for twenty years. He used to say, laughingly, that she had never read a line of his writings. It might be supposed that this would wound him; on the contrary, it amused him. Thus, for Madame Heine, he husband was not the great poet that he was for the rest of the world; but he was for her what the rest of the world denied him to be--an affectionate, upright man.</p><p>While we are on the affectionate side of Heine's character, we may cite a pretty trait of his feeling towards his mother, of whome he says to charmingly </p><p>	"Nach Deutschland lechzt' ich nicht so sehr,</p><p>	Wenn nicht die Mutter doren wan!</p><p>	Das Vaterland wird nich verderben,</p><p>	Jedoch die alte Frau kenn sterben!"--</p><p>he would not yearn so sadly after his naive land, if his mother were not there! Germany is not likely to vanish from the face of the earth, but the old woman can die! </p><p>On evening (says Herr Meissner), I happened to look in on Heine, just as he was dictating a letter to his secretary, and on my asking him to whom he was writing, he answered: "To my mother." "She is still living, then?" I asked. "Yes," he said, "old and sick and feeble, alas! but still with the same warm mother's heart." "And you often writer to her?" "Regularly every month." "How distressed she must be at your condition?" "At my condition?" answered Heine. "Oh, as to that, my mother supposes me to be as strong and healthy as I was when she last saw me. She is old and never reads the newspaper; the few old friends who visit her are in the same predicament. I write to her as cheerfully as I can; tell her about my wife, and how well things are going with me. As it might surprise her that only the signature is from my hand, and all the rest from that of the secretary, I tell her that I have a complaint in the eyes, which will by-and-by be cured[?], but which in the meantime prevents me from writing everything myself. And so she is happy. For the rest, no mother could believe that her son was so ill and wretched as I am."</p><p>At the end of a long conversation on the Jews, recorded by Meissner, Heine sums up his feeling towards them in this way:-- </p><p>"You hear, by dear Meissner, how I almost in one breath ridicule[?] and compassionate the Jews; in fact, they appear to me at once ludicrous and venerable. I could not devote myself to them entirely, as Gabriel Riesser and others have done; I unite myself with no party, whether republicans or patriots, Christians or Jews. I have this in common with all artists who write not for enthusiastic moments, but for centuries--not for one land, but for the world--not for one race, but for mankind. It would be absurd and petty in me if, as people pretend, I had ever been ashamed of being a Jew; but it would be just as ridiculous if I declared myself to be a Jew. . . . As I was born to deliver over the bad and the rotten, the false and the foolish, to eternal ridicule, so it is equally in my nature to feel what is sublime, to admire what is great, and to venerate whatever has true life." Heine had spoken the last[?] words with deep earnestness, and had become thoughtful. But, as if laughter must always resume its wonted seat on his lips, he added, playfully, "If our little friend Weill come to see us soon, you shall have another proof of my piety towards primitive Mosaism. Weill was formerly a singer in the synagogue; he has a find bell-like tenor, and chants the old songs of Judah in all their traditional purity, from their earliest monotonous simplicity to their latest point of Old Testament finish. My good wife, who has no notion that I am a Jew, was not a little amazed when she heard this strange musical lament, this shaking and quavering. When Weill began his first song, Minko the dog crept under the sofa, and Cocotte the parrot tried to hang himself between the bars of his cage. 'Monsieur Weill! Monsieur Weill!' Matilda cried out, in alarm, 'don't carry the joke too far!' Weill went on. Matilda turned to me and said, 'Henry, tell me what songs are these?' 'They are our German national songs,' I answered; and I have obstinately persisted in this assertion." </p><p>Heine, to the last, wrote everything himself, except his letters. Paper and pencil lay before him, and as he was able, he wrote in a large hand his latest poems and his yet unpublished Memoirs. When he was tired, or indisposed to work, his wife read to him such light things as Dumas's novels; but he also went through a great deal of serious reading, especially in physiology, anatomy, and pathology. He made himself familiar with the most elaborate works bearing on his own disease. "My studies," he used to say, "will certainly not be ofmuch use to me. At the utmost, they will enable me to give lectures in heaven, in order to demonstrate to my audience how poorly the physicians on earth know how to treat diseases of the spine." On another occasion, he said, "My nerves are so utterly shattered, that I am sure at the Expostition they would win the great fold medal for pain and misery." </p><p>Few friends bear such a test of constancy as a seven years' illness, especially in a great city, and one is not surprised that the visits to Heine's sick room became fewer and farther between as the years wore on. One day, when Berlioz was announced, Heine exclaimed, "What! some one coming to see me! Berlioz is always original!" But in the very last months Heine was soothed by the visits of a new friend, a young lady of "unusual intellectual powers," and it is touching to read his notes to her, some of which Herr Meissner has been permitted to publish. We will quote one--and it must be our last quotation--written at the beginning of January, 1856:-- </p><p>Dearest Mouche! I am very suffering, and vexed to death, and the lid of my right eye falls, so that I can hardly write any more. But I love you and think of you, sweetest one! The novel has not bored me, and it gives good hopes for the future--you are not so stupid as you look! Charming you are beyond all measure, and therein my soul delights. Shall I see you to-morrow? A sort of weeping malaise overpowers me. My heart gapes spasmodically. These buillements are intolerable. I wish I were dead! Deepest anguish, thy name is--HEINRICH HEINE."</p><p>FELICE ORSINI. </p><p>The Austrian Dungeons in Italy: Narrative of Fifteen Months' Imprisonment and Final Escape from the Fortress of S. Giorgio. By Felice Orsini. Translated from the unpublished Manuscript by J. Meriton White. Routledge and Co. </p><p>Ir de Foe were alive again, and had to rewrite his History of the Devil, he could hardly add a more striking supplementary chapter than one on Austrian prisons and Austrian tribunals in Italy, and among all the memoires pour servir that he might consult, he could hardly find anything more to his purpose than this little book, in which Felice Orsini, now happily safe in London, tells us the story of his imprisonment and the terrible contingencies of his escape. It has not the literary charm belonging to Silvio Pellico's narrative which we have known a young student of Italian, in blissful ignorance of Austrian policy, to take for a romance, and devour it with a culpable reliance on 'guessing' instead of the dictionary. For though the matter of Felice Orsini's narrative is everywhere of great interest, it is thrown together with little art, and the early part is so desultory in its arrangement, that it reads like hasty notes. But it has one grave source of superior influence on the reader, namely, that it recounts recent facts-that it sets before us Austrian prisons and tribunals as they are in the present day, and does not allow us to get rid of painful sympathy by conjecturing that 'things are different now.' </p><p>Felice Orsini was born, he tells us, in 1819. He is a man of education, and was brought up under prosperous circumstances. His ostensible profession has been the law, but, as with so many others of his countrymen, the main object of his life has been conspiracy against the Austrian Government-an object which, when it has succeeded, men will call heroism, but until then, folly. His experience as a political prisoner began when he was only three-and-twenty, and this beginning was anything but a mild one, for, not to mention other particulars, in a journey from Pesaro to Rome he was chained to eight thieves, who were all huddled with him in an open court, and in this fashion they travelled for seventeen days. From this first imprisonment, of two years' duration, he was liberated by the general amnesty published on the accession of Pius IX., and from that time up to the moment of his last arrest, his life was a story of futile conspiracy, 'detentions,' and proscription. But in the present little volume he merely indicates this earlier part of his career, and reserves his space for a minute account of his last fifteen months' imprisonment and his amazing escape, frequently digressing, however, for the sake of illustrating more completely the Austrian mode of treating political offenders. Stories of escapes from prison are always thrilling, and the escape of Felice Orsini is among the most thrilling we remember. For us commonplace people who have never "set our lives upon the hazard of a die," there is always an air of incredibility about these stories, and we are apt to suspect that the narrator has magnified or dressed up his adventures. But such a suspicion is not only ungenerous, it is unintelligent. It is in the nature of a great risk to convert an ordinary event into a crisis: let a drunken man lie asleep on a railway, and some ordinary event which delays a train for five minutes, so that the man is roused in time to walk away, will seem a 'providence,' a coincidence;' and wherever a man is in a state of continuous danger, as when he undertakes to rescue a child from a burning house, every breath of wind that averts the flame from him will seem marvellously timed. So it is with attempts at escape from prison: we think the coincidences amazing-incredible-when nothing happens but what would be altogether usual, if the fact of risk and danger were not co-existent. We will not forestal the interest of the reader in Orsini's narrative by telling it in brief, but there is one little trait in it which we are tempted to notice, because it shows the value of that sort of practical knowledge which is so notably wanting in 'polite' education. In calculating all the casualties of his escape, Orsini of course remembered the probability of his falling down stunned; but he also remembered-and this would not be at all 'of course' with most men-that the first sensation experienced on recovering sensibility is intense thirst. Hence he took care to provide himself with an orange. He was stunned twice, and each time he relieved his consequent thirst with half an orange.</p><p>Since the publication of Silvio Pellico's narrative, Austria has somewhat alleviated the treatment of her political prisoners. The bastinado is rarely administered, and it is disavowed by the officials, and the carcere durissimo is abolished. Felice Orsini was allowed to recieve money from his family, and to purchase even luxuries of diet, and he might, if he chose, have fattened himself into a plethoric subject for the hangman. Still there are frightful harships to be endured in most cases, though the worst features in the Austrian system at present seem to lie less in physical cruelty than in the unscrupulous devices and slow tortures of the judicial process, which has no other object than to prove the prisoner guilty in the end, and in the meantime to entrap him into avowals that will compromise as many of his friends as possible. Two examples of the pretexts on which Italians are arrested, and the amount of evidence on which they are detained and condemned, we will quote, referring the reader to Orsini's volume for still more striking but more lengthy illustrations:- </p><p>In April, 1854, Grioli, a young exile (brother to the priest who was shot) arrived at Brescia, under a false name. He sought out a certain Annibale Feverzani, and finding him in the company of his agent, told him that he was charged with a letter to him from Signor Cazzola, an exile. "I do not receive letters from Cazzola or from any other exiles," was the reply. Grioli pressed the matter no further. A few hours after, he was arrested. Among his papers was found the name of Feverzani. When questioned concerning him, he stated the facts given above. Meanwhile Feverzani wrote a formal letter to the police, stating that he had been visited by an individual who, he suspected, was bound on some political errand. </p><p>Lest the reader should think too harshly of Feverzani, he must know that, according to the Austrian law, whoever is acquainted with any signs of disaffection towards the government, and who fails to give information to the police, is liable to five years of carcere duro ... </p><p>Thus Austria compels all her subjects to become spies, or suffer the terrible alternative. In Lombardy this law is defied; there (such is the indomitable spirit of resistance among the Italians) a patriot may go where he will and be sure of shelter. In my own flight through Lombardy, I was sheltered by individuals whose names I do not even now know, and who thus, merely to help one who hated Austria, placed their substance, their families, their very lives in jeopardy. </p><p>But such abnegation cannot be expected from all, and Feverzani only obeyed the law in denouncing Grioli to the police. He was questioned closely by the superintendent, concerning his relations with the accused. He replied that he had none whatever, and related what had happened in his office in the presence of his commercial agent, who, on being questioned, confirmed the statement. After a long trial, Grioli was sentenced to death; but his sentence was afterwards commuted to eighteen years of carcere duro. </p><p>Meanwhile Feverzani was not set at liberty. The Special Court of Justice allowed that they had no grounds to commit him for trial, and sent the judgment to that effect to the tribunal of Venice; an order returned for the detention of Feverzani, and for his appearance before the Special Inquisition. This was effected. On the 1st of October, 1855, he was conducted to the Castle of S. Giorgio.</p><p>At the examination he was told that if he and his agent had denied Grioli's visit to the office, he would never have been arrested. When he said that he had done all that lay in his power by giving immediate information to the police, the judge replied that before the receipt of his letter Grioli was already arrested; the accused observed that he was not aware of the fact, nor had he imagined that the moment he quitted his office he would fall into the hands of the police. But this reasoning was of no avail; he was handed over to the Special Inquisition, indicted for high treason, and for this crime was condemned to pass five years chained to the other prisoners in galleys. </p><p>The third example concerned me more nearly than the rest. On my journey to Vienna via Trieste, I saw a young man at the theatre whom I thought I knew. I accosted him; he said that my features were familiar to him, but that still he did not know who I was. We chatted about the play for a few minutes, and there our conversation ended. The next day, as I was walking with a young Italian then serving in the Austrian army, I met him again. I said that I thought I remembered having met him in Rome, and that his name was Ernesto Galvagni. He replied that this was possible, but that he did not recal the circumstance. I gave him my card, bearing my ficticious name of Giorgio Hernagh, and he out of politeness gave me his. The police discovered that I had spoken with Galvagni at Trieste. Questioned concerning him, and concerning much else at the same time, I said that I had known Galvagni at Rome, and that I had accidentally met him at Trieste. On this admission Signor Galvagni was arrested on the 4th of March, 1855, and subjected to the Special Inquisition. It is proved beyond all doubt that he had no political relation with me, but he is nevertheless detained on account of not having denounced me to the police. Before escaping from the castle I again declared formally Signor Sanchez that Signor Galvagni had never known me under my real name of Orsini, that I never uttered this name at Trieste, that he knew me simply as Hernagh, and that he was entirely innocent, which fact I had stated during my first examination. For all this, Signor Galvagni is still a prisoner in the castle of Mantua. </p><p>Let the reader judge from these statements whether it is possible for an accused person to act in an open, straightforward manner when brought before an Austrian tribunal. No! in order to clear himself he must have recourse to every kind of stratagem, and to evasions and downright falsehoods concerning others, if he wishes to avoid being the means of snatching numberless brave youths from the bosom of their families, and of condemning them to languish for years in prison, and often to die on the scaffold. </p><p>SIGHT-SEEING IN GERMANY AND THE TYROL. </p><p>“TWO kinds of summer tourists find fit representatives in Sir John Forbes and Mr. Walter White. The one travels along railroads and rivers, easily and leisurely, seeing whatever his guide-book points out to him, and jotting down all those obvious and common-place remarks which everybody makes in ordinary conversation. The other rushes from London to the mountains of Central Europe as fast and as cheaply as steam can take him, and then, with staff and knapsack, plunges into their defiles. It is good that elderly and well-to-do gentlemen should make tours </p><p>* Sight-seeing in Germany and the Tyrol in the Autumn of 1855. By Sir John Forbes. London: Smith, Elder, and Co.</p><p> On Foot through Tyrol in the Summer of 1855. By Walter White. London: Chapman and Hall.</p><p>in Germany, thus spending their money sensibly, and getting in exchange for it some new ideas; and it is good that young men should shake off the trammels of business, and gain health among fresh breezes and clear streams; but it is not good that these same persons should come home and publish books about the places through which they have passed, containing scarcely a single scrap of knowledge which was not long ago familiar to instructed, and easily accessible to uninstructed, men. Neither of these authors appears now for the first time before the public. We are not acquainted with their former works; but if they at all resembled their present productions, the taste of the people who liked them must be strange indeed. In the volumes under review, we find hardly anything to amuse, and little to instruct. Yet such books are bought by the libraries, and read, and praised. For the benefit, then, of those who have not the courage to wait till they "blow over," we proceed to give a short account of their contents. </p><p>Sir John Forbes left England in the end of July, 1855, and travelled over the whole of Germany. We cannot attempt to follow him through the length and breadth of the land, but a specimen taken at random will show the sort of intellectual fare which he thinks good enough for the English public. His account of Dresden occupies eight pages. He thought that city inferior in neatness and splendour to Berlin, and surpassed in picturesqueness by Leipsie and Halle. It has, however, he says, "redeeming points of beauty." The old bridge is a "handsome structure," and the Bruhl terrace is a "charming locality," more especially on a fine evening. He was, however, disgusted by the "eternal smoking of the people." The population of Dresden is next given; and then we are told that its "sights are not very numerous, but some of them of great interest." The Catholic church and the Frauenkirche "are both of great beauty in their respective styles." "The King’s palace is a fine massive building, but without beauty." The Zwinger has nine lines devoted to it. The Orangerie has two. The Opera-house has a short paragraph. The Gallery has about a page. The Green Vaults have two paragraphs, and other miscellaneous collections have about two pages more. There is not, in Sir John’s whole account of one of the most interesting capitals in the world, one line or one word which any decently-educated boy of sixteen might not have written. So it is with his description of Vienna, Pesth, and every other place which he visits. We carry away from the perusal of this volume one new fact which, if true, we care to remember--and one only. It is this:--Most people believe the Ilz, which joing the Danube at Passau, to be black--Sir John Forbes says it is not black. If he is right, let him have the credit of the discovery; but our eyes, and those of many other people, have reported it black as ink. Even if Sir John's views on the subject be correct, they hardly repay us for reading a volume of nearly 400 pages. </p><p>Sir John Forbes must surely know that this book is merely Murray and platitudes from beginning to end. What possible purpose can he hope to effect by it? He makes, to be sure, no great pretensions; but why should he write at all? Does not every Englishman on the Continent carry a red book? And is not that red book far more copious in its details, and far more interesting, than the work he has now given us? If he must write travels, why does he not take the trouble to learn something new about the countries which he visits? Sir John Forbes went to Berlin. If he felt a call to tell this to all mankind, why did he not stay long enough to learn a little about the present state of things in that city? He might have mingled with the people, and, without betraying confidence, have told us something about the state of politics and parties. He might have attended the numerous churches, and given us some details of the various shades of religious opinion now prevailing in the great Protestant State of the Continent. He might have made excursions in the neighbourhood of the Prussian capital, and have mentioned the plants he found, and the birds he saw. He might have found out what new German and foreign books were most popular, what pamphlets were most read, what progress social reforms were making. He might have studied the local papers, and collected opinions about our doings in the East. On these and a hundred other subject, intelligent persons in this country would be glad of a little information. On every one of them it is easy to get copious and accurate information on the spot, and it is incredibly difficult to get any information here. But all this would take time, and require a little arrangement; and Sir John, in the proud consciousness of having attained the dignity of being called, in the slang of English tourists in Switzerland, “the wrong Forbes,” throws this book to the reading multitude. He has selected as a motto for it--</p><p>	Ich singe wie der Vogel singt,</p><p>	Der in den Zweigen wobnet,</p><p>	Das Lied das aus der Rehlc dringt,</p><p>	Ist Lohn der rcichlich lohnet.</p><p>We would suggest a more appropriate one: “Populus vult decipi, et decipiatur.” As long as men and women will read trash, there will always be a good supply of it. </p><p>When the sins of a book are those of commission, there is some pleasure in criticizing it; but when what offends us is rather the utter absence of merit than the presence of faults, it is quite otherwise. In such cases, however, the duty of saying exactly what we think is more than ever incumbent on us. Many of our contemporaries, glad to escape from the respectable stolidity of Sir John Forbes, will pass his book by with a few civil words; and in a year or two will be born a volume of Sight-seeing in Italy, in wich we shall be told--"At Florence, in an apartment called the Tribune, there are several fine works of art"--and "The King of Napes, as a man and as a ruler, has some defect." We long, when reading Sir John's weary pages, for even a little well-sounding nonsense. A celebrated critic, now dead, was once asked why he admitted into a review conducted by him, a number of articles, the style of which was much better than the matter. "It is true," he said, "they teach nothing, they mean nothing, they are nothing, but they go down like bottle velvet." Sir John Forbes has made a book which is not more instructive than the articles in question, and which wants their one merit. </p><p>Mr. White, our other traveler, departed from London in July, 1855, and journeyed rapidly, by Antwrp and the Rhine, to Stuttgardt and the Lake of Constance. Embarking at Friedrichshafen, he steamed to Bregenz, where, passport regulations having been duly complied with he entered the Vorarlberg. His first adventure was a fire at Hohenems, which he describes at some length. Passing by Bludenz, he crossed the Tyrolese frontier, chronicling as he went along such small facts as what he paid for breakfast, dinner, and bed--how the peasant salute him--how the Austrian police officials were puzzled by his wandering in those remote parts. Now and then he came to places famous in the wars, where the mountaineers had followed the old example of Morgarten, and attacked their enemies while entangled in the ravines. At one point, he was asked by some laborers for news from the Crimea. “Was it true that the Russians had landed in England?” His answer, “Not true, nor likely to be,” called forth a general “So it yet goes well.” Further on, he found terrible marks of the tremendous inundation of the early summer of last year. On the Stelvio, he talks with two Austrian officers:-- </p><p>“What did the English nation generally think of Kossuth and Mazzini? To harbor such ‘miserables’ was disgraceful. What did it mean?” </p><p>I replied--“To be able to believe what it means you must go and live in England. We love our own rights and liberties too well to endanger them by expelling fugitives who respect their asylum.” </p><p>Then--“Did we mean to take Sebastopol?” </p><p>“Of course we do. When the British lion makes up his mind to do a thing, he does it. His mind is made up to take Sebastopol, and take it he will.” </p><p>"We shall see," they retorted, with a laugh. </p><p>We have seen. </p><p>Whether Mr. White was technically correct in the answer he gave when asked about Kossuth and Mazzini, is a question which we leave to jurists. If he had been more learned, he might very possibly have been less intelligible. </p><p>Here is a little picture, rather shocking, but too characteristic of the Austrian Alps to be passed by. At Markt-Mals is a fountain which </p><p>Exhibits a strange combination of the useful with the sacred: behind the trough stands a life-size Christ, wanting the legs, pouring out a stream of water from an iron pipe inserted in its left side, at which a boy was drinking. Here women come to fill their buckets, and wayfarers and cattle to quench their thirst; and under the circumstances, there seemed to me a risk of that familiarity which breeds contempt. In another street the tall cross bore the Virgin, in addition to its usual burden, with seven daggers sticking in her heart. </p><p>From Bormio, on the southern side of the Stelvio, Mr. White pushed on towards Trent, crossing the Gavia with some trouble. At Trent he found most of the booksellers’ shops full of devotional books, but was surprised to see an Italian translation of the first two volumes of Macaulay’s History of England. He had a conversation with a captain of gensdarmes at Kaltern, who labored much to convince him that things in Austria were not as bad as we are accustomed to believe. Amongst other arguments, he brought forward the well-known loyalty of the Tyrolese and said that these enthusiastic mountaineers had in 1848 used an effigy of Lord Palmerston as a target. The inscription might have been written by Mr. Urquhart-- </p><p>	If the devil has a son,</p><p>	Sure he is Lord Palmerston.</p><p>This is pretty well, but the rage of the peasantry is emulated by their superiors. The following description of the Premier is from the pen of a man who was long one of the most conspicuous politicians in Austria. In a pamphlet published only a few months ago, Count Ficquelmont writes of Lord Palmerston as follows:-- </p><p>Moderne Catilina, de belles manieres, de moeurs contenues, de fortune rangee, courtisan du peuple sans etre son tribun, n’ayant q’une seule et meme ritournelle pour toutes ses oraisons, ce n’est ni la puissance de la parole ni la hauteur des idees qui lui out donnee le pouvoir. Lord Palmerston regne cependant, mais il regne au moyen de l’excitation des passions. </p><p>From Meran, Mr. White proceeded to the Passeyr-thal and visited the birthplace of Hofer, whose adventures, as well as those of Spechbacher and Haspinger, he sketches with some cleverness. Crossing the Jauffur, he fell into the Brenner route and arrived at Innsbruck, where he saw the tomb of Maximilian and other usual sights. Thence he made his way to the Bavarian border and returned to the shores of the Lake of Constance. Steamboat and diligence brought him to Schaffhausen. After seeing the Falls of the Rhine, he walked through the Black Forest to Freyburg, and reached England by Strasbourg, Paris, and Dieppe--having travelled “more than two thousand miles, of which four hundred and twenty were on foot, at a cost, including everything, of less than fourteen pounds.” Long may Mr. White live to make pleasant summer tours at such a small expense; but, we do trust we may never again read the record of any one of them. Three hundred pages, in which there is certainly little to blame, but also scarcely anything to praise or remember, is sadly dull work.</p><p>If the peine forte et dure of reading one or the other of the books before us must inevitably be undergone, we strongly recommend Mr. White’s. It is the shorter of the two, and although its author is very slenderly provided with the knowledge that enables a traveler to see anything worth reporting, he at least trusts his own eyes and does not merely recast Murray. </p><p>BELLES LETTRES (POETRY REVIEW, OCTOBER 1856). </p><p>EVERY reader of Lessing's "Laokoon" remembers his masterly distinction between the methods of presentation in poetry and the plastic arts—the acumen and the aptness of illustration with which he shows how the difference in the materials wherewith the poet and painter or sculptor respectively work, and the difference in their mode of appeal to the mind, properly involve a difference in their treatment of a given subject. Virgil adds to the effect of his description by making his Laocoon shriek with agony; the words, clamores horrendos ad sidera tollit, do not suggest a distorted mouth, but simply intensify in our imagination the conception of suffering. But the sculptor did not attempt to render this detail, because he could have given us nothing else than the distorted mouth, which would merely have been rigid ugliness, exciting in us no tragic emotion. And the same fine instinct which has here guided the sculptor to adifferent method of treatment from that of the epic poet, is needed in the dramatist. "It is one thing," says Lessing, "to be told that some one shrieked, and another to hear the shriek itself." The narrative is a suggestion, and addresses the imagination only; but the dramatic representation attacks the sense. On the other hand, the poet would be under an equal mistake if he adopted all the symbolism and detail of the painter and sculptor, since he has at his command the media of speech and action, and it is the absence of these which their symbolism is intended to supply. </p><p>This reference to the "Laokoon" has been prompted by Mr. Dobell's new volume of poems, "England in Time of War."¹ In certain </p><p>¹ "England in Time of War." By Sydney Dobell, Author of "Balder," and "The Roman." London; Smith and Elder. </p><p>peculiarities of these poems we see something analogous to that mistake of confounding the methods proper to distinct arts, against which Lessing directs his trenchant arguments. Almost every critic has noticed, and noticed in order to condemn, the extravagance with which the author uses that device of iteration which, under proper restraint, forms the delicately-shaded boundary where lyric poetry melts into music proper. What ear has not delighted in that refrain of Tennyson's:— </p><p>"Blow, bugles, blow, set the wild echoes flying, </p><p>And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying!"? </p><p>Here is the song of speech in its utmost legitimate affinity with the song of pure sound; just indicating that surplus of sensation and emotion which transcends the power of articulate language and awaits its full expression in music. But Mr. Dobell's iteration, instead of escaping him as an inevitable climax, is an elaborate appliance by which he undertakes to make words perform the functions of musical notes; and he sometimes even surpasses in monotony the "burthen" of the early English and Scottish ballads. For example, we have more than a page of stanzas varying no more from each other than the two following:—</p><p>"On the wold, the wold, </p><p>Oh the wold, the wold! </p><p>Oh the winter stark, </p><p>Oh the level dark </p><p>On the wold, the wold, the wold! </p><p>"Oh the wold, the wold, </p><p>Oh the wold, the wold! </p><p>Oh the mystery </p><p>Of the blasted tree </p><p>On the wold, the wold, the wold!" </p><p>Iteration is a necessity to the primitive mind, because there is no other resource for the expression of persistent emotion; thought or art is not yet complex enough to clothe the same feeling in a perpetually varied form. But under a condition of high culture, this primitive monotony becomes intolerable; and when a modern writer recurs to it, the only impression he is likely to produce on his readers is, that he is inadequate to the expression of his idea through his proper medium of thought-suggesting speech, and that, unable to attain an effect by genuine art, he resorts to a mere trick; as angry people who are unable to say cutting things, fall to making faces. But Mr. Dobell gives too many proofs of power for us to attribute this practice of iteration to the negative cause of incompetence, so we must conclude it to be one of those perversities or idiosyncrasies which have condemned the productions of many a man of genius to be the predilection of the few, instead of being the delight of the many. A kindred perversity is his frequent preference of the obscure and far-fetched to that large simplicity of expression and imagery which he occasionally shows us that he can command. These are the reasons why many uncritical readers, after trying several of the poems, lay down his book with baffled weariness; and why supercilious critics, after picking out a few extravagances, treat it  </p><p>[Vol. LXVI. No. CXXX.]—NEW SERIES, Vol. X. No. II. PP </p><p>with unmeasured scorn. But reviewers who pronounce "England in Time of War" a worthless or contemptible book, and who rank Mr. Dobell among the poetasters that mistake incoherence for inspiration, remind us of the worthy magistrate in "Peveril of the Peak," who wields his "Protestant flail " with immense force only to bring it round with a tremendous thump on his own skull. We are not enthusiastic admirers either of Mr. Dobell or of the school of poetry to which he belongs, but we can at least see that he is a man of deep thought and sensibility, essentially a poet, and earnest though aberrant in the pursuit of his art;—in fact, a man who is not to be extinguished either by Mr. Gillillan's praise or Mr. Gigadibs' condemnation. </p><p>"England in Time of War" is a series of lyrics, representing the emotions of those who are left at home to bear the passive sorrows of war, and of those who go out to brave its active perils. It is the story of the war told, not in its outward events, but in the mental experience of the men and women who are actors and sufferers in it. We have English life in all its grades, from Lady Constance, who muses on— </p><p>	"Her love, her lord,</p><p>Leaning so grandly on his jewelled sword," </p><p>to the milkmaid whose Harry is a likely lad to "go a sodgering." We have lyrical strains varying in loftiness from a Miltonic "Prayer of the Understanding," to the simple pathos of the old farmer's lament—</p><p>"'Tis a poor world, this, boys, </p><p>And Tommy's dead." </p><p>In many of the poems which represent peasant life, Mr. Dobell has employed the Lowland Scotch as, in his opinion, the most typical and poetical Doric; but probably the readers who will sympathise with his admiration for this dialect will be in the minority; and if we wanted proof that no dialect is necessary for suggesting to the imagination the peculiar turn and flavour of uncultured thought and feeling, we might adduce the poem just referred to, "Tommy's dead." </p><p>Much of the writing in this volume, we confess, makes us impatient; it is sometimes eccentric and puerile, sometimes enigmatic—capricious ingenuity which puzzles our intellect, not poetry which coerces our souls. But we have never turned over two or three pages in irritation without being arrested by some passage of simple pathos, or of exquisite rhythmic melody laden with fresh and felicitous thought. Here is a father mourning over his son:— </p><p>"Aye, where art thou? Men, tell me of a fame </p><p>Walking the wondering nations; and they say, </p><p>When thro' the shouting people thy great name </p><p>Goes, like a chief upon a battle-day, </p><p>They shake the heavens with glory. Well-away! </p><p>"As some poor hound that thro' thronged street and square </p><p>Pursues his loved lost lord, and fond and fast </p><p>Seeks what he feels to be but feels not where, </p><p>Tracks the dear feet to some closed door at last, </p><p>And lies him down and lornest looks doth cast,—. </p><p>"So I, thro' all the long tumultuous days, </p><p>Tracing thy footstep on the human sands, </p><p>O'er the signed deserts and the vocal ways </p><p>Pursue thee, faithful, thro' the echoing lands, Wearing a wandering staff with trembling hands: </p><p>"Thro' echoing lands that ring with victory, </p><p>And answer for the living with the dead, </p><p>And give me marble when I ask for bread, </p><p>And give me glory when I ask for thee— </p><p>It was not glory I nursed on my knee." </p><p>A more sunny picture is "Afloat and Ashore," where we have a the wife coming to meet the husband. We can only quote the latter half:— </p><p>"I have come down to thee coming to me, love. </p><p>I stand, I stand </p><p>On the solid sand, </p><p>I see thee coming to me, love. </p><p>The sea runs up to me on the sand, </p><p>I start—'tis as if thou hadst stretched thine hand </p><p>And touched me thro' the sea, love. </p><p>I feel as if I must die, </p><p>For there's something longs to fly, </p><p>Fly and fly, to thee, love. </p><p>As the blood of the flower ere she blows </p><p>Is beating up to the sun, </p><p>And her roots do hold her down,</p><p>And it blushes and breaks undone </p><p>In a rose, </p><p>So my blood is beating in me, love! </p><p>I see thee nigh and nigher, </p><p>And my soul leaps up like sudden fire, </p><p>My life's in the air </p><p>To meet thee there, </p><p>To meet thee coming to me, love! </p><p>Over the sea, </p><p>Coming to me, </p><p>Coming, and coming to me, love! </p><p>"The boats are lowered: I leap in first, </p><p>Pull, boys, pull! or my heart will burst! </p><p>More! more!—lend me an oar!— </p><p>I'm thro' the breakers! I'm on the shore! </p><p>I see thee waiting for me, love! </p><p>"A sudden storm </p><p>Of sighs and tears, </p><p>A clenching arm, </p><p>A look of years. </p><p>In my bosom a thousand cries </p><p>A flash like light before my eyes, </p><p>And I am lost in thee, love!" </p><p>The poem called "Home, wounded!" has more of the author's peculiar manner: the iteration is abundant, but less offensive than elsewhere; and we think the whole poem at once original and beautiful. The maimed hero, now in the shelter of his English home, is being wheeled out by his brother in the sunshine, talking, meanwhile, of the favourite old spots where he should like to be taken, and giving vent to his sense of repose arising from the thought that his work done— </p><p>"And all the tedious tasked toil of the difficult long endeavour </p><p>Solved and quit by no more fine </p><p>Than these limbs of mine." </p><p>Here is a fragment of the poem:— </p><p>"—oh, to sit here thus in the sun, </p><p>To sit here, feeling my work is done, </p><p>While the sands of life so golden run, </p><p>And I watch the children's posies, </p><p>And my idle heart is whispering </p><p>'Bring whatever the years may bring, </p><p>The flowers will blossom the birds will sing, </p><p>And there'll always be primroses.' </p><p> * * * * * *</p><p>"My soul lies out like a basking hound, </p><p>A hound that dreams and dozes; </p><p>Along my life my length I lay, </p><p>I fill to-morrow and yesterday, </p><p>I am warm with the suns that have long since set, </p><p>I am warm with the summers that are not yet, </p><p>And like one who dreams and dozes </p><p>Two worlds are whispering over me, </p><p>From the backward shore to the shore before, </p><p>From the shore before to the backward shore,</p><p>And like two clouds that meet and pour </p><p>Each thro' each, till core in core </p><p>A single self reposes, </p><p>The nevermore with the evermore </p><p>Above me mingles and closes; </p><p>As my soul lies out like the basking hound, </p><p>And wherever it lies seems happy ground, </p><p>And when, awakened by some sweet sound, </p><p>A dreamy eye uncloses, </p><p>I see a blooming world around, </p><p>And I lie amid primroses— </p><p>Years of sweet primroses, </p><p>Springs of fresh primroses, </p><p>Springs to be, and springs for me </p><p>Of distant dim primroses." </p><p>We have three other volumes of recent verse before us. The best is "St. Bartholomew's Day, and other Poems,"2—unaffected, and not ungraceful. The Rev. Archer Gurney's "Songs of Early Summer"3 are robustly commonplace, like a bed of marigolds; and Mrs. Machell's </p><p>2 "St. Bartholomew's Day, and other Poems." By Stewart Lockyer. London: Saunders and Otley. </p><p>3 " Songs of Early Summer." By the Rev. Archer Gurney.

We confess that these modern verses have not tempted us to linger so long over them as the selection of "Early Ballads"5 edited by Mr. Bell—a well-chosen selection, both for interest and variety. "The old chivalry of the Marches," says the editor, "is here amply reflected. The ancient love-ballad has its popular representative; the legends of the Round Table contribute a snatch of characteristic lore; Robin Hood and Little John are exhibited under their greenwood tree, and in some of their lawless exploits; the traditions of the feuds and raids of the North, and the local tales which re-people many an ancient fortress and crumbling min are abundantly scattered through our pages." Clearly, a very acceptable addition to the series of slim and easily legible volumes forming the "Annotated Edition of the English Poets." </p><p>At length we have Mrs. Stowe's new novel,6 and for the last three weeks there have been men, women, and children reading it with rapt attention laughing and sobbing over it—lingering with delight over its exquisite landscapes, its scenes of humour, and tenderness, and rude heroism—and glowing with indignation at its terrible representation of chartered barbarities. Such a book is an uncontrollable power, and critics who follow it with their objections and reservations—who complain that Mrs. Stowe's plot is defective, that she has repeated herself, that her book is too long and too full of hymns and religious dialogue, and that it creates an unfair bias are something like men pursuing a prairie fire with desultory watering-cans. In the meantime, "Dred" will be devoured by the million, who carry no critical talisman against the enchantments of genius. We confess ourselves to be among the million, and quite unfit to rank with the sage minority of Fadladeens. We have been too much moved by "Dred" to determine with precision how far it is inferior to "Uncle Tom;" too much impressed by what Mrs. Stowe has done to be quite sure that we can tell her what she ought to have done. Our admiration of the book is quite distinct from any opinions or hesitations we may have as to the terribly difficult problems of Slavery and Abolition—problems which belong to quite other than "polite literature." Even admitting Mrs. Stowe to be mistaken in her views, and partial or exaggerated in her representations, "Dred" remains not the less a novel inspired by a rare genius—rare both in intensity and in range of power.</p><p>Looking at the matter simply from an artistic point of view, we see no reason to regret that Mrs. Stowe should keep to her original ground of negro and planter life, any more than that Scott should have introduced Highland life into "Rob Roy" and "The Fair Maid </p><p>4 "Poems and Translations."

Mrs. Stowe has invented the Negro novel, and it is a novel not only fresh in its scenery and its manners, but possessing that conflict of races which Augustin Thierry has pointed out as the great source of romantic interest—witness "Ivanhoe." Inventions in literature are not as plentiful as inventions in the paletôt and waterproof department, and it is rather amusing that we reviewers, who have, for the most part, to read nothing but imitations of imitations, should put on airs of tolerance towards Mrs. Stowe because she has written a second Negro novel, and make excuses for her on the ground that she perhaps would not succeed in any other kind of fiction. Probably she would not; for her genius seems to be of a very special character: her "Sunny Memories" were as feeble as her novels are powerful. But whatever else she may write, or may not write, "Uncle Tom" and "Dred" will assure her a place in that highest rank of novelists who can give us a national life in all its phases—popular and aristocratic, humorous and tragic, political and religious. </p><p>But Mrs. Stowe's novels have not only that grand element—conflict of races; they have another element equally grand, which she also shares with Scott, and in which she has, in some respects, surpassed him. This is the exhibition of a people to whom what we may call Hebraic Christianity is still a reality, still an animating belief, and by whom the theocratic conceptions of the Old Testament are literally applied to their daily life. Where has Scott done anything finer than the character of Balfour of Burley, the battles of Drumclog and Bothwell Brigg, and the trial of Ephraim MacBriar? And the character of Dred, the death scenes in the Swamp, and the Camp Meeting of Presbyterians and Methodists, will bear comparison if we except the fighting—with the best parts of "Old Mortality." The strength of Mrs. Stowe's own religious feeling is a great artistic advantage to her here; she never makes you feel that she is coldly calculating an effect, but you see that she is all a-glow for the moment with the wild enthusiasm, the unreasoning faith, and the steady martyr-spirit of Dred, of Tiff, or of Father Dickson. But with this, she has the keen sense of humour which preserves her from extravagance and monotony; and though she paints her religious negroes en beau, they are always specifically negroes—she never loses hold of her characters, and lets dramatic dialogue merge into vague oratory. Indeed, here is her strongest point: her dramatic instinct is always awake; and whether it is the grotesque Old Tiff or the aerial Nina, the bluff sophist Father Bonim or the gentlemanly sophist Frank Russell, her characters are always like themselves; a quality which is all the more remarkable in novels animated by a vehement polemieal purpose. </p><p>The objection which is patent to every one who looks at Mrs. Stowe's novels in an argumentative light, is also, we think, one of their artistic defects; namely, the absence of any proportionate exhibition of the negro character in its less amiable phases. Judging from her pictures, one would conclude that the negro race was vastly superior to the mass of whites, even in other than slave countries—a state of the case which would singularly defeat Mrs. Stowe's sarcasms on the cant of those who call Slavery a "Christianizing Institution." If the negroes are really so very good, slavery has answered as moral discipline. But apart from the argumentative suicide involved in this one-sidedness, Mrs. Stowe loses by it the most terribly tragic element in the relation of the two races—the Nemesis lurking in the vices of the oppressed. She alludes to demoralization among the slaves, but she does not depict it; and yet why should she shrink from this, since she does not shrink from giving us a full-length portrait of a Legree or a Tom Gordon?</p><p>It would be idle to tell anything about the story of a work which is, or soon will be, in all our readers' hands; we only render our tribute to it as a great novel, leaving to others the task of weighing it in the political balance. </p><p>Close upon "Dred" we have read Mr. Charles Reade's novel—"It is Never Too Late to Mend;"7 also a remarkable fiction, and one that sets vibrating very deep chords in our nature, yet presenting a singular contrast with "Dred," both in manner and in the essential qualities it indicates in the writer. Mr. Reade's novel opens with some of the true pathos to be found in English country life: the honest young farmer, George Fielding, unable to struggle against "bad times" and an exhausted farm, is driven to Australia to seek the fortune that will enable him to marry Susan Merton, the woman he loves. It then carries us, with a certain Robinson, a clever thief, who has been rusticating as George Fielding's lodger, to the gaol, and makes us shudder at the horrors of the separate and silent system, administered by an ignorant and brutal gaoler, while we follow with keen interest the struggle of the heroic chaplain against this stupid iniquity—thus bringing home the tragedy of Birmingham gaol to people whose sympathies are more easily roused by fiction than by bare fact. Then it takes us to Australia, and traces George Fielding's fortunes and misfortunes—first through the vicissitudes of the Australian "sheep-run," and then through the fierce drama of gold-digging—bringing him home at last with four thousand pounds in his pocket, in time to prevent his Susan from marrying his worst enemy. </p><p>In all the three "acts" of this novel, so to speak, there are fine situations, fine touches of feeling, and much forcible writing; especially while the scene is in the Gaol, the best companion who drops in you will probably regard as a bore, and will become earnest in inviting to remain only when you perceive he is determined to go. Again, honest George Fielding's struggles, renewed at the antipodes, and lightened by the friendship of Carlo the dog—of the reformed thief, Robinson—and of the delightful "Jacky," the Australian native— are a thread of interest which you pursue with eagerness to the dénouement. "Jacky" is a thoroughly fresh character, entirely unlike any other savage frotté d6 civilisation, and drawn with exquisite yet sober humour. In the English scenes every one who has seen anything of life amongst our farmers will recognise many truthful, well-observed touches: the little "tiff" between the brothers George </p><p>7 "It is Never Too Late to Mend." A Matter of Fact Romance. By Charles Reade. In Three Vols. Bentley. </p><p>and William Fielding, old Merton's way of thinking, and many traits of manner in the heroine, Susan Merton. In short, "It is Never Too Late to Mend" is one of the exceptional novels to be read not merely by the idle and the half-educated, but by the busy and the thoroughly informed </p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Reade's novel does not rise above the level of cleverness: we feel throughout the presence of remarkable talent, which makes effective use of materials, but nowhere of the genius which absorbs material, and reproduces it as a living whole, in which you do not admire the ingenuity of the workman, but the vital energy of the producer. Doubtless there is a great deal of nonsense talked about genius and inspiration, as if genius did not and must not labour; but, after all, there remains the difference between the writer who thoroughly possesses you by his creation, and the writer who only awakens your curiosity and makes you recognise his ability; and this difference may as well be called " genius " as anything else. Perhaps a truer statement of the difference is, that the one writer is himself thoroughly possessed by his creation—he lives in his characters; while the other remains outside them, and dresses them up. Here lies the fundamental contrast between Mrs. Stowe's novel and Mr. Reade's. Mrs. Stowe seems for the moment to glow with all the passion, to quiver with all the fun, and to be inspired with all the trust that belong to her different characters; she attains her finest dramatic effects by means of her energetic sympathy, and not by conscious artifice. Mr. Reade, on the contrary, seems always self-conscious, always elaborating a character after a certain type, and carrying his elaboration a little too far—always working up to situations, and over-doing them. The habit of writing for the stage misleads him into seeking after those exaggerated contrasts and effects which are accepted as a sort of rapid symbolism by a theatrical audience, but are utterly out of place in a fiction, where the time and means for attaining a result are less limited, and an impression of character or purpose may be given more nearly as it is in real life—by a sum of less concentrated particulars. In Mr. Reade's dialogue we are constantly imagining that we see a theatrical gentleman, well "made-up," delivering a repartee in an emphatic voice, with his eye fixed on the pit. To mention one brief example:—Hawes, the gaoler, tells Fry, the turnkey, after Mr. Eden's morning sermon on theft, that he approves of preaching at people. The same day there is an afternoon sermon on cruelty; whereupon Hawes remarks again to Fry, "I'll teach him to preach at people from the pulpit." "Well," answers Fry, "that is what I say, Sir: but you said you liked him to preach at folk?" "So I do," replied Hawes, angrily, "but not at me, ye fool!" This would produce a roar on the stage, and would seem a real bit of human nature; but in a novel one has time to be sceptical as to this extreme naïveté which allows a man to make palpable epigrams on himself.</p><p>In everything, Mr. Reade seems to distrust the effect of moderation and simplicity. His picture of gaol life errs by excess, and he wearies our emotion by taxing it too repeatedly; the admirable inspiration which led him to find his hero and heroine among Berkshire homesteads, is counteracted by such puerile and incongruous efforts at the romantic and diabolical, as the introduction of the Jew, Isaac Levi, who is a mosaic character in more senses than one, and the far-seeing Machiavelianism of the top—booted Mr. Meadows; and even when he is speaking in his own person, he lashes himself into fury at human wrongs, and calls on God and man to witness his indignation, apparently confounding the importance of the effect with the importance of the cause. But the most amazing foible in a writer of so much power as Mr. Reade, is his reliance on the magic of typography. We had imagined that the notion of establishing a relation between magnitude of ideas and magnitude of type was confined to the literature of placards, but we find Mr. Reade endeavouring to impress us with the Titanic character of modern events by suddenly bursting into capitals at the mention of "THIS GIGANTIC AGE!" It seems ungrateful in us to notice these minor blemishes in a work which has given us so much pleasure, and roused in us so much healthy feeling as "It is Never Too Late to Mend;" but it is our very admiration of Mr. Reade's talent which makes these blemishes vexatious to us, and which induces us to appeal against their introduction in the many other books we hope to have from his pen. </p><p>Another novel by a writer whose books are justly opened with agreeable expectations, is "Young Singleton."8 The conception of this novel—the idea of tracing the operation of morbid vanity in an impressionable nature of mixed English and Hindoo blood, from boyhood to maturity—is fresh and excellent. The unheroic hero is introduced to us in his small "skeleton" jacket and trousers, newly sent from India by his father the Nabob, under the care of a Hindoo servant, and we see him through his career at school and college, and as heir of his father's wealth, always the victim of the uneasy vanity that craves distinction just where Nature has denied it, hating all who consciously or unconsciously thwart this vanity, and inwardly flinging at them the anathema of his childhood, "You are nasty things, and I hate you;" till at last a moment of temptation reveals the terrible possibilities of crime that lie in the indulgence of trivial egoism, and, to avenge his galled vanity, he allows his best friend to drown when he might save him by stretching out his hand. Throughout the novel the situations are at once striking and natural, and the characters are all specific; yet, notwithstanding these merits, it does not impress us as a success. The outline is vigorous, but the filling up-is often feeble; the story shows a power of construction without an adequate power of detail, and it reminds us of a play schemed by an able dramatist but written by an inefficient collaborator.</p><p>The appearance of a new novel by Miss Bremer,9 revives the impressions of ten years ago, when all the novel-reading world was dis­ </p><p>8 "Young Singleton." By Talbot Gwynne. In Two Volumes. London: Smith and Elder. </p><p>9 " Hertha." By Frederika Bremer. Translated by Mary Howitt. London: Hall, Virtue, and Co. </p><p>cussing the merits of "The Neighbours," "The President's Daughters," " The H- Family," and the rest of the "Swedish novels," which about that time were creating a strong current in the literary and bookselling world. The discussion soon died out; and perhaps there is hardly another instance of fictions so eagerly read in England which have left so little trace in English literature as Miss Bremer's. No one quotes them, no one alludes to them: and grave people who have entered on their fourth decade, remember their enthusiasm for the Swedish novels among those intellectual "wild oats" to which their mature wisdom can afford to give a pitying smile. And yet, how is this? For Miss Bremer had not only the advantage of describing manners which were fresh to the English public; she also brought to the description unusual gifts—lively imagination, poetic feeling, wealth of language, a quick eye for details, and considerable humour, of that easy, domestic kind which throws a pleasant light on every-day things. The perusal of "Hertha" has confirmed in our minds the answer we should have previously given to our own question. One reason, we think, why Miss Bremer's novels have not kept a high position among us is, that her luxuriant faculties are all overrun by a rank growth of sentimentality, which, like some faint-smelling creeper on the boughs of an American forest, oppresscs us with the sense that the air is unhealthy. Nothing can be more curious than the combination in her novels of the vapourishly affected and unreal with the most solid Dutch sort of realism. In one page we have copious sausage sandwiches and beer posset, and on another rhapsodies or wildly improbable incidents that seem rather to belong to sylphs and salamanders, than to a race of creatures who are nourished by the very excellent provisions just mentioned. Another reason why Miss Bremer's novels are not likely to take rank among the permanent creations of art, is the too confident tone of the religious philosophy which runs through them. When a novelist is quite sure that she has a theory which suffices to illustrate all the difficulties of our earthly existence, her novels are too likely to illustrate little else than her own theory. </p><p>These two characteristics of sentimentality and dogmatic confidence are very strongly marked in "Hertha," while it has less of the attention to detail, less of the humorous realism, which was the ballast of Miss Bremer's earlier novels. It has been written not simply from an artistic impulse, but with the object of advocating the liberation of woman from those legal and educational restrictions which limit her opportunities of a position and a sphere of usefulness to the chance of matrimony; and we think there are few well-judging persons who will not admire the generous energy with which Miss Bremer, having long ago won fame and independence for herself, devotes the activity of her latter years to the cause of women who are less capable of mastering circumstance. Many wise and noble things she says in "Hertha," but we cannot help regretting that she has not presented her views on a difficult and practical question in the "light of common day," rather than in the pink haze of visions and romance. The story is very briefly this:—</p><p>Hertha, who has lost her mother in childhood, is, at the age of seven-and-twenty, becoming more and more embittered by her inactive bondage to a narrow-minded, avaricious father, who demands obedience to the pettiest exactions. Her elder sister, Alma, is slowly dying in consequence of the same tyranny, which has prevented her from marrying the man she loves. We meet our heroine, with her gloomy and bitter expression of face, first of all, at the rehearsal of a fancy ball, which is to take place in a few days in the good town of Kungsköping; and after being introduced to the various dramatis personæ—among the rest, to a young man named Yngve Nordin, who interests Hertha by his agreement in her opinions about women, we accompany her to her cheerless home, where she is roughly chid by her father, the rigid old Director, for being later than the regulation-hour of eight; and where, by the bedside of her sister Alma, she pours out all the bitterness of her soul, all her hatred and smothered rebellion towards her father for his injustice towards them. She and Alma have inherited a share in their mother's fortune, but according to the Swedish law they are still minors, and unable to claim their property. This very night, however, a fire breaks out, and lays waste a large district of the town. The Director's house is consumed, and he himself is only saved by the heroic exertions of Hertha, who rushes to his room, and carries his meagre, feeble body through the flames. This act of piety, and the death of Alma, who, in her last moments, extracts from her father a promise to give Hertha independence, win some ungracious concessions from the crabbed Director towards his daughter. He still withholds her property and a declaration of her majority; but she has power in the household, and greater freedom of action out of doors. A Ladies' Society has been organized for relieving the sufferers from the fire, and Hertha is one of those whose department is the care of the sick and wounded. The patient who falls to her share is no other than Yngve Nordin, who has been severely hurt in his benevolent efforts on the fatal night, and is now lodged in. the house of the good pastor, who is at the head of the "Society." Here is an excellent opportunity for discovering that Yngve is just the friend she needs to soothe and invigorate her mind, by his sympathy and riper experience; and the feeling which is at first called friendship, is at last confessed to be love. After certain jealousies and suspicions, which are satisfactorily cleared up, Yngve asks the Director for Hertha's hand, but is only accepted prospectively, on condition of his attaining an assured position. Yngve goes abroad, and for seven years Hertha submits to the procrastination of her marriage, rather than rebel-against her father in his last years. It is only when Yngve is hopelessly ill that she sacrifices her scruples and marries him. In the mean time she has made her seven years of separation rich in active usefulness, by founding and superintending two schools—one in which girls are in­structed in the ordinary elements of education, forming a sort of nursery-garden for the other, in which voluntary pupils are to be led to a higher order of thought and purpose by Hertha's readings, conversation, and personal influence. Her schools are successful; but after Yngve's death she begins to sink under her long trial, and follows him rapidly to the grave. </p><p>This bare outline of the story can only suggest and not fully explain the grounds of our objection to "Hertha." Our objection is, that it surrounds questions, which can only be satisfactorily solved by the application of very definite ideas to specific facts, with a cloudy kind of eloquence and flighty romance. Take, for example, the question whether it will not be well for women to study and practise medicine. It can only tend to retard the admission that women may pursue such a career with success, for a distinguished authoress to imply that they may be suitably prepared for effective activity by lectures on such a very nebulous thesis as this—"The consciousness of thought ought to be a living observation and will," or to associate the attendance of women by the sick bed, not with the hard drudgery of real practice; but with the vicissitudes of a love-story. Women have not to prove that they can be emotional, and rhapsodic, and spiritualistic; every one believes that already. They have to prove that they are capable of accurate thought, severe study, and continuous self—command. But we say all this with reluctance, and should prefer noticing the many just and pathetic observations that Miss Bremer puts into the mouth of her heroine. We can only mention, and have not space to quote, a passage where Hertha complains of the ignorance in which women are left of Natural Science. "In my youth," she concludes, "I used to look at the rocks, the trees, the grass, and all objects of nature, with unspeakable longing, wishing to know something about their kinds, their life, and their purpose. But the want of knowledge, the want of opportunity to acquire it, has caused nature to be to me a sealed book, and still to this moment it is to me a tantalizing, enticing, and ever-retreating wave, rather than a life-giving fountain which I can enjoy, and enjoying, thank the Creator."</p><p>Side by side with the latest publication of a very mature authoress, we have what may possibly be the first publication of a young authoress. If so, "Erlesmere"¹0 is a book of remarkable promise. It bears the stamp of unusual insight and culture, and of a mind that possesses some important qualifications of the novelist. Setting aside certain awkward affectations—compound words which are innovations without being acquisitions, and which happily diminish as we advance in the book, the style is vigorous and often graceful, the dialogue easy and appropriate. The writer has a sense of character and an eye for characteristics; she knows what she means to paint, and her touches, though not always felicitous, are laid on with a firm hand. Still, "Erlesmere" is not likely to be popular, nor is it, on the whole, a good novel. The imagination of the ordinary novel-reader will not be strongly arrested at the outset; and, unhappily, it is here that he will find the affectations, or rather eccentricities of style that will probably repel him; he will be afraid that he is going to have rather too much of the priggish Emersonian Mr. Harley, and will even suspect that the authoress herself has an excessive admiration for that moderately agreeable personage; so that there is great risk of his laying down </p><p>¹0 "Erlesmere; or, Contrasts of Character." By L. S. Lavenu. London: Smith and Elder. </p><p>the first volume in discouragement before he has reached the middle. On the other hand, the novel-reader extraordinary, who is keenly alive, to every trait of originality, who detects at once the touch of the true artist, though the picture, as a whole, may be crude, will be disappointed that the writer has had recourse at last to melodramatic effects which are as hackneyed as other parts of the book are fresh and spontaneous. Nevertheless, the author of "Erlesmere" is one of that minority among novelists to whom such readers will say, "More, give me more." Her first attempt is not in itself satisfactory, but it creates a belief in her powers. </p><p>Before we quit fiction, let us mention the translation of Madame de Girardin's "Stories of an Old Maid, related to her Nephews and Nieces."¹¹ We cannot better indicate the charm of these stories than by quoting the writer's own words:— </p><p>"I do not say, as many do who have written for young folks,—'I have meditated long upon the character of children; my life has been a constant study of these interesting little creatures,'—I say nothing of the sort: I merely observe, I have been a child; and as nobody can deny me this advantage, I presume upon it to recal to my mind the emotions of that happy age, and speak to you as if I still were living in it."</p><p>The book is very elegantly got up, with abundant pictures, and is a present that we envy any aunt or uncle the pleasure of bestowing. </p><p>If any reader, tired of feverish and flaccid literature, is looking out for some cool, hard, practical sense, with the smallest possible alloy of sentiment, we can recommend to him the stout volume into which Bacon's "Essays" are swelled by Archbishop VVhately's "Annotations."¹2 If we were captiously inclined, we might complain that these annotations are so often made up of citations from the Archbishop's own writings; but a veteran writer has his privileges as well as a veteran talker who recites his own mots, or a veteran general who is a little too fond of fighting his battles "o'er again." Quite a charming quality in these annotations is their abundance of appropriate and easy illustration: a grave or difficult subject is lighted up by some ingenious analogy from common experience, or by some case in point from such books as "Sandford and Merton," or Miss Austen's novels; and the most ordinary observations or anecdotes are made fresh by novelty of application. For example:— </p><p>"Whatever a man may be, intellectually, he labours under this disadvantage if he is of low moral principle, that he knows only the weak and bad parts of human nature, and not the better. </p><p>"It was remarked by an intelligent Roman Catholic that the Confessional trains the priest to a knowledge, not of human nature, but of mental nosology. 'It may therefore qualify them,' he said, 'for the treatment of a depraved, but not of a pure mind.' </p><p>"Now, what the Confessional is to the priest, that, a knave's own heart is </p><p>¹¹ "Stories of an Old Maid, related to her Nephews and Nieces.

He is like the goats in Robinson Crusoe's island, who saw clearly everything below them, but very imperfectly what was above them, so that Robinson Crusoe could never get at them from the valleys, but when he came upon them from the hilltop, took them quite by surprise." </p><p>And here is another instance of a similar kind, à propos of Bacon's observation that "the ripeness or unripeness of the occasion must ever be well weighed:"— </p><p>"It is a common phrase with the undiscriminating advocates of delay, that 'The World is not yet ripe for such and such a measure.' But they usually forget to inquire 'Is it ripening? When, and how, is it likely to become ripe? or, Are men's minds to ripen like winter pears, merely by laying them by, and letting them alone?' </p><p>"'Time,' as Bishop Copleston has remarked, (Remains, p. 123,) 'is no agent.' When we speak of such and such changes being brought about by time, we mean in time,—by the gradual and imperceptible operation of some gentle agency. We should observe, therefore, whether there is any such agency at work, and in what direction;—whether to render a certain change more difficult or easier. If you are surrounded by the waters, and want to escape, you should observe whether the tide is flowing or ebbing. In the one case, you should at once attempt the ford, at all hazards; in the other, you have to wait patiently. And if the water be still, and neither rising nor falling, then you should consider that though there is no danger of drowning, you must remain insulated for ever, unless you can cross the ford ; and that if this is to be done at all, it may be as well done at once."</p><p>The annotator often sustains admirably the note struck by the text, in the acuteness of his practical suggestions and the causticity with which he characterizes the ordinary motives and devices of men. Thus, in the annotations on the Essay " Of Negotiating," he says,— </p><p>"In proposing any scheme, the best way is, to guard, in the first instance, against cavils or details, and establish, first, that some thing of such and such a character is desirable; then proceeding to settle each of the particular points of detail, one by one. And this is the ordinary course of experienced men; who, as it were, cut a measure into mouthfuls, that it may be the more readily swallowed; dividing the whole measure into a series of resolutions; each of which will perhaps pass by a large majority, though the whole at once, if proposed at once as a whole, might have been rejected. For supposing it to consist of four clauses, A, B, C, and D; if out of an assembly of one hundred persons, twenty are opposed to clause A, and eighty in favour of it, and the like with B, and with C, and D, then, if the whole were put to the vote at once, there would be a majority of eighty to twenty against it: whereas, if divided, there would be that majority in favour of it. </p><p>"It is fairly to be required, however, that a man should really have—though he may not think it wise to produce it in the first instance—some definite plan for carrying into effect whatever he proposes. Else, he may be one of another class of persons as difficult to negotiate with, and as likely to baffle any measure, as the preceding. There are some, and not a few, who cast scorn on any sober practical scheme by drawing bright pictures of a Utopia which can never be realized, either from their having more of imagination than judgment, or from a deliberate design to put one out of conceit with everything that is practicable, in order that nothing may be done. </p><p>"E.g. 'What is wanted, is, not this and that imrpovement in the mode of electing Members of Parliament,—but a Parliament consisting of truly honest, enlightened, and patriotic men. It is vain to talk of any system of Church­government, or of improved Church-discipline, or any alterations in our Services, or revision of the Bible—translation; what we want is a zealous and truly evangelical ministry, who shall assiduously inculcate on all the people pure Gospel doctrine. It is vain to cast cannon and to raise troops; what is wanted for the successful conduct of the war, is an army of well-equipped and well-disciplined men, under the command of generals who are thoroughly masters of the art of war,' &amp;c. And thus one may, in every department of life, go on indefinitely making fine speeches that can lead to no practical result, except to create a disgust for everything that is practical. </p><p>"When (in 1832) public attention was called to the enormous misehiefs arising from the system of Transportation, we were told in reply, in a style of florid and indignant declamation, that the real cause of all the enormities complained of, was, a 'want of sufficient fear of God;(!) and that the only remedy wanted was, an increased fear of God! As if, when the unhealthiness of some locality had been pointed out, and a suggestion had been thrown out for providing sewers, and draining marshes, it had been replied that the root of the evil was, a prevailing want of health;—that it was strange, this—the true cause—should lave been overlooked;—and that the remedy of all would be to provide restored health! </p><p>"As for the penal colonies, all that is required to make them efficient, is, we must suppose, to bring in a Bill enacting that 'Whereas, &amp;c., be it therefore enacted, that from and after the first of January next ensuing, all persons shall fear God!"</p><p>But when Archbishop Whately attempts to transfer his causticity from the region of practice to that of speculation, he is often singularly infelicitous. In his Preface to this volume, he is severe on the English and American writers, whom he calls "children of the mist," and "who bring forward their speculations—often very silly, and not seldom very mischievous—under cover of the twilight;" and you naturally imagine that he is going to adduce some very vague and flighty passages of the "Pogram" school; but instead of this he quotes a passage, metaphysical indeed, but not more "misty" than the definitions of mathematics, since it is simply a varied statement and illustration of the position, that every idea involves a positive and negative, and the middle term constituted by their relation. The meaning of the writer may be futile, but at any rate his meaning is clearly stated; and it seems to us singular that a theologian who believes in the Trinity, should venture on satirizing the position that "Three in one is the deepest-lying cipher of the universe," by the quotation,— </p><p>"Lo, down thy hill, romantic Ashbourne, glides </p><p>The Derby Dilly carrying three insides." </p><p>A very different volume of miscellaneous contents is that of Professor Wilson's "Essays, Critical and: Imaginative."¹3 We found this volume delightful reading when we were in need of that best of all relaxations, an intellectual laugh; and to any one who is the least peevish or dull, we recommend a dose of VVilson's hearty, rollicking humour in the articles on "Meg Dods's Cookery," "Gymnastics," " Health and Longevity," and " Death in the Pot." His fun is hardly ever subtle or sly, twinkling in the eyes while the mouth is grave; yet </p><p>¹3 "Essays, Critical and Imaginative." By Professor Wilson. Vol. I. Edinburgh: Blackwood and Sous. </p><p>now and then we get a more subdued and indirect touch of humour, that reminds us of Charles Lamb. Thus, à propos of the maxim, "Up with the sun and down with the sun," he says, "Let the solar system, say we, mind its own business, and let us mind ours. There is room enough in the universe for us all. Because an immense globe of fire, or luminous matter, of one kind or another, ever so many millions of miles of, chances to set at a given hour, is that any reason why you must set too, who are close at hand, and not of luminous matter? We hold that it is as reasonable to sit up with the stars as to lie down with the sun. . . . But nothing like a general system of rules for the guidance of human life can be deduced from the motions of the heavenly bodies." Among the more serious contents of this volume, is they excellent appreciation of Wordsworth, especially interesting because it was given in advance of the general voice. </p><p>Mr. Bohn contributes, as usual, to the stock of cheap and solid literature. Besides a volume of the "Orations of Demosthenes,"¹4 and the concluding half of "Quintilian's Institutes,"¹5 he gives us a charming edition of "Walton and Cotton's Complete Angler,"¹6 edited by Mr. Jesse, with numerous and very often excellent illustrations. Quaintly delightful pages! which one may enjoy without having any piscatorial enthusiasm—without having angled for anything more solid than a compliment. But the majority of readers, probably, care for the sport, and to such readers Mr. Bohn's "Notes on Fishing Waters" will be a welcome appendix. </p><p>To students of German we can recommend Dr. Ernst Meier's " His­tory of the Poetical Literature of the Hebrews,"¹7 which is popular and compact, without being slight and superficial. Certain theoretic dif­ferences which the reader may have with Dr. Meier as to the primitive character of the Hebrew monotheism, will not prevent him from finding this volume avery serviceable companion in the study of the Old Testament. It is pleasant to get a serious German work of which we can see the end; for German writers too often oblige us to pay a heavy premium for the thoroughness with which they do their work, by making us wait an indefinite space of time between a first and second volume; and sometimes, indeed, the erster theil remains to the end in a state of melancholy bachelorhood.</p><p>¹4 "The Orations of Demosthenes against the Law of Leptines, Midias, Androtion, and Aristocrates."

But it is a mixture of all these—a composite order of feminine fatuity—that produces the largest class of such novels, which we shall distinguish as the mind-and-millinery species. The heroine is usually an heiress, probably a peeress in her own right, with perhaps a vicious baronet, an amiable duke, and an irresistible younger son of a marquis as lovers in the foreground, a clergyman and a poet sighing for her in the middle distance, and a crowd of undefined adorers dimly indicated beyond. Her eyes and her wit are both dazzling; her nose and her morals are alike free from any tendency to irregularity; she has a superb contralto and a superb intellect; she is perfectly well dressed and perfectly religious; she dances like a sylph, and reads the Bible in the original tongues. Or it may be that the heroine is not an heiress—that rank and wealth are the only things in which she is deficient; but she infallibly gets into high society, she has the triumph of refusing many matches and securing the best, and she wears some family jewels or other as a sort of crown of righteousness at the end. Rakish men either bite their lips in impotent confusion at her repartees, or are touched to penitence by her reproofs, which, on appropriate occasions, rise to a lofty strain of rhetoric; indeed, there is a general propensity in her to make speeches, and to rhapsodize at some length when she retires to her bedroom. In her recorded conversations she is amazingly ​eloquent, and in her unrecorded conversations amazingly witty. She is understood to have a depth of insight that looks through and through the shallow theories of philosophers, and her superior instincts are a sort of dial by which men have only to set their clocks and watches, and all will go well. The men play a very subordinate part by her side. You are consoled now and then by a hint that they have affairs, which keeps you in mind that the working-day business of the world is somehow being carried on, but ostensibly the final cause of their existence is that they may accompany the heroine on her "starring" expedition through life. They see her at a ball, and they are dazzled; at a flower-show, and they are fascinated; on a riding excursion, and they are witched by her noble horsemanship; at church, and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her demeanor. She is the ideal woman in feelings, faculties, and flounces. For all this she as often as not marries the wrong person to begin with, and she suffers terribly from the plots and intrigues of the vicious baronet; but even death has a soft place in his heart for such a paragon, and remedies all mistakes for her just at the right moment. The vicious baronet is sure to be killed in a duel, and the tedious husband dies in his bed requesting his wife, as a particular favor to him, to marry the man she loves best, and having already dispatched a note to the lover informing him of the comfortable arrangement. Before matters arrive at this desirable issue our feelings are tried by seeing the noble, lovely, and gifted heroine pass through many mauvais moments, but we have the satisfaction of knowing that her sorrows are wept into embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, that her fainting form reclines on the very best upholstery, and that whatever vicissitudes she may undergo, from being dashed out of her carriage to having her head shaved in a fever, she comes out of them all with a complexion more blooming and locks more redundant than ever.</p><p>We may remark, by the way, that we have been relieved from a serious scruple by discovering that silly novels by lady ​novelists rarely introduce us into any other than very lofty and fashionable society. We had imagined that destitute women turned novelists, as they turned governesses, because they had no other "ladylike" means of getting their bread. On this supposition, vacillating syntax, and improbable incident had a certain pathos for us, like the extremely supererogatory pin-cushions and ill-devised nightcaps that are offered for sale by a blind man. We felt the commodity to be a nuisance, but we were glad to think that the money went to relieve the necessitous, and we pictured to ourselves lonely women struggling for a maintenance, or wives and daughters devoting themselves to the production of "copy" out of pure heroism—perhaps to pay their husband's debts or to purchase luxuries for a sick father. Under these impressions we shrank from criticising a lady's novel: her English might be faulty, but we said to ourselves her motives are irreproachable; her imagination may be uninventive, but her patience is untiring. Empty writing was excused by an empty stomach, and twaddle was consecrated by tears. But no! This theory of ours, like many other pretty theories, has had to give way before observation. Women's silly novels, we are now convinced, are written under totally different circumstances. The fair writers have evidently never talked to a tradesman except from a carriage window; they have no notion of the working-classes except as "dependents;" they think five hundred a year a miserable pittance; Belgravia and "baronial halls" are their primary truths; and they have no idea of feeling interest in any man who is not at least a great landed proprietor, if not a prime minister. It is clear that they write in elegant boudoirs, with violet-colored ink and a ruby pen; that they must be entirely indifferent to publishers' accounts, and inexperienced in every form of poverty except poverty of brains. It is true that we are constantly struck with the want of verisimilitude in their representations of the high society in which they seem to live; but then they betray no closer acquaintance with any other form of life. If their peers and peeresses are improbable, their ​literary men, tradespeople, and cottagers are impossible; and their intellect seems to have the peculiar impartiality of reproducing both what they have seen and heard, and what they have not seen and heard, with equal unfaithfulness. </p><p>There are few women, we suppose, who have not seen something of children under five years of age, yet in "Compensation," a recent novel of the mind-and-millinery species, which calls itself a "story of real life," we have a child of four and a half years old talking in this Ossianic fashion: </p><p>"Oh, I am so happy, dear gran' mamma;— I have seen—I have seen such a delightful person; he is like everything beautiful—like the smell of sweet flowers, and the view from Ben Lemond;—or no, better than that—he is like what I think of and see when I am very, very happy; and he is really like mamma, too, when she sings; and his forehead is like that distant sea,' she continued, pointing to the blue Mediterranean; 'there seems no end—no end; or like the clusters of stars I like best to look at on a warm fine night. … Don't look so … your forehead is like Loch Lomond, when the wind is blowing and the sun is gone in; I like the sunshine best when the lake is smooth. … So now— I like it better than ever … It is more beautiful still from the dark cloud that has gone over it, when the sun suddenly lights up all the colors of the forests and shining purple rocks, and it is all reflected in the waters below.'"</p><p>We are not surprised to learn that the mother of this infant phenomenon, who exhibits symptoms so alarmingly like those of adolescence repressed by gin, is herself a phœnix. We are assured, again and again, that she had a remarkably original in mind, that she was a genius, and "conscious of her originality," and she was fortunate enough to have a lover who was also a genius and a man of "most original mind." </p><p>This lover, we read, though "wonderfully similar" to her "in powers and capacity," was "infinitely superior to her in faith and development," and she saw in him "'Agape'—so rare to find—of which she had read and admired the meaning in her Greek Testament; having, from her great facility in learning languages, read the Scriptures in their original tongues." Of course! Greek and Hebrew are mere play to ​a heroine; Sanscrit is no more than a b c to her; and she can talk with perfect correctness in any language, except English. She is a polking polyglot, a Creuzer in crinoline. Poor men! There are so few of you who know even Hebrew; you think it something to boast of if, like Bolingbroke, you only "understand that sort of learning and what is writ about it;" and you are perhaps adoring women who can think slightingly of you in all the Semitic languages successively. But, then, as we are almost invariably told that a heroine has a "beautifully small head," and as her intellect has probably been early invigorated by an attention to costume and deportment, we may conclude that she can pick up the Oriental tongues, to say nothing of their dialects, with the same aërial facility that the butterfly sips nectar. Besides, there can be no difficulty in conceiving the depth of the heroine's erudition when that of the authoress is so evident. </p><p>In "Laura Gay," another novel of the same school, the heroine seems less at home in Greek and Hebrew but she makes up for the deficiency by a quite playful familiarity with the Latin classics—with the "dear old Virgil," "the graceful Horace, the humane Cicero, and the pleasant Livy;" indeed, it is such a matter of course with her to quote Latin that she does it at a picnic in a very mixed company of ladies and gentlemen, having, we are told, "no conception that the nobler sex were capable of jealousy on this subject. And if, indeed," continues the biographer of Laura Gay, "the wisest and noblest portion of that sex were in the majority, no such sentiment would exist; but while Miss Wyndhams and Mr. Redfords abound, great sacrifices must be made to their existence." Such sacrifices, we presume, as abstaining from Latin quotations, of extremely moderate interest and applicability, which the wise and noble minority of the other sex would be quite as willing to dispense with as the foolish and ignoble majority. It is as little the custom of well-bred men as of well-bred women to quote Latin in mixed parties; they can contain their familiarity with "the humane Cicero" without allowing it ​to boil over in ordinary conversation, and even references to "the pleasant Livy" are not absolutely irrepressible. But Ciceronian Latin is the mildest form of Miss Gay's conversational power. Being on the Palatine with a party of sightseers, she falls into the following vein of well-rounded remark: "Truth can only be pure objectively, for even in the creeds where it predominates, being subjective, and parcelled out into portions, each of these necessarily receives a hue of idiosyncrasy, that is, a taint of superstition more or less strong; while in such creeds as the Roman Catholic, ignorance, interest, the basis of ancient idolatries, and the force of authority, have gradually accumulated on the pure truth, and transformed it, at last, into a mass of superstition for the majority of its votaries; and how few are there, alas! whose zeal, courage, and intellectual energy are equal to the analysis of this accumulation, and to the discovery of the pearl of great price which lies hidden beneath this heap of rubbish." We have often met with women much more novel and profound in their observations than Laura Gay, but rarely with any so inopportunely long-winded. A clerical lord, who is half in love with her, is alarmed by the daring remarks just quoted, and begins to suspect that she is inclined to free-thinking. But he is mistaken; when in a moment of sorrow he delicately begs leave to "recall to her memory, a depôt of strength and consolation under affliction, which, until we are hard pressed by the trials of life, we are too apt to forget," we learn that she really has "recurrence to that sacred depôt," together with the tea-pot. There is a certain flavor of orthodoxy mixed with the parade of fortunes and line carriages in "Laura Gay," but it is an orthodoxy mitigated by study of "the humane Cicero," and by an "intellectual disposition to analyze."</p><p>"Compensation" is much more heavily dosed with doctrine, but then it has a treble amount of snobbish worldliness and absurd incident to tickle the palate of pious frivolity. Linda, the heroine, is still more speculative and spiritual than Laura Gay, but she has been "presented," and has more and far ​grander lovers; very wicked and fascinating women are introduced—even a French honne; and no expense is spared to get up as exciting a story as you will find in the most immoral novels. In fact, it is a wonderful pot pourri of Almack's, Scotch second-sight, Mr. Rogers's breakfasts, Italian brigands, death-bed conversions, superior authoresses, Italian mistresses, and attempts at poisoning old ladies, the whole served up with a garnish of talk about "faith and development" and "most original minds." Even Miss Susan Barton, the superior authoress, whose pen moves in a "quick, decided manner when she is composing," declines the finest opportunities of marriage; and though old enough to be Linda's mother (since we are told that she refused Linda's father), has her hand sought by a young earl, the heroine's rejected lover. Of course, genius and morality must be backed by eligible offers, or they would seem rather a dull affair; and piety, like other things, in order to be comme il faut, must be in "society," and have admittance to the best circles. </p><p>"Rank and Beauty" is a more frothy and less religious variety of the mind-and-millinery species. The heroine, we are told, "if she inherited her father's pride of birth and her mother's beauty of person, had in herself a tone of enthusiastic feeling that, perhaps, belongs to her age even in the lowly born, but which is refined into the high spirit of wild romance only in the far descended, who feel that it is their best inheritance." This enthusiastic young lady, by dint of reading the newspaper to her father, falls in love with the prime minister, who, through the medium of leading articles and "the resumé of the debates," shines upon her imagination as a bright particular star, which has no parallax for her living in the country as simple Miss Wyndham. But she forthwith becomes Baroness Umfraville in her own right, astonishes the world with her beauty and accomplishments when she bursts upon it from her mansion in Spring Gardens, and, as you foresee, will presently come into contact with the unseen objet aimé. Perhaps the words "prime minister" suggest to you a wrinkled or ​obese sexagenarian; but pray dismiss the image. Lord Rupert Conway has been "called while still almost a youth to the first situation which a subject can hold in the universe," and even leading articles and a resumé of the debates have not conjured up a dream that surpasses the fact. </p><p>"The door opened again, and Lord Rupert Conway entered. Evelyn gave one glance. It was enough; she was not disappointed. It seemed as if a picture on which she had long gazed was suddenly instinct with life, and had stepped from its frame before her. His tall figure, the distinguished simplicity of his air— it was a living Vandyke, a cavalier, one of his noble cavalier ancestors, or one to whom her fancy had always likened him, who long of yore had with an Umfraville fought the Paynim far beyond the sea. Was this reality?" </p><p>Very little like it, certainly, </p><p>By and by it becomes evident that the ministerial heart is touched. Lady Umfraville is on a visit to the Queen at Windsor, and — </p><p>"The last evening of her stay, when they returned from riding, Mr. Wyndham took her and a large party to the top of the Keep, to see the view. She was leaning on the battlements, gazing from that 'stately height' at the prospect beneath her, when Lord Rupert was by her side. 'What an unrivalled view!' exclaimed she. </p><p>"'Yes, it would have been wrong to go without having been up here. You are pleased with your visit?' </p><p>"'Enchanted! A Queen to live and die under, to live and die for!' </p><p>"'Ha!' cried he, with sudden emotion, and with a eureka expression of countenance, as if he had indeed found a heart in unison with his own.'" </p><p>The "eureka expression of countenance" you see at once to be prophetic of marriage at the end of the third volume; but before that desirable consummation there are very complicated misunderstandings, arising chiefly from the vindictive plotting of Sir Luttrel Wycherley, who is a genius, a poet, and in every way a most remarkable character indeed. He is not only a romantic poet, but a hardened rake and a cynical wit; yet ​his deep passion for Lady Umfraville has so impoverished his epigrammatic talent that he cuts an extremely poor figure in conversation. When she rejects him, he rushes into the shrubbery and rolls himself in the dirt; and on recovering, devotes himself to the most diabolical and laborious schemes of vengeance, in the course of which he disguises himself as a quack physician and enters into general practice, foreseeing that Evelyn will fall ill, and that he shall be called in to attend her. At last, when all his schemes are frustrated, he takes leave of her in a long letter, written, as you will perceive from the following passage, entirely in the style of an eminent literary man: </p><p>"Oh, lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure, will you ever cast one thought upon the miserable being who addresses you? Will you ever, as your gilded galley is floating down the unruffled stream of prosperity, will you ever, while lulled by the sweetest music—thine own praises—hear the far-off sigh from that world to which I am going?" </p><p>On the whole, however, frothy as it is, we rather prefer "Rank and Beauty" to the two other novels we have mentioned. The dialogue is more natural and spirited; there is some frank ignorance and no pedantry; and you are allowed to take the heroine's astounding intellect upon trust, without being called on to read her conversational refutations of sceptics and philosophers, or her rhetorical solutions of the mysteries of the universe. </p><p>Writers of the mind-and-millinery school are remarkably unanimous in their choice of diction. In their novels there is usually a lady or gentleman who is more or less of a upas tree; the lover has a manly breast; minds are redolent of various things; hearts are hollow; events are utilized; friends are consigned to the tomb; infancy is an engaging period; the sun is a luminary that goes to his western couch, or gathers the rain-drops into his refulgent bosom; life is a melancholy boon; Albion and Scotia are conversational epithets. There is a striking resemblance, too, in the character of their moral comments, such, for instance, as that "It is a fact, no less true ​than melancholy, that all people, more or less, richer or poorer, are swayed by bad example;" that "Books, however trivial, contain some subjects from which useful information may be drawn;" that "Vice can too often borrow the language of virtue;" that Merit and nobility of nature must exist, to be accepted, for clamor and pretension cannot impose upon those too well read in human nature to be easily deceived;" and that "In order to forgive, we must have been injured." There is doubtless a class of readers to whom these remarks appear peculiarly pointed and pungent; for we often find them doubly and trebly scored with the pencil, and delicate hands giving in their determined adhesion to these hardy novelties by a distinct très vrai, emphasized by many notes of exclamation. The colloquial style of these novels is often marked by much ingenious inversion, and a careful avoidance of such cheap phraseology as can be heard every day. Angry young gentlemen exclaim, "'Tis ever thus, methinks;" and in the half hour before dinner a young lady informs her next neighbor that the first day she read Shakespeare she "stole away into the park, and beneath the shadow of the greenwood tree, devoured with rapture the inspired page of the great magician." But the most remarkable efforts of the mind-and-millinery writers lie in their philosophic reflections. The authoress of "Laura Gay," for example, having married her hero and heroine, improves the event by observing that "if those sceptics, whose eyes have so long gazed on matter that they can no longer see aught else in man, could once enter with heart and soul, into such bliss as this, they would come to say that the soul of man and the polypus are not of common origin, or of the same texture." Lady novelists, it appears, can see something else besides matter; they are not limited to phenomena, but can relieve their eyesight by occasional glimpses of the noumenon, and are, therefore, naturally better able than any one else to confound sceptics, even of that remarkable but to us unknown school which maintains that the soul of man is of the same texture as the polypus.</p><p>​The most pitiable of all silly novels by lady novelists are what we may call the oracular species—novels intended to expound the writer's religious, philosophical, or moral theories. There seems to be a notion abroad among women, rather akin to the superstition that the speech and actions of idiots are inspired, and that the human being most entirely exhausted of common-sense is the fittest vehicle of revelation. To judge from their writings, there are certain ladies who think that an amazing ignorance, both of science and of life, is the best possible qualification for forming an opinion on the knottiest moral and speculative questions. Apparently, their recipe for solving all such difficulties is something like this: Take a woman's head, stuff it with a smattering of philosophy and literature chopped small, and with false notions of society baked hard, let it hang over a desk a few hours every day, and serve up hot in feeble English when not required. You will rarely meet with a lady novelist of the oracular class who is diffident of her ability to decide on theological questions—who has any suspicion that she is not capable of discriminating with the nicest accuracy between the good and evil in all church parties—who does not see precisely how it is that men have gone wrong hitherto—and pity philosophers in general that they have not had the opportunity of consulting her. Great writers, who have modestly contented themselves with putting their experience into fiction, and have thought it quite a sufficient task to exhibit men and things as they are, she sighs over as deplorably deficient in the application of their powers. "They have solved no great questions"—and she is ready to remedy their omission by setting before you a complete theory of life and manual of divinity in a love story, where ladies and gentlemen of good family go through genteel vicissitudes, to the utter confusion of Deists, Puseyites, and ultra-Protestants, and to the perfect establishment of that peculiar view of Christianity which either condenses itself into a sentence of small caps, or explodes into a cluster of stars on the three hundred and thirtieth page. It is true, the ladies and ​gentlemen will probably seem to you remarkably little like any you have had the fortune or misfortune to meet with, for, as a general rule, the ability of a lady novelist to describe actual life and her fellow-men is in inverse proportion to her confident eloquence about God and the other world, and the means by which she usually chooses to conduct you to true ideas of the invisible is a totally false picture of the visible.</p><p>As typical a novel of the oracular kind as we can hope to meet with, is "The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the Wolchorley House." The "enigma" which this novel is to solve is certainly one that demands powers no less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more nor less than the existence of evil. The problem is stated and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page. The spirited young lady, with raven hair, says, "All life is an inextricable confusion;" and the meek young lady, with auburn hair, looks at the picture of the Madonna which she is copying, and—"There seemed the solution of that mighty enigma." The style of this novel is quite as lofty as its purpose; indeed, some passages on which we have spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach, in spite of the illustrative aid of italics and small caps; and we must await further "development" in order to understand them. Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every one right on all occasions, we read that " he held not of marriage in the marketable kind, after a social desecration;" that, on one eventful night, "sleep had not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in varied type and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;" and that, "for the marketable human article he had no toleration, be it of what sort, or set for what value it might, whether for worship or class, his upright soul abhorred it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver, was to him the great spiritual lie, 'living in a vain show, deceiving and being deceived;' since he did not suppose the phylactery and enlarged border on the garment to be merely a social trick." (The italics and small caps are the author's, and we hope they assist the reader's ​comprehension.) Of Sir Lionel, the model old gentleman, we are told that "the simple ideal of the middle age, apart from its anarchy and decadence, in him most truly seemed to live again, when the ties which knit men together were of heroic cast. The first-born colors of pristine faith and truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the wide arch of brotherhood, where the primæval law of order grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually interdependent." You see clearly, of course, how colors are first engraven on the soul, and then blent into a wide arch, on which arch of colors—apparently a rainbow—the law of order grew and multiplied, each—apparently the arch and the law—perfect after his kind? If, after this, you can possibly want any further aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, we can tell you that in his soul "the scientific combinations of thought could educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in the primæval pulses which floated as an atmosphere around it!" and that, when he was sealing a letter, "Lo! the responsive throb in that good man's bosom echoed back in simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him not, as his eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something of ancestral pride, on the undimmed motto of the family—"Loiaute.'" </p><p>The slightest matters have their vulgarity fumigated out of them by the same elevated style. Commonplace people would say that a copy of Shakespeare lay on a drawing-room table; but the authoress of "The Enigma," bent on edifying periphrasis, tells you that there lay on the table, "that fund of human thought and feeling, which teaches the heart through the little name, 'Shakespeare.'" A watchman sees a light burning in an upper window rather longer than usual, and thinks that people are foolish to sit up late when they have an opportunity of going to bed; but, lest this fact should seem too low and common, it is presented to us in the following striking and metaphysical manner: "He marvelled—as a man will think for others in a necessarily separate personality, ​consequently (though disallowing it) in false mental premise — how differently he should act, how gladly he should prize the rest so lightly held of within." A footman—an ordinary Jeames, with large calves and aspirated vowels—answers the door-bell, and the opportunity is seized to tell you that he was a "type of the large class of pampered menials, who follow the curse of Cain—'vagabonds' on the face of the earth, and whose estimate of the human class varies in the graduated scale of money and expenditure. … These, and such as these, O England, be the false lights of thy morbid civilization!" We have heard of various "false lights," from Dr. Cumming to Robert Owen, from Dr. Pusey to the Spirit-rappers, but we never before heard of the false light that emanates from plush and powder.</p><p>In the same way very ordinary events of civilized life are exalted into the most awful crises, and ladies in full skirts and manches à la Chinoise, conduct themselves not unlike the heroines of sanguinary melodramas. Mrs. Percy, a shallow woman of the world, wishes her son Horace to marry the auburn-haired Grace, she being an heiress; but he, after the manner of sons, falls in love with the raven-haired Kate, the heiress's portionless cousin; and, moreover, Grace herself shows every symptom of perfect indifference to Horace. In such cases sons are often sulky or fiery, mothers are alternately manœuvring and waspish, and the portionless young lady often lies awake at night and cries a good deal. We are getting used to these things now, just as we are used to eclipses of the moon, which no longer set us howling and beating tin kettles. We never heard of a lady in a fashionable "front" behaving like Mrs. Percy under these circumstances. Happening one day to see Horace talking to Grace at a window, without in the least knowing what they are talking about, or having the least reason to believe that Grace, who is mistress of the house and a person of dignity, would accept her son if he were to offer himself, she suddenly rushes up to them and clasps them both, saying, "with a flushed countenance and in ​an excited manner"—"This is indeed happiness; for, may I not call you so, Grace?—my Grace—my Horace's Grace!—my dear children!" Her son tells her she is mistaken, and that he is engaged to Kate, whereupon we have the following scene and tableau: </p><p>"Gathering herself up to an unprecedented height (!) her eyes lightening forth the fire of her anger: </p><p>"'Wretched boy!' she said, hoarsely and scornfully, and clenching her hand, 'Take then the doom of your own choice! Bow down your miserable head and let a mother's—' </p><p>"'Curse not!' spake a deep low voice from behind, and Mrs. Percy started, scared, as though she had seen a heavenly visitant appear, to break upon her in the midst of her sin. </p><p>"Meantime Horace had fallen on his knees, at her feet, and hid his face in his hands. </p><p>"Who then, is she—who! Truly his 'guardian spirit' hath stepped between him and the fearful words, which, however unmerited, must have hung as a pall over his future existence;—a spell which could not be unbound—which could not be unsaid. </p><p>"Of an earthly paleness, but calm with the still, iron-bound calmness of death—the only calm one there—Katherine stood; and her words smote on the ear in tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation rung on the heart like a chill, isolated tolling of some fatal knell. </p><p>"'He would have plighted me his faith, but I did not accept it; you cannot, therefore—you dare not curse him. And here,' she continued, raising her hand to heaven, whither her large dark eyes also rose with a chastened glow, which, for the first time, suffering had lighted in those passionate orbs—'here I promise, come weal, come woe, that Horace Wolchorley and I do never interchange vows without his mother's sanction—without his mother's blessing!'" </p><p>Here, and throughout the story, we see that confusion of purpose which is so characteristic of silly novels written by women. It is a story of quite modern drawing-room ​society—a society in which polkas are played and Puseyism discussed; yet we have characters, and incidents, and traits of manner introduced, which are mere shreds from the most heterogeneous romances. We have a blind Irish harper, "relic of the picturesque bards of yore," startling us at a Sunday-school festival of tea and cake in an English village; we have a crazy gypsy, in a scarlet cloak, singing snatches of romantic song, and revealing a secret on her death-bed which, with the testimony of a dwarfish miserly merchant, who salutes strangers with a curse and a devilish laugh, goes to prove that Ernest, the model young clergyman, is Kate's brother; and we have an ultra-virtuous Irish Barney, discovering that a document is forged, by comparing the date of the paper with the date of the alleged signature, although the same document has passed through a court of law and occasioned a fatal decision. The "Hall" in which Sir Lionel lives is the venerable country-seat of an old family, and this, we suppose, sets the imagination of the authoress flying to donjons and battlements, where "lo! the warder blows his horn;" for, as the inhabitants are in their bedrooms on a night certainly within the recollection of Pleaceman X. and a breeze springs up, which we are at first told was faint, and then that it made the old cedars bow their branches to the greensward, she falls into this mediæval vein of description (the italics are ours): "The banner unfurled it at the sound, and shook its guardian wing above, while the startled owl flapped her in the ivy; the firmament looking down through her 'argus eyes' — </p><p>'Ministers of heaven's mute melodies.' </p><p>And lo! two strokes tolled from out the warder tower, and 'Two o'clock' re-echoed its interpreter below." </p><p>Such stories as this of "The Enigma" remind us of the pictures clever children sometimes draw "out of their own head," where you will see a modern villa on the right, two knights in helmets fighting in the foreground, and a tiger grinning in a jungle on the left, the several objects being brought together ​because the artist thinks each pretty, and perhaps still more because he remembers seeing them in other pictures. </p><p>But we like the authoress much better on her mediæval stilts than on her oracular ones—when she talks of the Ich and of "subjective" and "objective," and lays down the exact line of Christian verity, between "right-hand excesses and lefthand declensions." Persons who deviate from this line are introduced with a patronizing air of charity. Of a certain Miss Inshquine she informs us, with all the lucidity of italics and small caps, that "function, not form, as the inevitable outer expression of the spirit in this tabernacle age, weakly engrossed her." And à propos of Miss Mayjar, an evangelical lady who is a little too apt to talk of her visits to sick women and the state of their souls, we are told that the model clergyman is "not one to disallow, through the super crust, the undercurrent toward good in the subject, or the positive benefits, nevertheless, to the object." We imagine the double-refined accent and protrusion of chin which are feebly represented by the italics in this lady's sentences! We abstain from quoting any of her oracular doctrinal passages, because they refer to matters too serious for our pages just now. </p><p>The epithet "silly" may seem impertinent, applied to a novel which indicates so much reading and intellectual activity as "The Enigma," but we use this epithet advisedly. If, as the world has long agreed, a very great amount of instruction will not make a wise man, still less will a very mediocre amount of instruction make a wise woman. And the most mischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary form, because it tends to confirm the popular prejudice against the more solid education of women.</p><p>When men see girls wasting their time in consultations about bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can hardly help saying, "For Heaven's sake, let girls be better educated; let them have some better objects of thought—some ​more solid occupations." But after a few hours' conversation with an oracular literary woman, or a few hours' reading of her books, they are likely enough to say, "After all, when a woman gets some knowledge, see what use she makes of it! Her knowledge remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own 'intellectuality;' she spoils the taste of one's muffin by questions of metaphysics; 'puts down' men at a dinner-table with her superior information; and seizes the opportunity of a soirée to catechise us on the vital question of the relation between mind and matter. And then, look at her writings! She mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for originality; she struts on one page, rolls her eyes on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth. She may have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the difference between his own English and a Londoner's: rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect. No—the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest crops." </p><p>It is true that the men who come to such a decision on such very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the wisest in the world; but we have not now to contest their opinion—we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as representatives of the feminine intellect. We do not believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by associating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it. A really cultured woman, like a really cultured man, is all the simpler and the less obtrusive for her knowledge; it has made her see her​self and her opinions in something like just proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and things, but makes it a point of observation from which to form a right estimate of herself. She neither spouts poetry nor quotes Cicero on slight provocation; not because she thinks that a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men, but because that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity does not present itself to her as edifying or graceful. She does not write books to confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to write books that delight them. In conversation she is the least formidable of women, because she understands you, without wanting to make you aware that you can't understand her. She does not give you information, which is the raw material of culture—she gives you sympathy, which is its subtlest essence. </p><p>A more numerous class of silly novels than the oracular (which are generally inspired by some form of High Church or transcendental Christianity) is what we may call the white neck-cloth species, which represent the tone of thought and feeling in the Evangelical party. This species is a kind of genteel tract on a large scale, intended as a sort of medicinal sweetmeat for Low Church young ladies; an Evangelical substitute for the fashionable novel, as the May Meetings are a substitute for the Opera. Even Quaker children, one would think, can hardly have been denied the indulgence of a doll; but it must be a doll dressed in a drab gown and a coal-scuttle-bonnet—not a worldly doll, in gauze and spangles. And there are no young ladies, we imagine—unless they belong to the Church of the United Brethren, in which people are married without any love-making—who can dispense with love stories. Thus, for Evangelical young ladies there are Evangelical love stories, in which the vicissitudes of the tender passion are sanctified by saving views of Regeneration and the Atonement. These novels differ from the oracular ones, as a Low Churchwoman often differs from a High Churchwoman: they are a little less ​supercilious and a great deal more ignorant, a little less correct in their syntax and a great deal more vulgar.</p><p>The Orlando of Evangelical literature is the young curate, looked at from the point of view of the middle class, where cambric bands are understood to have as thrilling an effect on the hearts of young ladies as epaulettes have in the classes above and below it. In the ordinary type of these novels the hero is almost sure to be a young curate, frowned upon, perhaps by worldly mammas, but carrying captive the hearts of their daughters, who can "never forget that sermon;" tender glances are seized from the pulpit stairs instead of the opera-box; tête-à-têtes are seasoned with quotations from Scripture instead of quotations from the poets; and questions as to the state of the heroine's affections are mingled with anxieties as to the state of her soul. The young curate always has a background of well-dressed and wealthy if not fashionable society—for Evangelical silliness is as snobbish as any other kind of silliness—and the Evangelical lady novelist, while she explains to you the type of the scapegoat on one page, is ambitious on another to represent the manners and conversations of aristocratic people. Her pictures of fashionable society are often curious studies, considered as efforts of the Evangelical imagination; but in one particular the novels of the White Neck-cloth School are meritoriously realistic—their favorite hero, the Evangelical young curate, is always rather an insipid personage. </p><p>The most recent novel of this species that we happen to have before us is "The Old Grey Church." It is utterly tame and feeble; there is no one set of objects on which the writer seems to have a stronger grasp than on any other; and we should be entirely at a loss to conjecture among what phases of life her experience has been gained, but for certain vulgarisms of style which sufficiently indicate that she has had the advantage, though she has been unable to use it, of mingling chiefly with men and women whose manners and characters have not had all their bosses and angles rubbed down by refined conventionalism. It is less excusable in an Evangelical novelist than ​in any other, gratuitously to seek her subjects among titles and carriages. The real drama of Evangelicalism—and it has abundance of fine drama for any one who has genius enough to discern and reproduce it—lies among the middle and lower classes; and are not Evangelical opinions understood to give an especial interest in the weak things of the earth, rather than in the mighty? Why, then, cannot our Evangelical lady novelists show us the operation of their religious views among people (there really are many such in the world) who keep no carriage, "not so much as a brass-bound gig," who even manage to eat their dinner without a silver fork, and in whose mouths the authoress's questionable English would be strictly consistent? Why can we not have pictures of religious life among the industrial classes in England, as interesting as Mrs. Stowe's pictures of religious life among the negroes? Instead of this pious ladies nauseate us with novels which remind us of what we sometimes see in a worldly woman recently "converted;"—she is as fond of a fine dinner-table as before, but she invites clergymen instead of beaux; she thinks as much of her dress as before, but she adopts a more sober choice of colors and patterns; her conversation is as trivial as before, but the triviality is flavored with gospel instead of gossip. In "The Old Grey Church" we have the same sort of Evangelical travesty of the fashionable novel, and of course the vicious, intriguing baronet is not wanting. It is worth while to give a sample of the style of conversation attributed to this high-born rake—a style that, in its profuse italics and palpable innuendoes, is worthy of Miss Squeers. In an evening visit to the ruins of the Colosseum, Eustace, the young clergyman, has been withdrawing the heroine, Miss Lushington, from the rest of the party, for the sake of a tête-à-tête. The baronet is jealous, and vents his pique in this way:</p><p>"There they are, and Miss Lushington, no doubt, quite safe; for she is under the holy guidance of Pope Eustace the First, who has, of course, been delivering to her an edifying homily on the wickedness of the heathens of yore, who, as tradition tells us, in this very ​place let loose the wild beastises on poor St. Paul!—Oh, no! by the bye, I believe I am wrong, and betraying my want of clergy, and that it was not at all St. Paul, nor was it here. But no matter, it would equally serve as a text to preach from, and from which to diverge to the degenerate heathen Christians of the present day, and all their naughty practices, and so end with an exhortation to 'come out from among them, and be separate;'—and I am sure, Miss Lushington, you have most scrupulously conformed to that injunction this evening, for we have seen nothing of you since our arrival. But every one seems agreed it has been a charming party of pleasure, and I am sure we all feel much indebted to Mr. Gray for having suggested it; and as he seems so capital a cicerone, I hope he will think of something else equally agreeable to all." </p><p>This drivelling kind of dialogue, and equally drivelling narrative, which, like a bad drawing, represents nothing, and barely indicates what is meant to be represented, runs through the book; and we have no doubt is considered by the amiable authoress to constitute an improving novel, which Christian mothers will do well to put into the hands of their daughters. But everything is relative; we have met with American vegetarians whose normal diet was dry meal, and who, when their appetite wanted stimulating, tickled it with wet meal; and so, we can imagine that there are Evangelical circles in which "The Old Grey Church" is devoured as a powerful and interesting fiction. </p><p>But perhaps the least readable of silly women's novels are the modern-antique species, which unfold to us the domestic life of Jannes and Jambres, the private love affairs of Sennacherib, or the mental struggles and ultimate conversion of Demetrius the silversmith. From most silly novels we can at least extract a laugh; but those of the modern-antique school have a ponderous, a leaden kind of fatuity, under which we groan. What can be more demonstrative of the inability of literary women to measure their own powers than their frequent assumption of a task which can only be justified by the rarest concurrence of acquirement with genius? The finest effort to reanimate the past is of course only approximative—is ​always more or less an infusion of the modern spirit into the ancient form — </p><p>Was ihr den Geist der Zeiten heisst, </p><p>Das ist im Grand der Herren eigner Geist, </p><p>In dem die Zeiten sich bespiegeln. </p><p>Admitting that genius which has familiarized itself with all the relics of an ancient period can sometimes, by the force of its sympathetic divination, restore the missing notes in the "music of humanity," and reconstruct the fragments into a whole which will really bring the remote past nearer to us, and interpret it to our duller apprehension—this form of imaginative power must always be among the very rarest, because it demands as much accurate and minute knowledge as creative vigor. Yet we find ladies constantly choosing to make their mental mediocrity more conspicuous by clothing it in a masquerade of ancient names; by putting their feeble sentimentality into the mouths of Roman vestals or Egyptian princesses, and attributing their rhetorical arguments to Jewish high-priests and Greek philosophers. A recent example of this heavy imbecility is "Adonijah, a Tale of the Jewish Dispersion," which forms part of a series, "uniting," we are told, "taste, humor, and sound principles." "Adonijah," we presume, exemplifies the tale of "sound principles;" the taste and humor are to be found in other members of the series. We are told on the cover that the incidents of this tale are "fraught with unusual interest," and the preface winds up thus: "To those who feel interested in the dispersed of Israel and Judea, these pages may afford, perhaps, information on an important subject, as well as amusement." Since the "important subject" on which this book is to afford information is not specified, it may possibly lie in some esoteric meaning to which we have no key; but if it has relation to the dispersed of Israel and Judea at any period of their history, we believe a tolerably well-informed school-girl already knows much more of it than she will find in this "Tale of the Jewish Dispersion." "Adonijah" is simply the feeblest kind of love story, sup​posed to be instructive, we presume, because the hero is a Jewish captive and the heroine a Roman vestal; because they and their friends are converted to Christianity after the shortest and easiest method approved by the "Society for Promoting the Conversion of the Jews;" and because, instead of being written in plain language, it is adorned with that peculiar style of grandiloquence which is held by some lady novelists to give an antique coloring, and which we recognize at once in such phrases as these:—"the splendid regnal talent, undoubtedly, possessed by the Emperor Nero"—"the expiring scion of a lofty stem"—"the virtuous partner of his couch"—"ah, by Vesta!"—and "I tell thee, Roman." Among the quotations which serve at once for instruction and ornament on the cover of this volume, there is one from Miss Sinclair, which informs us that "Works of imagination are avowedly read by men of science, wisdom, and piety;" from which we suppose the reader is to gather the cheering inference that Dr. Daubeny, Mr. Mill, or Mr. Maurice may openly indulge himself with the perusal of "Adonijah," without being obliged to secrete it among the sofa cushions, or read it by snatches under the dinner-table.</p><p>"Be not a baker if your head be made of butter," says a homely proverb, which, being interpreted, may mean, let no woman rush into print who is not prepared for the consequences. We are aware that our remarks are in a very different tone from that of the reviewers who, with perennial recurrence of precisely similar emotions, only paralleled, we imagine, in the experience of monthly nurses, tell one lady novelist after another that they "hail" her productions "with delight." We are aware that the ladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be told, in the choicest phraseology of puffery, that their pictures of life are brilliant, their characters well drawn, their style fascinating, and their sentiments lofty. But if they are inclined to resent our plainness of speech, we ask them to reflect for a moment on the chary ​praise, and often captious blame, which their panegyrists give to writers whose works are on the way to become classics. No sooner does a woman show that she has genius or effective talent, than she receives the tribute of being moderately praised and severely criticised. By a peculiar thermometric adjustment, when a woman's talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch; when she attains mediocrity, it is already at no more than summer heat; and if ever she reaches excellence, critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point. Harriet Martineau, Currer Bell, and Mrs. Gaskell have been treated as cavalierly as if they had been men. And every critic who forms a high estimate of the share women may ultimately take in literature, will on principle abstain from any exceptional indulgence toward the productions of literary women. For it must be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively into feminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due hardly more to the want of intellectual power than to the want of those moral qualities that contribute to literary excellence—patient diligence, a sense of the responsibility involved in publication, and an appreciation of the sacredness of the writer's art. In the majority of women's books you see that kind of facility which springs from the absence of any high standard; that fertility in imbecile combination or feeble imitation which a little self-criticism would check and reduce to barrenness; just as with a total want of musical ear people will sing out of tune, while a degree more melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent. The foolish vanity of wishing to appear in print, instead of being counterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or moral derogation implied in futile authorship, seems to be encouraged by the extremely false impression that to write at all is a proof of superiority in a woman. On this ground we believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly represented by the mass of feminine literature, and that while the few women who write well are very far above the ordinary intellectual level of their sex, the many women who write ill are very far below it. So ​that, after all, the severer critics are fulfilling a chivalrous duty in depriving the mere fact of feminine authorship of any false prestige which may give it a delusive attraction, and in recommending women of mediocre faculties—as at least a negative service they can render their sex—to abstain from writing.</p><p>The standing apology for women who become writers without any special qualification is that society shuts them out from other spheres of occupation. Society is a very culpable entity, and has to answer for the manufacture of many unwholesome commodities, from bad pickles to bad poetry. But society, like "matter," and Her Majesty's Government, and other lofty abstractions, has its share of excessive blame as well as excessive praise. Where there is one woman who writes from necessity, we believe there are three women who write from vanity; and besides, there is something so antispetic in the mere healthy fact of working for one's bread, that the most trashy and rotten kind of feminine literature is not likely to have been produced under such circumstances. "In all labor there is profit;" but ladies' silly novels, we imagine, are less the result of labor than of busy idleness. </p><p>Happily, we are not dependent on argument to prove that Fiction is a department of literature in which women can, after their kind, fully equal men. A cluster of great names, both living and dead, rush to our memories in evidence that women can produce novels not only fine, but among the very finest—novels, too, that have a precious speciality, lying quite apart from masculine aptitudes and experience. No educational restrictions can shut women out from the materials of fiction, and there is no species of art which is so free from rigid requirements. Like crystalline masses, it may take any form, and yet be beautiful; we have only to pour in the right elements—genuine observation, humor, and passion. But it is precisely this absence of rigid requirement which constitutes the fatal seduction of novel-writing to incompetent women. Ladies are not wont to be very grossly deceived as to their power of playing on the piano; here certain positive difficulties ​of execution have to be conquered, and incompetence inevitably breaks down. Every art which has its absolute technique is, to a certain extent, guarded from the intrusions of mere left-handed imbecility. But in novel-writing there are no barriers for incapacity to stumble against, no external criteria to prevent a writer from mistaking foolish facility for mastery. And so we have again and again the old story of La Fontaine's ass, who puts his nose to the flute, and, finding that he elicits some sound, exclaims, "Moi, aussi, je joue de la flute"—a fable which we commend, at parting, to the consideration of any feminine reader who is in danger of adding to the number of "silly novels by lady novelists." </p><p>BELLES LETTRES AND ART (POETRY REVIEW, JANUARY 1857). </p><p>Few poets of this generation can say of themselves that they "woke one morning to find themselves famous." This has been Mr. Alexander Smith's good or evil fortune. Tennyson slowly ascended to his zenith; the two Brownings were long in winning a fair acknowledgment; Matthew Arnold is still all but unknown, notwithstanding his noble poetic faculty: Mr. Alexander Smith shares with the author of "Festus" the application of the Byronic phrase we have quoted. We trust that he is not, in imitation of his rival, going to treat us to a series of disappointments, and make such a production as the "Life Drama" the basis of a fame for which, to those who read it when the promise it contained has been belied, it will scarcely seem the apology. The "Life Drama" was remarkable as the work of a very young man in a season of poetic dearth. It was built on a story of Keats and Tennyson, and affinity with those poets. Its blank-verse, monotonous in the end, was exquisitely sweet, and showed ease and feeling, as well as careful reading of the masters of that metre. The poem abounded in fine isolated lines, in charming conceits, thrown sensibly out as such, and everywhere, in spite of occasional spasmodism, it was evident that the Author's brain was not dazzled by his own exhibition of fireworks, but had at bottom an active common sense that would ultimately hold him from the excesses of the school whose faith he professed, and was even then vigilant to avert obscurity and many of those vain irregularities which characterize "Festus" and "Balder." The sonnets at the close of the volume we remember as a further instance of his possession of the faculty of verse, and of the promise of higher perfection. Having said thus much, the critic, </p><p>"Running a mile that he might leap a yard," </p><p>as Mr. Smith finely writes, must admit that he is disappointed in the "City Poems."  They are not up to the mark. The style of the poems, the very cadences of the verse, recall the "Life Drama." Moreover, Mr. Smith has not got a whit nearer to real life. He is still wandering outside the busy circle, making a poem of it not from it.</p><p>Four years have elapsed since the publication of the "Life Drama." We have a right to expect something different, and much better, after such an interval. Powers so precocious should be neighbouring maturity by this time. Mr. Smith talks and talks: he is more and more Alexander Smith, and proportionately less the </p><p> "City Poems." By Alexander Smith. Cambridge: Macmillan and Co. 1857.</p><p>poet we hoped he wonld be. That he is a true poet many passages in this volume sufficiently prove; hut he is not creative, and we cannot say that he is even original. The spirit and tone of Tennyson are reproduced in the "City Poems;" it is impossible to forget the Laureate while we read them. His characters are the merest abstractions pegs for the hanging of poetic bravery on; and so long-winded are the reflective parts, the digressions so random, that all story is lost in them. Horton is an ill-fated genius, who </p><p>"Plunged from off this crumbling shoal of Time, </p><p>Struck for the coast of Fame with stiffened </p><p>	limbs</p><p>Went down in sight of land." </p><p>He flies before the reader like a gossamer in a mist, and in fact he is just such a filmy substance. A set of young men, discussing his history, strike out here and there some clever images, with a fling at the critics by the way. We are to presume, doubtless, that Charles, James, Max, John, and Harry, are a group of spasmodic poets disguised under Christian-names. At least their hostility to our class, contempt for cotton, and general preference of soliloquy to dialogue, may warrant the supposition. For the rest, they speak more sensibly than the race usually does. Thus picturing Horton's eyes,</p><p>"The thought stood in them ere 'twas spoken; </p><p>	Wit</p><p>Laughed on you from the windows ere she </p><p>	danced</p><p>Out on you from the door." </p><p>Again </p><p>"  for Fame's consummate fruit, which ne'er</p><p>Has cool'd the fever of a living lip, </p><p>Which ripens slowly through laborious years, </p><p>Then, heavy with its sweetness and its bloom, </p><p>Falls on a grave, he could not wait; so pluck'd </p><p>Crude Reputation's green and bastard crab, </p><p>Which set his teeth on edge. This error soured </p><p>His native goodness." </p><p>The fatal incident in Horton's life appears to have been his love for a "lily-woman," who is lost to him by drowning; but Horton with all his sorrows and the good things he gives occasion to be said of him, is light-weighted, and flits out of sight and mind before we have finished the poem. </p><p>"Squire Maurice" is better conceived, and holds a really tragic position. It is a poem of Love and Irresolution. He is plighted to a girl of low degree, but cannot summon courage to break with the world and follow the impulse of his heart. The counsels, the half resolves, the poor wisdom which outwits his better nature is well given: </p><p>"And yet the world is wise; each curve and </p><p>	round</p><p>Of custom's rond 19no result of chance; </p><p>It curves but to avoid some treacherous ground, </p><p>Some quagmire in the wilds of circumstance; </p><p>Nor safely left. The long-drawn caravan </p><p>Wavers through heat, then files o'er Mecca's </p><p>	stones;</p><p>Far in the blinding desert lie the bones </p><p>Of the proud-hearted solitary man." </p><p>A weak heart makes tragedy as well as a strong one: but here again the tragic position dissolves in talk. On looking closer at "Squire Mauris" We discover that he in not a personality: a subtle analysis, rather, of what an average human creatures would be similarly places. As a poem, "Squire Maurice" is written with a simple ease and sweetness which makes it very delightful to read, and we prefer the following natural verses to all the grand Apollodorian lines that spasmodic poet ever coined: </p><p>"Though I have travelled now for twice an hour, </p><p>I have not heard a bird or seen a flower. </p><p>This wild road has a little mountain rill </p><p>To sing to it, ah! happier than I. </p><p>How desolate the region and how still </p><p>The idle earth looks on the idle sky! </p><p>I trace the river by its wandering green,</p><p>The vale contracts to a steep pass of fear, </p><p>And through the midnight of the pines I hear </p><p>The torrent raging down the long ravine. </p><p>At last I've reached the summit high and bare; </p><p>I fling myself on heather dry and brown: </p><p>As silent as picture lies the town; </p><p>Its peaceful smokes are curling in the air; </p><p>The bay is one delicious sheet of rose, </p><p>And round the far point of the tinted cliffs </p><p>I see the long strings of the fishing skiffs </p><p>Come home to roost like lines of evening crows." </p><p>Mr. Smith does not excel in lyric verse, nor do any of the school of which he considered the chief and interpreter. We are astonished that he should have reprinted such stanzas as "The Night before the Wedding; or, Ten. Yeart After." </p><p>"The country ways are full of mire. </p><p>The boughs toss in the fading light. </p><p>The winds blow out the sunset fire, </p><p>And sudden droppeth down the night. </p><p>I sit in this familiar room, </p><p>Where mud-splashed hunting squires resort; </p><p>My sole companion in the gloom </p><p>This slowly dying pint of port." </p><p>We can pardon such epithets as the "dying day," and many of the kind made popular by Shelley; but if this grandiloquence applies to the daily ebbing of our decanters, it may extend to our legs of mutton, and will have a range of infinite bathos. We are not of those who accuse Mr. Smith of plagiarism, nor hold the accusation good. If it were so to anything like the extent charged against him, he must have a genius for mosaic-work never yet equalled in poetic literature. But let whoever will, read the above stanza, and say if it be not an almost servile echo of Tennyson! The treatment, the tone, the very rhymes, are his. Mr Smith should have been careful, where so much was expected of him, not to publish these reproductions of a master, involuntary though they may be. There is surely such a thing as poetic conscience, to warn young votaries of the Muse when they are appropriating property not their own? At all events, there are laws to restrain the practice. We have minor objection to make. Mr. Smith's frequent elisions affect the ear unpleasantly: we find pages full of 'mong, 'mid, 'neath, 'bove, 'tween, &amp;c. This can easily be corrected. We will make another, and a graver one. Mr. Smith has now </p><p>had experience of the world, and has seen more of women. The strange style of the young lady who momentarily appears in the "Boy's Poem," her shadowy, vulgar, and ridiculous ensemble make us think that he has not much penetration, and is tardy in reaching the elements of character. It is possible to sketch a flighty person with grace. In this poem, as in the others, the charm is in the descriptions. Here is one of a clear unlaboured beauty, that would of itself pass Mr. Alexander Smith's name into the rank of poets: </p><p> 	"The shining day</p><p>Spread out before me, and I wandered on, </p><p>Free as those vagrant children of the waste, </p><p>Shadow and sunshine. By the sandy banks </p><p>Of a shrunk stream, that in unnumbered rills </p><p>Tinkled 'tween pebbles and hot glistening stones, </p><p>Two green kingfishers played. A travelling shower O'ertook me on the way; I stood and heard </p><p>The skylarks singing in the sunny rain, </p><p>With a dim recognition in my heart,</p><p>As if I knew the meaning of the song </p><p>In some forgotten life. I reached a height </p><p>That lay from fairy fern to stately tree </p><p>Asleep in sunshine. From its crown I saw </p><p>The country fade into the distant sky, </p><p>With happy hamlets drowned in apple-bloom, </p><p>And ivy-muffled churches still with graves, </p><p>And restless fires subdued and tamed by day; </p><p>And scattered towns whence came at intervals, </p><p>Upon the wind, a clear sweet sound of bells. </p><p>Through all, a river, like stream of haze, </p><p>Drew its slow length until 'twas lost in woods. Still as lichened stone I lay, and watched </p><p>The lights and shadows on the landscape's face, </p><p>The moving cloud that quenched the shining </p><p>	fields,</p><p>The gilding sunbeam, the grey trailing shower, </p><p>And all the commerce of the earth and sky. </p><p>With weary limbs at sunset returned; </p><p>And in the dingy fringes of the town, </p><p>The helpless languor of the Sabbath eve, </p><p>The listless groups that stood around the doors, </p><p>The silent children, and the smoke that rose </p><p>Lazy and spiritless into the air, </p><p>Told the world's sinews had been overwrought, </p><p>And now hung lax and loose. My spirits fell, </p><p>Sheer as skylark when his song o'er: </p><p>I crept into my little twilight room, </p><p>And there my day of glory set in tears." </p><p>The healthiest sign in this volume is, that the </p><p>poet has not been polishing and cutting gems to his verse. He is not, we are glad to see, corrupted by the noxious applause of many of the critics who first welcomed him: he has written right on the best that was in him. Public taste has much advanced since we had the "Life Drama," thanks to the intolerable outrages on English common sense and language of which the spasmodic poets became guilty. </p><p>That it does not condemn and reject the "City Poems," but accepts them, however disappointing, as a proof of sensible progress in Art, must satisfy Mr. Smith that he is in the right track, and be the present reward for his efforts. </p><p>Our quarterly supply of verse is unfailing, and of the unsual quality. We must except and select one volume which contains something more than verse, and seems to us particularly hopeful a collection of poems2 by Edward Wilberforce and Edmumd F. Blanchard. Mr. Blanchard's contributions are graceful trifles, evidently thrown in to fill up his friend's volume. They show considerable ease of versification, and an inoffensive flippancy on which metre may act as a fortunate restraint. The poems of Mr. Wilberforce are distinguished by a fulness and sustained strength rare in a first publication. Perhaps he might as well have left the seventeenth canto of Don Juan unsung. He certainly attests the truth of Byron's lines: </p><p>	"Sometimes</p><p>Kings are not more imperative than rhymes." </p><p>But kings and rhymes are most unmanageable when we attempt to command them; and in spite of Mr. Wilberforce's dexterity, he has now and then to resort to imperious measures. The canto is curious and clever, but reads like time lost when we find what much better things he can do. The "Field's Secret" is a powerful story told in ten-syllable couplets, and with a sway and perspicuity of language highly creditable to a young writer. Mr. Wilberforce has studied Wordsworth to some purpose, the least dangerous of all preceptors to a youthful poet, and one whose sound and sonorous English, reverence for his art, and eternal dealing with the well-heads of Nature, can do nothing but good to a young and imaginative mind, little likely, by virtue of its ardour, to be misled into his vice of prosing. The lines, a "Gorge in the Alps," compose a piece of fine natural description, and close with a grandeur of simple eloquence unaccustomed in the days of Festus and Firmilian. Our space allows us to quote a portion only:</p><p>"We crouched for shelter 'neath the dripping </p><p>	eaves,</p><p>While raged the storm without, and through the </p><p>	mist,</p><p>That hung upon the mountain's skirts, and cloth- </p><p>	ed</p><p>The pines with priestly vestments, Ecarce descried </p><p>The other bank, where the frail blue bells droop- </p><p>	ed</p><p>Beneath the pitiless hail; at last the fog </p><p>Swept by in serried columns, like the march </p><p>Of some victorious army, and we heard </p><p>The tramp of hailstones faint and fainter grow, </p><p>Till nothing broke the silence of the scar </p><p>But the slow drip from eave, and rock, and </p><p>	branch.</p><p>Again we sallied out: our footsteps fell </p><p>With muffled plash upon the sodden clay; </p><p>We saw the weeping tresses of the larch </p><p>Sway to the ground and veil the graceful stem, </p><p>As tho' Godiva found a Daphne's tomb  </p><p>Purest of Dryads: hero the mountain ash </p><p>With clustered corals dipped in liveliest red, </p><p>New washed, and showering pearls to every </p><p>	wind,</p><p>Quivering with delight: the streaming fir </p><p>Through its soaked bark distilled a fresher </p><p>	scent."</p><p>2 "Poems." By Edward Wilberforce and Edmund Foster Blanchard. London: Longman and Co. 1857. </p><p>We have to admire here the flow and modulation of the verse, and the qniet descriptive power; and for a first effort we see more promise in these solid qualifications than if the poem bristled with conceits. Mr. Wilberforce feels with his own heart, and sees with his own eyes. He must not be dismayed to find his book meet with little attention. It is not of a kind to raise a fictitious sensation. The germ of excellence is in it, but what form and direction that excellence may take we shall not attempt to predict. Possibly one who writes English, and thinks it, so clearly, may turn to satire. The volume indicates that he has a taste that way. There is now an opening for a good satiric poet. We are all of us too comfortable bards and reviewers. </p><p>As far as it was in art to illustrate a poet so exquisitely pictorial as Tennyson, the three chiefs of the pre-Raphaelites have succeeded.3 They have each in his own way, and with extreme conscientiousness and care, presented something of the poet's meaning, never failing from want of depth to read him. That they have not satisfied the public is less a fault of theirs than a proof of the difficulty of the undertaking. It was an easy task to illustrate Byron </p><p>and Moore. Wild Irish girls and amorous angels; Brian Born trampling the Sassenach, love triumphing in and out of win and Greece; stalwart figures in mantles and moustaches, bearing a strong family likeness to those of Clarke's series, admired in our infancy: these, with the regular features and bosoms of British beauty, were sufficiently suggestive to satisfy us, and did not require deep subtlety to conceive and depict. The peculiarity of Tennyson, and the singularity of his genius, is that he never draws a picture without dipping it in a thought, or suffusing it with a profound sensation. Hence the picture becomes accepted in the memory not only as a landscape that we have looked at visually, but have felt with emotion. He more than his fellows, has cast on natural scenery</p><p>"The light that never was on sea or land </p><p>The consecration and the poet's dream." </p><p>"The Moated Grange," the dreary moorland of "Locksley Hall," the "waste fens and windy fields," the glaring desolation of "Mariana in the South," the pastoral repose in "The Miller's Daughter," the pensive twilight eve, and "wild March morning" in "The May Queen," the half glimpses of old England in "Godiva," and the "Talking Oak," the lovelorn splendours in " none," the weird winter night with its "tingling stars," which looked down on King Arthur and Sir Bedivere, a word of the poet conjures all these varied images before us in passionate clearness: his spell is on us, and it is vain for Art to attempt to rival these vivid impressions. The wonder is that Messrs. Millais, Hunt, and Rosetti have not failed more signally, and shocked our prejudiced views altogether. </p><p>3 "Poems." By Alfred Tennyson, D. C. L., Poet Laureate. Illustrated edition. London: Moxon, Dover-street. 1857. </p><p>How utterly they might have done so is shown </p><p>by the companion efforts of Mr. Horsley, and, </p><p>we regret to add, Mr. Mulready. None but </p><p>Tennyson can play on Tennyson's instrument. </p><p>Still it is unfair in such a case to be exacting, and the book contains drawings that are very charming, apart from any relation to the poetry. Oriental Kief is given with the hand of one who knows the East, by Holman Hunt, in the "Recollections of tho Arabian Nights." We wish he hod made as a present of the Persian girl as well. His Godiva, unloosing the "wedded eagles of her belt," and surrounded in her bower by what may be taken for prying eyes, is chastely and beautifully conceived. There is wildness, and the 6ense of a charm snapped tragically in his "Lady of Shalott," but it is quite a different web from the one that flew out and "floated wide," and the sweet and dim romance of the poem is missed. The two Oriana-drawings are the best of the illustrations; the second, with the stern Norse warrior stooping over and passionately kissing the sculptured effigy, on the tombstone of his slain bride the snow-covered ground and white rocks skirting the northern sea aronnd is very noble, and worthy of Tennyson. </p><p>Rosetti's drawings aro intensely medi val </p><p>and mystic; but this artist has the sense of beauty so deeply seated, that we admire oven when we do not always understand him. The weeping queens watching King Arthur in the vale of Avelon are lovely and queen-like women; so is the face of the Lady of Shalott, who has sung her last song: the attitude of Lancelot also is profoundly tender, and the drawing is crowded with suggestive accessories. Rosotti improves on Tennyson too much; but if we forget the poetry his drawings affect to illustrate, and take them for what they are, we shall find that each one is a poem in itself, and despite the quaintness aud excessive richness, a poem that we may cherish and enjoy, or we are beneath the artist's level. The fervid devotion of "Mariana in the South," kissing the Saviour's feet, and the ecstasy of the rapt St. Cecilia under the Angel's salute, are due to a man of genius who may be too much given to symbolic elaborations, but who comprehends beauty with his whole soul, and can represent the highest and the noblest forms of grace. True feminine visages are the key-notes to the pictures, and if we fix our attention on them, we shall no longer feel offended by tho pedantic fulness of detail. And yet we hardly like to object to that which furnishes so wonderful a medieval study.</p><p>Mr. Millais is unequal, of course: here, as in </p><p>the Academy Exhibition, in one place he nearly </p><p>accomplishes perfection, and in another he is as </p><p>poor as Horsley. The two drawings to the "Miller's Daughter" are miserable below criticism and contempt: those affixed to the "Sisters" are finely imaginative; the square black turret, the bending poplars, and the windy bar of cloud across the moon, admirably suggest the ballad. Equally good is " St. Agnes' Eve," with the figure of the pure girl whose breath to Heaven "like vapour goes" from the serene coldness of the convent into the wintry air. In "Dora," the scene between William and his father is a specimen of the forcible feeble. The old man is sketched as an irritated miser, and William's out line is that of a somewhat tigerly collegian scapegrace. Mr. Millais has fallen into a common error in his drawing of Cleopatra. The "queen with swarthy cheeks and bold black eyes" was not negrine. She had no cause to he even olive-tawny. Cleopatra was a danghter of Ptolemy, a Greek; and tho Egyptian climate would never have burnt and burnished her white blood to anything like the extent insisted upon by the artist. Indeed, custom would have soon "staled her infinite variety" had she been a nigger. She is absolutely made to point with a black finger to a black breast, which no sensible aspick would touch. The poet has not altogether insulted her memory and the taste of tho Roman generals by giving her "swarthy cheeks," though it may be questioned how far that may be admissible; but the artist does nothing but outrage to tho shade of Mark Antony. Mr. Millais has, moreover, made her expose her teeth doubtless to get a little light into his drawing; but it wears the aspect of a curious case of insistance, as if tha glorious beauty must not only be black like Dinah, but grin in sisterhood. Historic and intuitive evidence, Mr. Millais, tells us that the Serpent of old Nile was fair. The most destructive women are always fair. </p><p>The drawings contributed by Stanfield and Croswick might have been done as well by inferior artists. They are very pretty, and some of Stanfield's very beautiful. Creswick's illustration to the lines, "Move Eastward, happy Earth," and Stanfield's to "Break, break, break!" seem to us the most successful, for there the bare hint is left for them to fill up. "Ulysses setting sail from Ithaca" is a charming sketch of the latter artist. His  nouo wants the majesty conveyed by the lines</p><p>"Behind the valley topmost Gargarus </p><p>Stands up and takes the morning, but in front </p><p>The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal </p><p>Troas, and Dion's column'd citadel, </p><p>The crown of Troas." </p><p>Mr. Mulready's "Life and Thought" is conoeivod and drawn with exceeding delicacy. His "Will Waterproof" at the Cock can only be summed as stupid. His "Syrens" might be taken for British dames of light character burlesquing on a part of our coast, and hailing a trawler. Of Mr. Horsley we have spoken, and wish to say no more. Mr. Maclise represents himself with unswerving constancy. On the whole, it is a good gift-book for those who love pictures even for those who love the poet. </p><p>Several Handbooks to the Art Treasure Exhibition, more or less instructive, demand a cursory notice. That to the "Paintings by Ancient Masters"4 is an unsatisfactory guide, not very aoute or olear in its criticisms, and written with dulness. Why are not the critical articles on Old Masters that appeared in the Times reprinted? They possessed all that this Handbook lacks in breadth of judgment and interest.</p><p>4 "A Handbook to the Paintings by Ancient Masters in the Art Treasures Exhibition. Reprinted from the Manchester Guardian. London: Bradbury and Evans. 1857. </p><p>The Handbooks to the "Museum of Ornamental Art,"5 by Mr. Waring, and to The Armoury,"6 by Mr. Planch , are the work of competent men. The "Water Colours, Drawings, and Engravings,"7 and the Handbook to the "British Portrait Gallery,"8 are written upon the best principles of Art-criticism, with an eloquence which does with an appreciative the not impair perception, and </p><p>with an appreciative generosity that is, nevertheless, no curb on the writer's boldness and just distribution of honours. The "British Portrait Gallery" forms almost pocket History of England and its portrait painters: biography, anecdote, and criticism go hand-in-hand, and make it the friendliest guide to the pictures that could be had, and pleasant companion, apart from its specific use. </p><p>It is perhaps unfair ask the opponents of Mr. Ruskin's theories of Art to prove their acquaintance with its first principles, and their claim to enter into contention with him, by giving the public a book as good as "Elements of Drawing;"9 but we apprehend that they will no longer deny to him that knowledge of the of Art which the basis of sound criticism, even when they despise his judgment and contest his assumptions. A better instructor could not be placed in the hands of the young beginner of Art. It will do for him all that the drawing-masters fail to do and that well-nigh everything. He will learn, with the very first lines he draws, the value and meaning of shade; and following his admirable and patient guide, he will have his eye imperceptibly educated in nature. Learning to see things as they are, he is by gradual slow degrees taught to render them as they are to be rendered. He is instructed, as he advances, to read and to speak the language of Art, the language of earth and sky, and of the greatest who have breathed our breath. The eloquence of the writing will be a spur to his energies; and its extreme lucidity will leave him nothing to desire in the way of explanation of particulars. Accompanied by this book, the student has friend in his wanderings over hill and dale in the depth of country peace, and in the heart of beauty; a friend gentle, wise, and most inspiriting. The dogmas here are many, but they do not bite young people. Mr. Ruskin's dogmatism is the direct one-view of a profound conviction founded on reverent study, and the act of seeing and thinking </p><p>5 "Handbook to the Museum of Ornamental Art in the Art Treasures Exhibition," By J.

There are two or three touches ot sarcasm to relieve the dryness of instruction, of a kind to make little ladies giggle and grave women look fond. They do not hurt: but the following passage addresses itself too much to the class which laughs outright at anything the master stresses and says with intent. He is speaking of the economy of colour in nature: </p><p>"Sometimes I have really thought her miserliness intolerable; in a gentian, for instance, the way she economizes her ultramarine down in the bell is a little too bad."</p><p>This, of course, is only pleasantry, and does well in the school to show that the superior can </p><p>unbend and be mortal: it shows also that the naturalistic teacher feels himself strong enough to trifle with the enemy; but out of this school does not do. We are inclined to quarrel with the Appendix somewhat. Mr. Ruskin has no right to dogmatize on poetry and poets. He recommends Lowell, Longfellow, and Coventry Patmore to young people, excluding Coleridge as "sickly and useless," and Shelley as "shallow and verbose." Shelley has faults, and so has Coleridge; but this off-hand dictum is an impertinence nothing less. Besides, there are </p><p>nobler poets than the above three for the young to read. We do not think that there was need for a caution against fiction and the drama. Shakspeare is the drama in England, and surely </p><p>he may be read by the young? We fancy it is for a very feminine order of mind that Conventry Patmore is made to supersede Shakspeare. Or does Mr. Ruskin mean that our youth should carefully shun theatres and shows and sights? Apart from these blemishes, the "Elements of Drawing" is </p><p>a useful book; one that will be come the art-student's manual. It has the approbation of all enlightened artists. </p><p>A quarterly reviewer of novels has frequently address his readers when the works under consideration have been perused and their contents distributed to the winds in newspaper extracts. It is seldom his part to introduce the characters and unravel the plot. A novel like </p><p>"Barchester Towers,"10 for instance, is pretty sure to have gone the round of the circulating library before anything we may have to say touching its merits will be heard; and we can hardly expect to assist in extending its circulation in its present form, when we state our opinion of it as decidedly the cleverest novel of the season, and one of the most masculine delineations of modern life in a special class of society that we have seen for many a day. Those who have read its dashing predecessor, "The Warden," will be quite up to the style and the story, which are both continued vigorously in "Barchester Towers," and with renewed interest. We recommend novel readers, who have not yet made acquaintance with Mr. Trollope, to get the two books immediately. As they are </p><p>likely to be few, and it is our duty to occupy ourselves with the majority, we shall speak of </p><p>10 "Barchester Towers." By Anthony Trollope, Author of "The Warden." 3 vols. London: Longmans. 1857. </p><p>"Barchester Towers" as a work well known. Mr. Trollope has satisfactorily solved a problem in this production. He has, without resorting to politics, or setting ont as a social reformer, given us a novel that men can enjoy, and a satire so cleverly interwoven with the story, that every incident and development renders it more pointed and telling. In general our modern prose satirists spread their canvass for a common tale, out of which they start when the occasion suits, to harangue, exhort, and scold the world in person. Mr. Trollope entrusts all this to the individuals of his story. The plot is as simple as the siege of Troy. We are sure that Mr. Slope cannot succeed, or that if he is allowed to, another three volumes will confound him. We are equally convinced that the Widow Bold will never surrender to him, or that if she should, he will have to repent it equally. Nevertheless, our appetite for the closing chapters does not languish. We are anxious for the widow, and long to get her havened out of her perilous </p><p>widowhood in fast wedlock: man's great ambition to become a Bishop, and woman's wonderful art in ruling one, cannot fail to interest us exceedingly, and we hurry on without a halt to the overthrow of Slope and the rare act of self-immolation whereby the Rev. Mr. Harding refuses a deanery, value a considerable sum per annum, and bestows it on his son-in-law. The story is original in books, but common in the land: so is the villain. Mr. Slope is possessed of extraordinary powers. He cannot move without inspiring nausea even in the female bosom (for it is notorious how much the sex can bear); yet he contrives to make men jealous of him. We have all of us met somebody like Mr. Slope, and wished that, if he indeed could lay claim to the odour of sanctity, it were pleasanter to the poor human sense of smell.</p><p>"Mr. Slope is tall, and not ill made. His feet and hands are large, as has ever been the case with all his family, but he has a broad chest and wide shoulders to carry off the excrescences, and on the whole his figure is good. His countenance, however, is not specially prepossessing. His hair is lank, and of a dull pale-reddish hue. It is always formed into three straight lumpy masses, each brushed with admirable precision, and cemented with much grease; two of them adhere closely to the sides of his face, and the other lies at right angles above them. He wears no whiskers, and is always punctiliously shaven. His face is nearly of the same colour as his hair, though perhaps a little redder; it is not unlike beef beef, however, one would say, of a bad quality. His forehead is capacious and high, but square and heavy, and unpleasantly shining. His mouth is large, though his lips are thin and bloodless; and his high, prominent, pale brown eyes inspire anything but confidence. His nose, however, is his redeeming feature; it is pronounced straight nnd well formed, though I myself should have liked it better did it not possess a somewhat spongy, porous appearance, as though it had been cleverly formed out of a red coloured cork. I never could endure to shake hands with Mr. Slope. A cold, clammy perspiration always exudes from him; the small drops are to be seen standing ou his brow, and his friendly </p><p>grasp is unpleasant." </p><p>Mr. Trollope seems wanting in certain of the higher elements that make a great novelist. He does not exhibit much sway over the emotional part of our nature: though fairer readers maythink that the pretty passages between Eleanor and her baby-boy show a capacity for melting woman's heart, at least. He is also a little too sketchy; the scenes are efficient in repose and richness: but let us cut short our complaints, thankful that we have a caustic and vigorous writer, who can draw men and women, and tell a story that men and women can read. </p><p>We could not oppose a greater contrast to </p><p>"Barchester Towers," than "The Athelings."11 It is in construction and execution altogether feminine. Two sisters and ono brother, a father, a mother, and baby-twins, lived in Islington and comfort on two hundred a year. The elder sister is an authoress; the younger a beauty; the brother is a boisterous boy who gets articled in a lawyer's office, and helps by his acumen and energy to save the family property and defeat the bad man of the book. Lord Winterbourne; the twins remain subordinate, and come in for the ladies' petting; the father and mother are also in the background. Now, Mr. Trollope has a distinct intrigue on foot, which the reader never loses sight of, and the characters successively help to unfold it; but the authoress of the "Athelings" has nothing of the sort, and we have to look through her three volumes again and again to discover how it is she can possibly have contrived to spin out dreary conversation to such an extent as to till them, and preserve a vestige of interest. The secret is that the novel is addressed to the British Home, and it seems that we may prose everlastingly to the republic of the fireside. When, towards the end of the second volnme, we are made aware that the beauty has a chance of marrying a lord, we prick up our ears and plunge freshly once more into seas of household gossip. When, half through the third volume, it is hinted to us that her sister, the genius for so the writer of a novel is called is destined to bring back a sceptic clergyman to his rectory and the true creed, we buckle up and come in gallantly at the death, scarcely sensible of the monstrous fatigues we huve undergone. But the book finished, will any one venture to resume acquaintance with it? The Authoress is clever: she can describe society: Mr. Agar, the old epicurean exquisite, and Mrs. Edgerly, the vapid woman of fashion, are well touched; and there is a dainty naturalness in the sisters which makes it pleasant to remember them. Her main fault has killed the most charmingly written hooks, and this lady has only to practise compression to become an excellent novelist.</p><p>In "Labour and Live"12 we have a quiet sensible tale, the moral of which is suggested by the title. It has the merit of being in one volume, but even here the dilution of ordinary incidents in floods of coloquy would enable it to bear cut- </p><p>11 "The Athelings, or the Three Gifts." By Margarat Oliphant. 8 vols. Blackwood and Sons. Edinburgh and London. 1857. </p><p>12 "Labour and Love." A story by the author of "Blenham." London: William Freeman. 1857. </p><p>ting down by half. The characters are skilfully delineated. </p><p>The Author of "Farina"13 has exposed himself to a somewhat trying ordeal. Last year he treated us to a delightful volume of well-sustained oriental extravagance, and we remember our friend Shibli Bagarag too well to be easily satisfied with any hero less astonishing. It was refreshing to leave the actual and the probable for a time, and follow Mr. Meredith's lead into the bright world of imagination. The hope of such another enchanted holiday prepared us to welcome his new tale with all due honour and cordiality. Tt was with something like disappointment, therefore, that we found ourselves brought down to the vulgar limits of time and place, and our appetite for the marvellous entirely spoilt by scenes which challenge prosaic considerations of historical truth and the fitness of things. The title "Farina: a Legend of Cologne," will naturally carry the reader's mind to those ungainly-shaped bottles, with which the British tourist is sure to return laden from the city of evil smells. Mr. Meredith is pleased to bestow a high antiquity on tho famous distillation, and his hero, doubtless the first of all the Jean Maries, is invested with the dubious honours of a dealer in the black art, on account of his suspicious collection of bottles and vases, pipes and cylinders. But when the Devil is beaten in single combat on the Drachenfels, and returns from whence he came, entering to his kingdom under the Cathedral Square, and leaving behind him a most abominable stench, Farina's perfumed water does good service. The kaiser, six times driven back by the offence to his nostrils, is enabled to enter the good city of Cologne, and then and there reward the restorer of a pure atmosphere with the hand of his long-loved bride. For the rest, the story is sufficiently slight. We have the blonde and bewitching heroine, Margarita, and her troop of lovers, who prove their devotion by such strenuous interchange of blows in her honour, that there is not one, of them who is not black and blue; and we have the lover, Farina, tender and true, brave as Siegfried, and worshipping his "Frankinne" with such fanatical homage, as "Conrad the Pious" might have sung. Margarita's father, Gottlieb Groschen, the rich Cologne citizen, is a characteristic specimen of the prosperous medi val Rhinelander, and we cannot give our readers a more favourable specimen of Mr. Meredith's style than by introducing the father and daughter, engaged in receiving that nuisance of the middle as of all ages morning visitors: </p><p>"A clatter in the Cathedral Square brought Gottlieb on his legs to the window. It was a company of horsemen sparkling in harness. One trumpeter rode on the side of the troop, and in front a standard-bearer, matted down the chest with ochre beard, displayed aloft to the good citizens of Cologne, three brown hawks, with birds in their beaks, on an azure star-dotted field. 'Holy Cross!' exclaimed Gottlieb, low in his throat, 'the arms of Werner! Where got he money to mount his men? Why, this is daring all Cologne in our very teeth! 'Fend that he visit me now! Ruin smokes</p><p>18 "Farina : a Legend of Cologne." By George Meredith. London : Smith, Elder, and Co. 1857. </p><p>in that ruffian's track. I've felt hot and cold by turns all day.' The horsemen came jingling carelessly along the street in scattered twos and threes, laughing together, and singling out the maidens at the gable-shadowed window with hawking eyes. They were in truth ferocious-looking fellows. Leather, steel, and dust, clad them from head to foot; big and black as bears; wolf-eyed, fox-nosed. They glistened bravely in the falling beams of the sun, and Margarita thrust her fair braided yellow head a little forward over her father's shoulder, to catch the whole-length of the grim cavalcade. One of the troop was not long in discerning the young beauty." </p><p>They come to tho door with a "thundering smack," and one is perforce admitted:  </p><p>"Margarita heard 'wafted in a thunder of oaths,''Tis the maiden we want; let's salute her and begone! or cap your skull with something thicker than you've on it now, if you want a whole one happy father!' 'Gottlieb von Groschen I am,' answered her father, 'and the Kaiser ' 'Sas fond of a pretty girl as we are! Down with her, and no more drivelling! It's only for a moment, old Measure and Scales!' 'I tell you, rascals, I know your master, and if you're not punished for this, may I die a beggar!' exclaimed Gottlieb, jumping with rage. 'May you die as rich as an abbot! And so you will, if you don't bring her down, for I've sworn to see her; there's the end of it, man!" </p><p>Fearing violence to her father, Margarita comes down her brutal admirer explains:  </p><p>I'm no ninny, and not to be diddled; I'll talk to the young lady! Silence out there! all's going proper;' this to his comrades through the door. 'So, my beautiful maiden thus stands: We saw you at the window, looking like fresh rose with a gold crown on.' . . . 'Schwartz Thier!' says Henker Kothhals to me, 'I'll wager you odds you don't kiss of that fine girl within twenty minutes counting from the hand smack!' 'Done,' was my word, and we clapped our fists together. Now you see, that's straightforward!'" </p><p>How Margarita escapes this indignity, how she becomes the captive of the terrible Werner himself, and how she is rescued, we have not space to tell; much clever and vigorous description is to be found in the narrative, and Mr. Meredith has been very successful in setting before vivid picture of the coarse, rough manners, the fierce, warlike habits, and the deep-seated superstition of the "good old times" of chivalry. The character of the jovial Squire Guy the Goshawk, especially well done. As a </p><p>whole, we think "Farina" lacks completeness, and the ghostly element is not well worked in. The combat between Saint Gregory and the Devil is </p><p>made ludicrous by its circumstantiality. It was not as jeering satirist that the old monkish legends set forth Sathanas, and there is a clumsiness in the whole affair which accords ill with the boldness and skill displayed in other portions of the tale. We must also protest against Father Gregory's use of the nominative case " ye" instead of the accusative "you," monk though he be, and privileged doubtless to speak bad grammar at will; nor can we admire many passages in which the Author has sacrificed euphony, and almost sense, to novelty and force of expression. With these blemishes, "Farina" is both an original and an entertaining book, and will be read with pleasure by all who prefer a lively, spirited story to those dull analyses of dull experiences in which the present school of fiction abounds.</p><p>"Lucian Playfair"14 is a protest against all forms of mal-administration civil, religious, military, marine, and medical. Story Mr. Mackorn has not much to tell; but he has a great deal of energy, a great deal of indignation, some fooling for nature, and a copious store of language; and thus armed, a man with the remotest notion of plot may furnish an acceptable three volumes now-a-days. The opening chapter preludes with spirit. Master Lucian has swallowed a small wooden soldier "violently dislodged from a sentry-box of the same material," and is suffering grievously. He is subjected to the attentions of Dr. Amos Playfair, and Mrs. Mottle, "a slightly exaggerated specimen of the sisterhood tolerated in too indulgent English society under the misnomer of nurses: a class of women in the main, fawning, selfish, and tyrannical, the bane of nurseries, an added horror to the catalogue of miseries indigenous to the sick room." She was a shawled and clogged rival of Pandora, and on the boa of that malignant goddess affected to set her seal potent in her own private, opinion as that of Suleiman, the son of D aod, so honourably named in the "Thousand and One Nights," or the quack stamp of the "enlightened British Government." This exaggerated specimen, on being introduced to Lucian in tho Doctor's absence, is </p><p>desirous of operating on the tormented infant hero with a dose of Child's Peace, an efficacious and much-eulogized compound, sold for 2s. 9d., 4s. 6d., 11s., and 32s. the bottle; the largest the cheapest: foundling hospitals and orphan asylums allowed twenty-five per cent." Her sinister counsels and eloquent exposition of the attributes of the "Peace" are on the point of overcoming the ill-educated mamma's reluctance to permit a trial of its virtues; she is absolutely in the act of pouring some "Peace" down, little Lucian's throat, when who shall say it is possible to give an exaggerated specimen of a faithful dog? Jack, a dappled terrier, long her enemy, and now thoroughly outraged, can hold </p><p>his vigilant watch over the proper application of medicines to the person of the hero no further. He snaps at Mrs. Mottle's finger. It was time! Dr. Amos, who, concealed, has witnessed the entire scene, emerges from his retirement triumphantly, and Messrs. Daffy, James, and Holloway, and the Professor Morrison, retire from the nursery in confusion, defeated by the race canine. After this episode of tho faithful dog we expect something stirring, but we do not come to it; we lose sight of Lucian, and recover him in the second volume in company with a pedler, who turns out to be his cousin, and a fresh victim of the Jesuits. The adventures of the two in the slums of London, to get a clue to the pedler's early benefactor, who bears the secret of his birth, fill up the third volume. Our </p><p>14 "Lucian Playfair."

O London! London! thou that killest thy innocents in their infancy, and stranglest the sweet graces of childhood ere it can bloom; thou that nippest the budding beauty of the maiden, that causest thy women to hanker after cosmetics, and thy young men to imagine vain compensations for manly proportions; thou that deprivest thy adults of their full threescore years and ten; thou that respectest not the reverence of old age but strikest the grey and honourable heads of thy homes with premature paralysis, debility, and decay!"</p><p>A great change is coming over French works of fiction. The miserable intrigues and villanous dog-loves which have till recently formed the staple of every French novel, and disgusted the world by the exhibition of a state of corruptness bordering on profanation of all that the mind holds most sacred, are gradually disappearing. The picture must have been true in a degree, or no society could have tolerated it; but the painters were fond of strong effects, and made their colours putrid. A fashion soon spreads in French literature. In another year we shall have moral tales fit for the signature of Madame de Genlis. Already Hymen has shaken hands with Love, and where they do not agree, they are mutually respectful. Intrigue continues, but does not minister to depraving excitement: the systematic seducer takes his proper criminal rank, and the fair and frail are not so enchantingly lovely as to dazzle us into forgiveness, and throw goodness aud purity into the background. </p><p>In "Madame Bovary,"15 the husband is a fool </p><p>to his wife. To the reador he is a simple apothecary, a weak, everyday sort of character, who loves his offspring and adores the wretched </p><p>woman that deceives him. She is about equal </p><p>to him in station: his superior in intellect. </p><p>Living in a provincial town, and sighing fur the </p><p>unknown delights of Paris and splendour, her </p><p>whole nature cries out to be seduced. Of course </p><p>she does not go to her grave without being satisfied. As the German poet writes  </p><p>"Ein Thor ist immer willig, </p><p>Wenn eine Thorin wil." </p><p>15 "Madame Bovary. M urs de Province." Par Gustave Flaubert. Deuxi me  dition. Paris: Michel L vy Fr res 1857.</p><p>The old blandishing graces of Dumas, Sand, and De Balzac, are quite excluded from this story. All is severe matter of fact painfully elaborated. We flung the book to the four corners of the room; but we took it up again, and finished it. The Author is uncompromising: he gives Madame Horary successive lovers. She has not even the excuse of love and its poor consolation when the end comes. She endeavours to persuade both lovers to elope with her; she begs money of both. She plunders her husband; ruins him; finally the discovery of her treason kills him. The Author is right: if an adultery is to be treated of at all (and England cannot deny that such things really are in France), it should be laid bare not tricked out in meretricious allurements: subjected to stern analysis not made solely to present the passion, thereby to awake the sympathies of a vulgar prurience. No harm can come from reading Madame Bovary; but it is physic for adults, as the doctors say. The Author has no more love for her than an anatomist for his subject. He does not preach. He allows her patiently to make her own wickedness manifest, and leaves us to contemplate the picture at our leisure. M. Gustavo Flaubert is a singularly powerful writer. </p><p>"Madame Rose"16 is a very different person from Madame Bovary. The Author is not so remorseless a realist as M. Flaubert. His heroine is married to a stormy patrician democrat, the Comte Olivier de R thel, with whose impetuous nature she oannot find companionship or peace, and so leaves him in the thick of his conspiracies. She lives a few miles out of Paris, and is known in Herblay as Madame Rose. Here she employs her time in doing good, and in her gentle way loves Georges de Francalin, to whom she has been introduced on the occasion of his rescuing a child from the water. This is dangerous ground, both for the heroine and the novelist, but they come well out of it. Madame Rose has left her husband, but not her duty. She is prepared to sacrifice her heart and her life to him still, and wins the man who loves her to a similar devotion. What may not women do? In worse hands Georges might have been the ordinary French attendant on a married woman a Gerfaut. Madame Rose makes of him a noble fellow, and the husband's knowledge of the love between these two corresponding natures, and confidence in their loyalty, is affectingly beautiful. It was a difficult problem for a Frenchman to solve that of putting a husband in such a position without making him ridiculous. We have to thank M. Am d e Achard for his success. Madame Rose is one of the sweetest Frenchwomen we have met.</p><p>"Maurice de Treuil,"17 by the same author, is a story of a young artist of genius, who has early the choice between the path of thorns, and the path of roses: between a penurious prosecution of his art, and luxury in the lap of fortune and a wife. He leans to the path of roses, and </p><p>16 "Madame Rose. Pierre de Villergl ." Nouvelles par Am d e Achard. Paris: Hachette. 1857. </p><p>17 "Maurice de Treuil." Par Am d e Achard. Paris. Hachette. 1857. </p><p>finds it thornier than poverty. The unhappy youth has married his mother-in-law and father-in-law in the bargain, and must live with them. Henceforth there is little chance for Art: he has not a moment that he can call his own. His frivolous wife makes light presents of his pictures to her friends: he is laid under perpetual contribution for sketches by the stupid people that surround him; and on from bad to worse until, after enduring insults grievous to a highspirit, he breaks with the family. But his Sophie will not leave her mother, whom she obeys, not so much from affection, as fear and habit. To add to the calamities that befal poor Maurice, he has the misfortune to love his wife. He cannot live without her. Sophie is not quite heartless: she is touched by his love, but she dreads to offend her mother, and dislikes the idea of sharing an attic with her husband. So Maurice dies. He took the false step deliberately, and fell into the pit. He dies of something very like love. The author explains his maladythrough the mouth of a young physician: </p><p>"J'ai d j  vu plus d'un example de ces amours en quelque sorte inextinguibles. Maurice a pris la main de Sophie: il y a eu entre leur  piderme un contact myst rieux, un echange de fluide, et</p><p>toute a  t  dit. On ne combat pas de tela amours. Une certaine disposition  la tendresse et  la concentration les exalte et les rend plus forts."</p><p>The latter part of the story is told with great pathos, and the contrast to the fate of Maurice is well brought out in the characters of Philippe, his friend, and Laura, who loved him, and whom he might have married and lived a happy man. We thank M, Achard for not sullying the wife. French writers have evidently only to be decent to be delightful. </p><p>M. Ars ne Houssaye is a born Parisian, well-read, witty, and a smart philosopher. " Les Femmes comme elles sont,"18 should have been named, "Les Parisiennes comme elles sout." It is a book of clever apophthegms, scintillating brightly enough, and now and then throwing out a stronger spark. We select a few examples. </p><p>"Jusqu'  quarante ana, la femme n'a dans le c ur que quarante printemps; niais, apr s quarante ans elle a quarante hivers."</p><p>"O sagesse humaine!

Paris: L vy Fr res. 1857. </p><p>We cannot recommend the book for general reading. </p><p>Our attention has been called by the Saturday Review to some little stories that are having a great success in France. "Pour une  pingle;"19 "L'Art d' tre Malheureux;"20 and "Mignon."21 They are written with a distinct and avowed moral purpose, and are altogether idealistic in treatment, bearing, both in style and feeling, the like relation to French literature that the pictures of Edouard Fr re hold to French art, and awaking in us the same kind of tender and loving emotion towards all that is holy in domestic uses, and reverent in family bonds and religious sentiment. We cannot expect for them an influence on the literature of France such as our contemporary anticipates; but we are glad to admit that where they are read they must do good. The stories are so sweet, they breathe so pure an atmosphere, as to seem emanations of a heart full of charity: and as we read we felt grateful to an author who, without straining after virtue, can show us the best side of onr human nature in action with the world.</p><p>There is no doubt that a healthy revolution in the moral tone of fiction must proceed from fiction itself: criticism may bring the plow and the harrow, and improve the ground; but the fruit of the soil is dependent on conditions beneath the surface, and slight as they are, we welcome these little works, and the stories generally of the Biblioth que des Chemins de Fer, as flowers out of the rank, fermenting earth, indicating an impulse and a power for purer and better things. </p><p>Criticism, however, is also alive to assist the movement, by draining off the muddy waters and making a clearance of the weeds. The Academy having offered a prize for the best essay on the influence of literature on social life in France, referring particularly to novels and the theatre, the prize has been deservedly awarded to if. Eug ne Poitou; and a more systematic exposure of the vices of French novelists, a more merciless demolition of the laborious structure of paradox and declamatorv foolishness, we have never read. The essay22 does honour to the Academy whose name subscribes it. M. Poitou is a lawyer, and writes like a man accustomed to build up a case. In the announcement of the subject by the Academy, competitors were warned not to look from a literary point of view, but to consider only the teachings of the modern French novelists and dramatists, satire and personalities were interdicted. M. Poitou has known how to write strictly in accordance with these recommendations, without falling into weak generalization and obscurity. He cites the moral delinquents who have made so great a name to such pernicious ends, and exhibits </p><p>19 "Pour une Epingle." Legend, par J. T. de Saint Germain. Paris: 2e  dition.

Poitou pleads at the Academy bar against this modern heathenry, on behalf of his injured client, Society. The case is one where eloquence is not wanted: a vigorous exposition, the working of a sound judgment, is more effective. Nevertheless, M. Poitou writes well, and with that restrained warmth and measured firmness which prove how deeply he feels the importance of the cause he is advocating. He commences by an explanation of the reciprocal influences of society and literature; they are not yet harmonized in their mutual relations. In days of peace, literature ministers slavishly to the reposeof society: in troubled times it is a firebrand. All these remarks apply particularly to France, and M. Poitou takes occasion to allude to the different and happier effects in England, and also in Germany, resulting from the inborn reverence for our institutions, and rooted respect for the ties of family. The mischief done by "Werther," "Carl Moor," and " Don Juan," ruined a few lives probably, but did not shake society to its foundation. The poets were universally admired; their errors as universally condemned. In France, the genius of the Author and his vicious doctrines go together. French society, again, feels the consequences of its own natural vice of indiscriminate admiration: there is no greater tyrant than an idol. </p><p>Here is a specimen of the sort of stuff that wa9 listened to (we are happy to speak in a past tense), and of Mr. Poitou's way of dealing with it: </p><p>"Dans un roman de Mme. Sand, on lit: 'Voua vous  tes dit que les femmes comme moi avaient une sorte de grandeur incomprise; qu'elles se rachetaient devant Dieu par la puissance de leurs affections, et que, comme  Madeleine, il leur serait beaucoups pardonn  parce qu'elles out beaucoup aim .'</p><p>"Voici, enfin comment, dans le 'Juif Errant' le pr tre sclon le Christ s'exprime: 'Le Christ n'a-t-il pas interc d  aupr s de son p re pour la Madeleine p cheresse et la femme adult re?

Part of M. Poitou's system has been to make the authors thus expose their own shallowness; and although he has employed it largely, it is so successful and telling that monotony is not felt. </p><p>HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, VOYAGES, AND TRAVELS. </p><p>itself in the higher Seaweeds, the Lichens, and the Fungi; the more complete separation of these two great divisions of the organism, which is characteristic of the Hepaticae; the progressive differentiation of the vegetative apparatus into root, stem, and leaf, which, commencing in the Mosses, is more fully carried out in the Ferns, and which reaches its climax in the Flowering Plant;--all this might, we think, have been adequately expounded in an introductory chapter, with the advantage of giving the student a general insight into the typical forms of vegetable structure, and of preparing him for the reception of details in which he is not otherwise likely to feel much interest. Whilst expressing our doubts as to the expediency of thus entirely postponing the account of the Structure and Growth of Plants to the latter part of the Treatise, we have the satisfaction of being able to express the highest commendation of the manner in which this portion of it has been executed. As the Author justly remarks in his preface, "in a compendious manual of science, originality of matter has little place; the exercise of judgement, and conscientiousness in the examination of original sources, are everywhere demanded; and these are of course most beneficially employed when they rest upon an extensive basis of practical experience." Upon this principle Professor Henfrey has most consistently acted; and the consequence is that his compendious view of the Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Plants is, we will venture to say, the best that has yet appeared in any language.</p><p>The fourth part contains an outline-view of Geographical and Geological Botany; with an introductory chapter of great value, on the influence of external agencies and of the laws of vegetable development upon the diffusion of plants. </p><p>It is almost needless to add that the "getting-up" of the book is worthy of Mr. Van Poorest; our only criticism being that some of the illustrations are disproportionately large, having been originally prepared (if we mistake not) for Professor Henfrey's translation of Mohl's excellent treatise on the Vegetable Cell. </p><p>HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, VOYAGES, AND TRAVELS. </p><p>COLONEL MURE continues his useful labours in a fifth volume,2 which treats of Thucydides, Xenophon, and the remaining historians of the Attic period. These sections not only sustain the level maintained in the previous volumes, but are, in our opinion, even more valuable than their predecessors. The Author's standard of </p><p>2. "A Critical History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece." By William Mure, of Caldwell. Vol. V. London: Longman and Co. 1857. </p><p>thought is not a high one; his merit is in the fulness and consistency with which he treats his subject from the platform on which he professes to stand. His book is not written for scholars. The few discussions on special points, reserved for Appendices, want the decisive logic of first-hand scholarship. All his critical discussions, in the same way, from being without perception of the more subtle analogies, and only reaching the verbal statement examined, fall on the mind flat and unconvincing. The Greek language is apparently known to him as a well-taught scholar; but his understanding has not imbibed its genius. Nor does he appreciate this gift in others, as is shown by his sneer at Poppo (note, page 586),--a heavy and clumsy scholar, indeed, but a man evidently produced by nature for the purpose of enucleating the nodes of Thucydides. Textual criticism, however, is a minor feature of Colonel Mure's work. He addresses himself to the general reader,--to the man who has forgotten his Greek, or never learnt it, but who wishes to get a general knowledge of what Greek literature may be about, and what it may be worth. And for learners, for the sixth form at school, and the college student in his first or second year, it is precisely the book wanted. It will become, we may safely predict, the standard book on the subject in all school libraries. </p><p>Perhaps, however, the Author will not be satisfied with such praise, and intended to be judged by a higher standard. It may be necessary, therefore, to say that this is a test that it will not bear. As a school-book it is excellent. But it is no more than a school-book with a somewhat ambitious title, and full-grown dimensions. Neither the taste of the finished scholar, nor the curiosity of the philosophic student of men, will find either scope to move in, or sympathy to animate, in the tuition of Colonel Mure. He is eminently sensible and judicious; most estimable qualities in life, but of the least possible account in penetrating the subtle atmosphere in which the Greek mind and character moved. Colonel Mure's impartiality is quite judicial; his rectitude of opinion unfailing. Yet, Greeks being the subject, we find we learn more from Grote when he is wrong, than from Mure when he is right. Mure, for instance, controverts Grove's quixotic paradox on the "Character of Cleon," and on the "Trial of the Six Generals." We suppose all competent persons would side with Mure against Grote in these two cases; but it will not certainly be in consequence of Colonel Mure's Cummings up. We have not noticed in the present volume a single decision of any importance from which we desire to dissent, but a painful and restrained effect is produced upon the reader of his distance from the objects he is endeavouring to contemplate. The dispassionate and prosaic calmness of Colonel Mure disables, instead of aiding, the imagination. The figures are so distinct to the eye that we see but too clearly that they are not the Greeks of 4000 years ago, but men who lived in the last century, or in the 17th century, or in any century since the Creation. That element is altogether left out, which differentiates Greek from that which is not Greek; that to which Schiller so happily alludes:-- </p><p>314 History, Biography, Voyages, and Travels. Oct </p><p>"Ach! da euer Wonnedienst noch gl nzte, Wie ganz anders, anders war es da!" </p><p>The thorough respectability of the British office who shaves himself to perfection, brushes his hat neatly, and goes to the family pew every Sunday, has as little as possible in common with an Athenian Alcibiades. Colonel Mure, however, has not to deal much with political characters. His subject is the writers of Greece. And here his want of sympathy with greatness is chiefly felt in his total incapacity to appreciate great intellect, or to calculate the orbit of thought in its more distant flights. In his former volumes, his two great failures were--Homer and Herodotus. In the case of Homer, this failure may be ascribed to a want of realizing the conditions of an age when the poetic was the universal form and medium of thought. The "Thucydides" of the present volume leaves upon our minds a sense of blank disappointment. It is not error, but inadequacy. To what Colonel Mure does say we may give our assent; but an imperfect picture becomes a false picture when the object represented is a great mind. The inferior and commonplace merits of the Thucydidean history, those excellences, which many others besides Thucydides have reached, are set out by Colonel Mure with his usual fulness and completeness of analysis. But of the peculiar elevation from which Thucydides viewed human affairs, we have no account taken. It would be an interesting task to submit the "History of the Peloponnesian War" to a scrutiny, having for its object to read it in the mind of the writer. It has been said by a recent writer, that the celebrated historians have been men of greatly inferior power to the celebrated cultivators of physical science. The truth is, the mass of historical writers have belonged to one of two classes. They have either been literary historians, recommending by the graces of style a narrative compiled from other books, or they have been men of the world, who have described that which themselves have seen, or done. Thucydides is among the few who superadded to the union of both these qualifications--viz., a literary education, and experience of affairs--some degree of philosophical and political discipline. He does not intrude the speculation into his narrative, or expound any system of thought; but his estimate of men and their doings is governed by such a system. From Colonel Mure, however, we can gather nothing beyond the vague and superficial statements that in "his political opinions he was opposed to pure democratic government," and that in religion he was "a thorough free-thinker." We should infer from this that Colonel Mure's view was, that Thucydides, like many men of the world, had discarded with disgust the popular creed without supplying its place with any other occupation of the action of Deity on the affairs of earth. No philosophical reader will, we are sure, think that this negation of thought--possible enough in the occupied man--is the state of mind of the contemplative, speculative exile.</p><p>In saying that Colonel Mure has not done Thucydides justice, it is not implied that he has intentionally depreciated him; on the contrary, he means to make him great, but cannot state in what his greatness consists. The following passage will exhibit at once his good wishes and the vagueness of his admiration:-- </p><p>"One remark remains to be added, in which it is believed few practised students of Thucydides will refuse to concur, and which may go far to palliate any apparent harshness of the judgement passed in these pages on his literary style; the longer his work is known, and the more it is read, the more it is liked and admired; the less sensible we become of its faults, the more highly we prize its merits. This 'improvement on better acquaintance,' to use a familiar phrase, is a common, if not an infallible test of excellence in literature and art. In poetry and prose, as in painting, music, architecture, the works which command the most durable admiration are seldom those which have produced the most favourable first impression. As the conceptions of genius, especially of eccentric genius, necessarily range at times in an eccentric sphere, it seems but natural that a certain effort should be required to enable other minds fully to apprehend or appreciate them. The form in which the eccentricity of Thucydides is chiefly displayed, is the contrast between the enigmatical subtlety of thought and expression that pervades one large portion of his text, and the clear common sense and sound judgement which animates the remainder. His rhetorical passages may indeed be said to be composed in a language of his own--a language so different from that of ordinary men, that to ordinary men much appears hard to comprehend, and, even where intelligible, grates at first on the ear and understanding. But on more familiarity with the whole idiomatic ideas are embodied, the difficulties at first experienced are gradually smoothed down, and in great part sooner or later vanish altogether; the intrinsic worth of the matter is more thoroughly felt and valued--the harshness of the manner is forgotten or overlooked."--p. 178. </p><p>The 180 pages allotted to Thucydides are followed by 800 on Xenophon. This distribution of space so unjust to the merits of the two historians, will not, however, be complained of; for in Xenophon, Colonel Mure found a congenial subject. Xenophon, whose "art of composition, like his genius at large, is the perfection of mediocrity," is entirely within the analytic powers of his present biographer. We have never seen, certainly not in English, so complete an examination, and so judicious an estimate, of Xenophon. We have to distinguish in Xenophon the soldier and the man of letters.. We cannot enough admire the tact and versatile skill of the leader of the Ten Thousand in that wonderful retreat, which, unlike many Greek exploits, seem the more marvellous the better we become acquainted with it. But our accomplished captain of condottieri was also a man of letters. Poetry excepted, he assayed nearly every species of composition, and ventured with equal confidence on every subject--history, biography, political theory, finance, economics, philosophy, hunting, "omni novit." Were it not that these diffuse and feeble compositions are written in pure Greek, and relate to the Greeks, they would all have been long ago sunk in oblivion. Xenophon's best performance is the "Anabasis," his worst the "Memorabilia." The "Hellenics" </p><p>1857. History, Biography, Voyages and Travels.  315</p><p>are saved only because other histories of the period are wanting. Colonel Mure has given an excellent summary of this work. But he does not seem aware of the worthlessness of political history as viewed and recorded by second-rate men. He does not make the reader feel he does not feel himself the immense gulf between a Thucydides and a Xenophon. The fallacy of the doctrine, that it is sufficient to be a contemporary of the events described to make a good historian, is exemplified in Xenophon's historical pieces. The leader of the Ten Thousand was certainly no ordinary man. An Athenian by birth, but a resident in the Peloponnese, the friend of all the leading Spartans, he had the best opportunities for information, if information were all that is wanted. But information is no use without the eyes to read it with. Colonel Mure ascribes the defects of the Hellenics "to partiality," or "want of truthfulness," and ascribes to him an "extensive knowledge of human character." It would be truer to say that he was disqualified as an historian, by his want of power to appreciate the great men and events by whom he was surrounded. And of his discernment of character, what are we to think of the man who, having lived with Socrates, had nothing to tell of him but the trivial puerilities with which he has stuffed three books of the most pointless ana on record, the man to whom the commonplace Agesilaus was an hero, and who wrote the history of the rise of Thebes, </p><p>without mentioning the name of Epaminondos. The falsification of history throughout the Hellenics is not "misrepresentation." Xenophon did not know better. He really thought Agesilaus a great and good man; and did not see what there was in Epaminondos. He certainly did not intend to misrepresent Socrates. On the contrary, he is laudably zealous to vindicate his master's piety, virtue, wisdom, and patriotism, against his enemies. There was no want of goodwill here; but he had neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, him whom the oracle pronounced "wisest of men." It is easy to palliate the "Memorabilia," by saying that the soldier was no philosopher. But it is not philosophy only that is wanting, but appreciation of character. Full information, good sense, and judgment, equip a man for the practical duties of life. They do not qualify him as a political historian, where the great scale on which character and conduct exist, require a philosophic breadth of view, and largeness of sympathy, which are among the rarest of intellectual acquisitions. This want of power to distinguish the important from the trivial, is shown by Xenophon no less in fiction. The Cyropaedia" is perhaps the dullest and stupidest romance extant. The meagreness of its substance, its poverty of incident, the loquacious garrulity of its characterless personages, show much more than the absence of imagination. They prove a want of conception of the truths of life the absence of all penetration into the substance of human nature. Colonel Mure admires "the lessons of wisdom which the </p><p>Cyropasdia' inculcates.'" We rather feel that such a writer could teach us nothing; while we can never exhaust the thought which is condensed in the rich sentences of Thucvdides. </p><p>The concluding chapter of the volume on Ctesias, Theopompus, Ephorus, Philistus, and other minor historians of the Attic period, will be read with interest by the general reader. Life and character are given to the dry material, which the diligence of the antiquarians has collected about these last writers. The scholar will doubtless prefer the more condensed and exhaustive Bernhardy; the mere English reader will find all that he wishes to know on these writers in Colonel Mure's diffuse but lucid sketches.  </p><p>Mr. Finlay is combining his separate volumes already published on the Greeks, into a continuous "History of Greece under Foreign Dominion." Of this, a second edition of "Greece under the Romans" forms the first volume.2 This volume, which is complete in itself, and has a separate title, brings down the history to Lee the Isaurian, a.d. 716. Mr. Finlay goes over often-trodden ground--above all, over ground trodden by Gibbon. The conception of his plan, however, throws something of an original colouring even over the old. It is not following the decline and fall of an extinct people, but tracing backwards the fortunes of the existing Greek race; a history which shall include at one end the battle of Cynocephalae, and at the other that of Navarino, and treat the twenty centuries that intervened with a continuity not only of interest, but of theme, may claim to be original. The reign of Heraclius (610-640) may be taken as the period at which the ancient existence of the Hellenic race terminates. Their history now becomes one of sufferings and distress; the slow relapse into barbarism during the hard struggle to escape extermination at the hands of rude invaders. When the Byzantine writers find it necessary to mention the Greeks of Hellas and the Peloponnese, they do so with feelings of contempt. They are designated as Helladikoi, to distinguish them alike from the ancient Hellenes and the Romans of the Empire. The mountains of Laconia still sheltered the last relics of Greek paganism. Roads, aqueducts, bridges, and quays, everywhere fell into ruin. The plains, now uncultivated, were traversed by armed bands of Sclavonians, and society was almost wrecked. Amidst the miserable spectacle which the period offers, the mind rests with consolation on one palliating feature. The wars between the Greeks and Saracens were as yet carried on with a spirit of humanity unknown either to earlier or to succeeding times. The religious hatred which subsequently sprung up between the Christians and Mohammedans was as yet unknown. The orthodox patriarchs of Jerusalem and Alexandria submitted to the government of the Caliphs as readily as to that of the Emperors, and the Arab treatment of their heretic subjects was far from oppressive. The religious animosity which had such fatal consequences for the Christians was of later growth. The concluding pages (490-520) of the volume give an admirable summary of the condition of</p><p>2.

A really instructive history is the work of a lifetime, and not produced "in the intervals of a laborious and anxious occupation."--(Preface, p. vi.). Taking a lower measure of excellence, however, the present volume has great merits. It is clear and precise, not from second-hand sources, and bears the marks of study and reflection. It is a well-digested introductory manual of French history, and in every way well adapted for the student as a text-book. Chapter I., on "The Ancient Germans," is the worst in the book. To extract the real characteristics of the Teutonic tribes of Central Europe from the scattered notices in the classical writers, with whom rhetoric was the ever ready disguise of indolent ignorance, requires a spirit of criticism which the Author does not possess. It will be sufficient to mention that he assumes the "Germania" of Tacitus as an authentic document. The narrative part, from the first appearance of the Franks, A.D. 240, to the death of Pepin, 768, follows in 250 pages. By comparison with Thierry's brilliant and fascinating "Merits des Temps Merovingiens," Mr. Perry's narrative reads tame and uninviting. It is, however, succinct, continuous, and well arranged, and as such, well adapted to become a learner's book. The best part of the volume is the latter half, in which the political institutions, laws, customs, and state of the country and the church during the period of the narrative are discussed. The writer does not profess to offer original views, but he presents ascertained conclusions in an intelligent form. There is just sufficient discussion of grounds to excite a student's interest without distracting his attention. His summary of the treatment of the Gauls by the Franks on the first settlement (chap. viii.) may be taken as a fair specimen of this happy mixture of statement with critical reasoning. The relation of the Frank conquerors to the conquered Gallo-Norman has been a matter of much controversy. Mr. Perry exhibits the true view by the method of contrast with an erroneous one, that, viz., of referring to the fifth century a state of things known under the name of feudalism which did not exist before the eighth. The provincial coalesced in one society with the Frank, on terms not very unfavourable to the former. They retained their property, their laws, language, and religion. Not only did the constitutions of the municipal towns remain nearly intact, but the towns retained great independence of feeling and action. Indeed, when we consider the state of enervated dependence</p><p>3. "The Franks, from their first Appearance in History to the Death of King Pepin." By Walter C. Perry, Barrister-at-Law, Dr. Ph.

We find this explanation in their superior numbers, the traditions of Roman glory, settled institutions, habits of business, and their ecclesiastical organization. As long as it was a question of fighting, the Frank was the superior; but when the settlement of the conquerors began, the superiority of civilized and educated men over barbarians began to show itself. Doubtless, much was suffered in the agony of conquest; many an act of robbery, of the oppression which the weak have at all times to endure from the strong, was perpetrated afterwards; but it was done, not according to the law, but in spite of it--when the law was weak and retribution lame. But we must no more form our notions of what the legal settlement of Gaul under the conquerors was, from the acts of outrage and rapine which the Frankish annals record, than we should of the law of property and person in England from a history of the border feuds and forays. It would be most remarkable, as Mr. Perry well observes, that, had the lot of the provincial been so hard as is generally supposed, there should not be a hint of any such oppressions in the long history of Gregory of Tours, himself a Roman, and writing with Roman sympathies. </p><p>The interdiction of political action is more and more throwing the French upon their past. Research and reproduction are becoming the order of the day in France. Of the reproductions recently Brough to a conclusion, the most valuable is the new edition of "Barbier"4; the most elaborately edited is that of the "Hisoriettes de Tallemant des Reaux."5 On the last-named amusing farrago of gossip and scandal M. Paulin Paris has spent several years of his life. To his illustrations, subjoined to each "Historiette," the present edition owes the greatest part of its value. The editor has, besides, restored the orthography--that of the times of Balzac and Voiture,--that this bed-chamber chronicler may now be considered to be fully installed in a place among the "Memories" from which he had been hitherto excluded as unworthy. The journal of Barbier, which is too well known to require description, now appears with a carefully edited text under the auspices of the "French Society of History." The demand for such books is shown by the fact that this text is immediately reproduced in a cheaper reprint, "Format Charpentier." </p><p>The Journal to which the great name of "Arnauld d'Andilly" is attached, is now print- </p><p>4.

He left behind him a very voluminous diary, in which he had noted, day by day, everything that occurred within his sphere of information, which a high office about the court made a tolerable wide one. The portion now published (1614-1620) forms but a fragment of the entire journal, which was continued down to 1632, and formed 8 volumes in quarto. This, the Author's autograph, was in existence a few years ago at the Arsenal. But so careless is French surveillance of such treasures, that it has mysteriously disappeared, and all endeavours to trace it have as yet been fruitless. However, we are not to infer from this that it is finally lost. The journal of Bossuet was similarly abstracted; and after being many years missing, found its way back at last to the Bibliotheque Imperiale. </p><p>Another hitherto inedited fragment of the past are the "Letters of the Marquise de Crequy."7 The interest of these letters consists less in themselves than in their bearing on the celebrated forgery. The younger part of our readers, may require to be reminded that in 1834 a work in seven volumes octavo was published in France as the "Memoires de la Marquise de Crequy." It consisted of anecdotes true and false, but all scandalous, raked together from every source, and seasoned by being directed, wherever such a course was possible, against the Orleans family. The pretended "Memoirs" were the forgery of the certain Comte de Courchamps. It will scarcely be believed, that though the imposture was immediately unmasked, among other places by the "Quarterly Review" of the same year, the detected forgery yet went through two editions, and was received with some favour by the Parisian public;--a striking instance certainly of the indifference to historical truth habitual to the French mind. The present collection of authentic letters of the Marquise de Crequy may be considered as the last in the series of refutations called out by the forgery. The author of the "Causeries de Lundi" furnishes a biographical introduction. He exposes some of the more flagrant anachronisms of the pretended "Memoirs," and gives a rapid summary of the evidence which had been accumulated against them. He observes that the very style--the use of such words as "mystique," "erotique," "romantique," "pittoresque,"--betrays a nineteenth century pen. </p><p>The new volume of Michelet's magnificent history8 brings us down to 1628.

It is a careful, serious, and elaborate compilation, by a painstaking, and not a prejudiced man. Michelet in a generous notice of it called it "an encyclopaedia of a history of the times." It has been universally applauded by the reviews, French and English, and has received from the Academie the "grand prix Gobert," which had for so many years remained the monopoly of Augustine Thierry. It well deserved these praises. But a work of these solid merits, when placed by the side of the consummate monument designed by the genius of Michelet, sinks into insignificant proportions. Yet Michelet's history, so far from receiving the recognition due to it, as most distinctly the one capital work on their own history which the French had yet produced, has hitherto met only vague and qualified admiration. This, too, is accorded it chiefly on the ground of its picturesque descriptions and animated delineations--one, but far from its principal excellence. This indifference or injustice of opinion may be in some small degree due to this very brilliance and high-colouring of the style. General readers are apt to be prejudiced against brilliant writing, as incompatible with profound research. The dull, wooden style of M. Poirson recommended his book--stamped it as a work of labour. The artistic skill of Michelet's narrative, the dramatic pose of his tableaux, serve to disguise his labour of research. One merit, the slighter and superficial, has destroyed his credit for the others, the deep and enduring. But this common illusion--an illusion, after all, only of superficial readers--is far from being the principal cause of the cold reception of Michelet's "History of the Sixteenth Century." This cause is found in the peculiar alienation of the French national temper from the cause of liberty in Europe. The traditional policy of France, from the death of Henri VI. to the present day, has been Catholic and Absolutist. Under this system has been formed the whole national sentiment. The spurious glories of the age of Louis XIV. shed over this suicidal system a hollow splendour which concealed the rottenness within. Michelet is the first French historian who has decidedly and unhesitatingly discarded this corrupt political tradition. He does not argue, but assumes as his point of view, the anti-Catholic. He takes as his point of departure the policy of Henri IV.--not the conciliatory policy or balance of parties, but the thorough Protestant policy of the last six years, 1604-1610. Michelet is the first who has grasped all the tendencies of the contending forces in this decisive period of the history of Europe. We now see the march of affairs no longer as turning upon the mere inconstant or volatile character of the individual monarch, but as directed by a truly European policy. This policy binds up the welfare of France with that of the Protestant cause. We see Henri IV. unhesitatingly recognising this policy, but obliged to temporize, and more assiduously courting the Catholic clergy, and flattering the Jesuits, the more he threw the real weight and influence of government into the Protestant scale. We see the court and Spain, the great nobles and the Jesuits, conspire his death. The assassination of</p><p>318 History, Biography, Voyages and Travels. Oct. </p><p>Henri IV. was the triumph of the Catholic and anti-national party. We see this fatal event no longer as the random stroke of a crazy fanatic, but as the keystone of the policy of the great Conservative party. The trail of Ravaillac was hushed up; of the principal witnesses, one, Lagarde, was murdered; the other, the Demoiselle d'Escoman, was immured in the oubliettes; but, in spite of all, the truth stands clear. The plot was hatched in the Louvre; the Queen was privy; the Guises, Duc d'Epernon, Henriette d'Entragues forwarded it, and the convents found the man, and worked his mind to the required beat. With Henri IV. perished his policy. The Court of the Louvre, already in his lifetime wholly in the Spanish interest, became more and more identified with the foreign and Catholic interests. Richelieu thoroughly understood the necessity for national unity, but he arrived at it by the course so fatal to French freedom--of crushing the Protestants, i.e., the destruction of the most valuable elements of the national life. True, he did this by policy, not by violence, but the result was the same. The Protestant emigration took place. Those who stayed behind were quiet and gave no trouble to Richelieu, or to Mazarin, or to anybody else. Their moral life was extinct. The destruction of La Rochelle purchased union, but at a fearful price: it was to cut off a leg to enable the patient to walk better. The internal blow to the commerce and material prosperity of the country was great. France, with its extensive area and vast resources, continued for generations a lean and meagre starveling by the side of Holland, which, with a territory not larger than one of the thirty provinces of France, covered every sea with its tri-coloured flag. But the moral debasement of France was greater still than its material exhaustion. Under Richelieu and Mazarin that mechanical system was commenced which was enthroned under Louis XIV. The machine was brought to perfection, and the man exterminated. It was not till 1789 that moral action and political life recommenced for France.</p><p>Such is the aspect which French history offers to a foreigner. But such a view is totally opposed to that which is prevalent among Frenchmen. The historical tradition of France is Catholic and monarchical. The Revolution did not break the spell. Strange though it may seem, her historians have been Protestants (Guizot, Sismondi); her philosophers have been sceptical or indifferent, yet they have all united in adopting the politics of Richelieu and Louis XIV. To do otherwise, indeed, would seem little less than to disown France--to renounce the birthright of a Frenchman. Yet no less a sacrifice than this is demanded of one who would take a really enlarged and statesmanlike view of the course of European affairs. This eminence Michelet has been able to reach; this breadth of view he has dared to take. He is not, therefore, to look for popularity among his own countrymen. He has all parties against him. The clerical faction is furious as his exposure of the wickedness incarnate of Rome and the Jesuits. Others who have no great liking for the Church, cannot give up either the sagacity of Richelieu or the glories of the siecle. It might be thought that the Protestant body in France would be proud of such splendid support. Far from it. The Protestants of France are few in number, crushed in spirit, and much more afraid of intellect than able to appreciate it. Their sole interest is to their silly dogma. Michelet does not preach that, and they are not likely to see that this history will do more to reinstate the cause of French Protestantism in the opinion of Europe than any book which has appeared since Calvin's "Institutes." This masterly view of the policy and interests of France is the capital merit of Michelet's history. The secondary merits, of style, composition, and colouring, would alone be sufficient to make the fortune of any less known writer. The ordinary historian sacrifices to the decorums of his craft at least one half of the springs of human action. The part played by women--an influence on public life especially great in French affairs,--is the one which they are apt to slur over, to avoid the difficulties inherent in the subject. For example, M. Poirson has one line on Gabrielle d'Estrees, an omission convenient to the writer, but which falsifies his whole representation of several important years of French history. Michelet will not sacrifice truth to this conventional fastidiousness. Another important novelty is his assigning its due weight as a force to what may be called the "whim of the age." The side lights that he throws on such subjects differ from ordinary historians in this, that while they represent them as singular and isolated phenomena, or illustrations of mere manners, Michelet brings them out in their bearing on the national temper and general politics. The three prominent moral facts of the epoch (reign of Henri IV.) are Sorcery, the Convents, Casuistry. In the country which the Jesuits had to successfully vindicated for the Catholic religion, arose a worship of the Devil. Under their ecclesiastical reign of terror, the trembling population, abandoned, it seemed, by the God of the Church, found or invented for itself a new and horrible deity. Driven by terror to the Church by day, it indemnified itself by the Witches' Sabbath, and the Black Mass by night. In their short hour of liberty, the poor people mocked their tyrants, mocked their own misery. "The Sorcerer's Sabbath" was a rude farce in four or five acts, in which the tyrant Church and Feudal empire furnished the subject of the hideous jest. In the seventeenth century, if the entertainment had become less savage, its immorality had become more refined. The influence of the convents on the life of the times is not to be measured by their numbers. Yet, even the numbers of those powerful machines of intrigue is an important historical fact. It was in the century between 1620-1720 that the great development of convent life in France took place. The Ursulines, e.g., had about a thousand houses devoted to education. One branch only of the "Ladies of the Visitation," that of Sacre Coeur, founded in twenty years more than four hundred houses. This great system of establishments formed in the hands of the Jesuits an enormous organ on which their skilful hands would play whenever it was necessary to elicit great displays of public opinion. The influence of the press!--what is it compared to the tender, winning eloquence of so many religious ladies on the women, not to say the men, who frequented their par-</p><p>1857. History, Biography, Voyages and Travels. 319 </p><p>lours? These visitants, mothers of their pupils, or relations of their own, received from the mouths of The Sisters the word of command, which had originally issued from the Louvre, from Pere Cotton, or from Pere Arnoux. This order, falling, like a spark in powder, upon the inflammable material of tender and docile hearts, spread through the length and breadth of the land with inconceivable rapidity. This volume contains pieces of description which match those in previous volumes of the "S. Bartholomew," and the "Murder of the Duke of Guise." The "Siege of La Rochelle" is a masterpiece of this sort. But we do not know that Michelet has ever drawn with greater effect over the sources of pity and terror, than in his narrative (pp. 31-49) of the death of Gabrielle. </p><p>We have a specimen of the literature of "The Empire" in M. Laurent de l'Ardeche's "Refutation of the Memoirs of the Duke of Ragusa."9 It is published by the publisher of the "OEuvres de l'Empereur Napoleon III.," and it breathes the spirit of baseness and moral insensibility which animates the splendid exterior of the Second Empire. It is a pamphlet of upwards of 400 tedious pages, a la Gortschakoff, evidently written to order, and paid for. The pamphleteer performs his dirty duty thoroughly. He follows the "Memoirs" step by step, and denies with praiseworthy pertinacity every statement in them which does not redound to the honour and glory of Napoleon I. It is, indeed, an article in the Monitor, in extended proportions. The "Memoirs of Marshal Marmont" are before the world, and though no one would undertake to guarantee to the letter the correctness of all their statements, yet public opinion has justly recognized the general integrity and truthfulness of the soldier's recollections. In a free country, to attempt to shake the credit of a work so genuine as that of the Marshal's by an ill-written partisan pamphlet, would be impossible. It is not so in France at present. The tampering of Power with the Press not only vitiates the truth of fact, but hopelessly perverts the sensibility to truth, at the best not very strong in the uneducated mind. We know not whether it may be worth remarking, as a sign of Napoleonic opinion, that the pamphleteer shows a disposition to patronize the Restoration. He is angry with Marshal Marmont for having said of this period, that in it "tout etait petit, et petit jusqu'a la degradation." Impudently enough he cites as exceptions, among other names, those of Royer-Collard, Guizot, and Villemain. How did the Restoration treat these men? Just as the Empire treats intellect and genius now. </p><p>Mr. Bohn having become the proprietor of Mr. Jesse's copyright, issues a new edition of "The Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of the Stuarts,"10 with portrait illustrations, and in a clear and readable type.

In this edition "considerable additions have been made, and a better arrangement of the materials attempted. Indeed, so many new facts, illustrative of Pope's literacy and personal character, have been brought to light within the last four or five years, that any previous life of the poet would require to be almost wholly re-written. The editor has availed himself of this recent information--of course specifying the authority for each fact and illustration--and he has been enabled to make some additions from unpublished sources. Further extracts are given from the Mapledurham MSS., including a few letters from Pope, Mrs. Howard, Mallet, &amp;c." (Preface, p. 1.) The peculiar difficulty of Pope's biography lies in the mass of anonymous literary squabbling which hands like a mist around his name. The anonymous and pseudonymous was partly the habit of the times, and partly created by his own tricky disposition:-- </p><p>"Pope, with manly wisdom, despised the pioe fraudes of his Church. He tolerated no juggling in concerns of eternal moment. But unfortunately he did not carry this spirit into literature. His poeticoe fraudes are numerous and undeniable. Some are serious, intended to avert the consequences of his satire; some are prompted by vanity; and some can be assigned to no other cause than a delight in stratagem. To equivocate genteelly, as he termed it, or to deny firmly, as circumstances might require, were expedients he never hesitated to adopt. The ardour of his composition, it is probably, at times carried him farther than he intended, and led him to over-colour his pictures, so that he might safely deny part. 'It must be owned,' said Lord Chesterfield, "that Pope was the most irritable of all the genus irritabile vatum--offended with trifles, and never forgetting or forgiving them.' Still he shrank from the responsibility of his attacks, and the contests between his irresistible proneness to satire and his want of moral courage, or his reluctance to continue injustice, involved him in pitiable and humiliating situations, which, without the can't of sensibility, all must deplore if not condemn. These results became more conspicuous when his epistles led him to deal with higher characters than most of those in the 'Dunciad.'"--(Carruthers, p. 290.) </p><p>The tricks, subterfuges, artifices, and false pretenses, by which he disguised his assaults, or baffled those of his foes, contribute a labyrinth of literary imposture of the most petty kind, through which a biographer is under the necessity of wading. In such labours Mr. Carruthers has many rivals, but is hardly likely to find a superior. We cannot pretend much sympathy with this style of research. As biographies swell almost to bursting with minute details, under the process of accumulation, it is easy to foresee that we shall have to revert again to that abridged style of biography, of which Johnson's "Lives of the Poets" are models;--a style which gives us conclusions, but spares us the premises; a style in which the biographer's industry appears in the completeness of the charac- </p><p>11.

Victor Schoelcher12 has beguiled the sad hours of exile in the compilation of a very complete Life of Handel. The Author has been unfortunate in his translator, whose English has neither grace nor correctness. But perhaps this is not of much moment, as the book is intended chiefly for the musical world. M. Schoelcher has spared neither time not pains in a long, laborious and expensive search after every source, period or written, from which information could be obtained. There has been no Life of Handel since Mainwaring's in 1760; and it "is nothing but a summary, without much exactness." The present therefore may be said to be the first at all adequate biography of the great Saxon composer. The research shown in it would be worthy of the highest praise in a native; in a foreigner it is astonishing. The value of it as a piece of musical history must be left to the judgement of professed musicians. As a picture of the man, it labours under the defect of a panegyrical tone. There is, however, not much room for mistake about the leading features of Handel's character. They are simple, strongly marked, and lie on the surface. Indeed, many of the anecdotes about him are among our standard jokes. He was a strong-made portly person, of impetuous temper, and great sensitiveness. The art of composing excited him to tears. A friend, calling upon him when in the act of setting the words, "He was despised and rejected of men," found him absolutely sobbing. He was imperious, irritable, and swore vehemently; but as ardent in his religion as he was in everything else he did. For several days before his death, he expressed a wish that he might breathe his last on Good Friday--"In hopes," he said, "of meeting his sweet Lord and Saviour on the day of his resurrection." With a strong disposition for merriment, he was proud and reserved. He had all the jealousy and impatience of rivalry habitual to artists. One honorable trait should never be omitted in speaking of him--his spirit of independence. The insolent and vulgar hauteur of the English aristocracy he repelled with the conscious pride of of self-reliance. This too, was at a time when the divine Mozart could be sent by the Archbishop of Salzburg to eat with the servants, and when Haydn permitted an Hungarian magnate to say to him, "Go and dress yourself like a chapel-master." Handel's industry was as great as his genius; and he retained his vigour and power of working till an advanced age.

Indeed, its best parts are already, at the moment we are writing, known to us through the "weeklies," which have all felt the attraction. The ideas, as well as the idiom of the Orientals in general, are so remote from ours, that it affords us neither pleasure nor amusement to follow them. But Lutfullah, though a Mahommedan, having learnt English thoroughly, and mixed much with the English, talks and thinks as Europeans do, yet with a continual reservation of the native Indian point of view. It is the mixture of simplicity and shrewdness, of the child's curiosity with the man's astuteness, that constitutes the charm of the book. It reminds us of the "Citizen of the World," in which the same union of dissimilar qualities is admirably hit off by Goldsmith. Besides the amusement it affords, those who have not been in India may catch glimpses o the real state of society in India. We are flooded, just now more than ever, with English descriptions of society, i.e. the dinners and balls of the Anglo-Indian residents. From these works on India we learn nothing about the natives, with whom, except as servants or tradesmen, our countrymen never come in contact; for missionary accounts are couched in a falsetto tone of theological slang, which removes them into a world of their own. In Lutfullah's Life we see--and all the better as he does not write with that object--something of the true native character, and of its relations to the true conquering people. If any one is disposed to think that the English are beginning to be regarded otherwise than as aliens by the natives of Hindostan, let him be undeceived. Nor can we gather from this book that either the mental discipline, or the moral ideas, or the religion of the English, have made any serious impression on the native races. Lutfullah is known as one of the least bigoted of all the disciples of Islam: yet his antipathy to all that we call Progress is most manifest. He is a man of clear perceptions, good feeling, and generous dispositions: yet he relates of himself, or of others, meanness, servility, and indirectness which an Englishman, even if he would practice, would not tell. They have no notion of justice, integrity, and honour, among themselves, and they have not acquired these notions from us. The conduct of government, as of private persons, is an alternation of treachery and violence; and treachery and violence are the only instruments of government that they respect. Our faults against Hindostan are great; yet it may be a question whether an exhibition of all the virtues in the moral code would have produced any devastating effect upon races whose moral perceptions seem blighted by ages of slavery and superstition. Lutfullah's ideas on women remain thoroughly Moslem. He attributes the prostitution of London to "the licence established by the civilizers:"--</p><p>"The English leave their women to remain uncontrolled in life, and permit them to enjoy the </p><p>creatures: interspersed with Remarks on the Habits, Customs, and Character of the People with whom he had to deal."

Naturally weak, how many of them fall victims to the brutal intrigues of men; how many families of high name have been ruined by this unreasonable licence! Ido not say that all Modammedan ladies are virtuous. Virtue and vice are two sisters--are former fair and the latter black: and no nation has ever been, and shall ever be, uninfluenced by the two ladies. But limits and restraints prescribed by the Mohammedan law and usage in domestic affairs, I am bound to say, at all events prevent increase in vice and decrease in virtue. The time of the Mohammedan ladies being occupied in needlework, in the performance of their religious duties five time a day, in looking over their kitchens, and other household affairs, they have no leisure to think of admirers. Their marriages are arranged by their parents, who are their best friends, and those experience in worldly affairs must be greater than theirs. Opportunities are in general afforded to the bride to see her would-be husband from a loop-hole or a window before she is married to him; and no matrimonial contract is considered binding, unless the lawfully attested consent of both parties is first obtained, and taken down in writing by the law officer appointed by the Government to solemnize the marriage. Thus many bitter feuds and lasting animosities which poison the minds of contending rivals are avoided, and marriage beds are not only free from contamination, but from the dread of it. In short, seclusion secures women from those delusions and temptations which irritate the mind with fleeting joys, leaving behind the permanent sting of bitter remorse; while, never having tested, the universal triumph and dominion which beauty gives in the circle of Europe, the pang of lost power is not added to the painful sensation of fading charms." </p><p>Travels, even the best, cannot teach readers the real character and sentiment of a people. They familiarize us with the exterior forms of nature and art, and the superficial customs and observances. This sort of information is curious and interesting; nay, more, it is material for the inferences of a higher knowledge. The existing usages and institutions of a nation conduct to conclusions as to its past history. But it is to more invisible and imponderable agencies of prevailing opinion that we must look for such data as alone will enable us to understand and deal with the present, or forecast the future. This is why we look anxiously for any explanations or elucidations of the religious sentiment (if religious it may be) which is at the bottom of the insurrection in China. In the rebellion is embodied the only moral movement or agitation of social life that has stirred China for centuries. That some such principle animates it,--that it is not the mere lawless outbreak of gangs of land pirates,--is clear. But what the moving influence is, is yet, after the lapse of several years since its confinement, still undetermined. We do not find any light on this interesting point in Mr. Fortune's new volume of Chinese Travels.14 He seems to agree in what</p><p>14.

London: J. Murray. 1857. </p><p>we believe is now the general opinion, that the movement is not in any sense Christian. This is a subject, however, for which Mr. Fortune has no eyes. On his own subject--the cultivation of the tea-plant, and the manufacture of silk and tea--the present volume contains much useful information. Instead of traveling, as before in the disguise of a native, he travelled in his proper character of "outside barbarian," and found this the better plan. Information was freely given. There seemed neither mystery nor secrecy about the various processes. He brought away with him many new plants and a number of skilled manufacturers from the tea-districts of the interior. With respect to our unfortunate position towards the Chinese in the present war, Mr. Fortune's remarks are short and judicious. He points out our great mistake in not enforcing from the first treaty in 1842, and the way in which we allowed ourselves to be outreached by the artful diplomacy of a people whose power we despised. Nor were we only outwitted by the Imperial Commissioner, but degraded in the estimated of the Chinese by making a demand which we dared not enforce: for fear is the only motive to which, in their comprehension, our moderation can be ascribed. </p><p>Much more full of information than Mr. Fortune's volume is Mr. Russell's "North America."15 It abounds with carefully collected observations on farming in Canada and the States, made by one who is at once a practical farmer and a man of science. This combination of qualities makes Mr. Russell's book most valuable as a report on American methods. The scientific chemists in this country have been, till recently, far too prone to dogmatize to the farmer. They are beginning to understand, that analysis of soils must be taken in combination with climate, before we can apply it to practice. Much more extended observations are therefore necessary before a sufficient basis for Agricultural Chemistry will be obtained. Mr. Russell has repeatedly to notice how much climate alters our ideas of the character of soil best suited to certain crops. Climate, rather than soil, determines the distinction of Prairie and Forest. The same soil, which in Michigan produces only stunted bush, will on the Atlantic sea-board, where rain is abundant, produce dense forests of timber. A line drawn north and south, from the centre of Michigan to St. Louis, and extending to Texas, would form a rough boundary between the wooded and the treeless country. West of this line, the trees are generally stunted, unless along the margins of the rivers: whereas the country eastward to the Atlantic was almost everywhere densely clothed with timber when first discovered by Europeans. Those who like to read of hustings politics, of Buchanan's Kansas policy, and Fremont's chances, will not find anything to suit them in Mr. Russell's book. But those who wish for informa- </p><p>15.

This has been Mr. Alexander Smith's good or evil fortune. Tennyson slowly ascended to his zenith; the two Brownings were long in winning a fair acknowledgment; Matthew Arnold is still all but unknown, notwithstanding his noble poetic faculty: Mr. Alexander Smith shares with the author of "Festus" the application of the Byronic phrase we have quoted. We trust that he is not, in imitation of his rival, going to treat us to a series of disappointments, and make such a production as the "Life Drama" the basis of a fame for which, to those who read it when the promise it contained has been belied, it will scarcely seem the apology. The "Life Drama" was remarkable as the work of a very young man in a season of poetic dearth. It was built on a story of Keats and Tennyson, and affinity with those poets. Its blank-verse, monotonous in the end, was exquisitely sweet, and showed ease and feeling, as well as careful reading of the masters of that metre. The poem abounded in fine isolated lines, in charming conceits, thrown sensibly out as such, and everywhere, in spite of occasional spasmodism, it was evident that the Author's brain was not dazzled by his own exhibition of fireworks, but had at bottom an active common sense that would ultimately hold him from the excesses of the school whose faith he professed, and was even then vigilant to avert obscurity and many of those vain irregularities which characterize "Festus" and "Balder." The sonnets at the close of the volume we remember as a further instance of his possession of the faculty of verse, and of the promise of higher perfection. Having said thus much, the critic, </p><p>"Running a mile that he might leap a yard," </p><p>as Mr. Smith finely writes, must admit that he is disappointed in the "City Poems."1 They are not up to the mark. The style of the poems, the very cadences of the verse, recall the "Life Drama." Moreover, Mr. Smith has not got a whit nearer to real life. He is still wandering outside the busy circle, making a poem of it not from it. </p><p>Four years have elapsed since the publication of the "Life Drama." We have a right to expect something different, and much better, after such an interval. Powers so precocious should be neighbouring maturity by this time. Mr. Smith talks and talks: he is more and more Alexander Smith, and proportionately less the </p><p>1. "City Poems." By Alexander Smith. Cambridge: Macmillan and Co. 1857 </p><p>poet we hoped he would be. That he is a true poet many passages in this volume sufficiently prove; but he is not creative, and we cannot say that he is even original. The spirit and tone of Tennyson are reproduced in the "City Poems;" it is impossible to forget the Laureate while we read them. His characters are the merest abstractions--pegs for the hanging of poetic bravery on; and so long-winded are the reflective parts, the digressions so random, that all story is lost in them. Horton is an ill-fated genius, who-- </p><p>"Plunged from off this crumbling shoal of Time, </p><p>Struck for the coast of Fame--with stiffened limbs </p><p>Went down in sight of land." </p><p>He flies before the reader like a gossamer in a mist, and in fact he is just such a filmy substance. A set of young men, discussing his history, strike out here and there some clever images, with a fling at the critics by the way. We are to presume, doubtless, that Charles, James, Max, John, and Harry, are a group of spasmodic poets disguised under Christian-names. At least their hostility to our class, contempt for cotton, and general preference of soliloquy to dialogue, may warrant the supposition. For the rest, they speak more sensibly than the race usually does. Thus picturing Horton's eyes,--</p><p>"The thought stood in them ere 'twas spoken; </p><p>Wit </p><p>Laughed on you from the windows ere she danced </p><p>Out on you from the door." </p><p>Again-- </p><p>"--for Fame's consummate fruit, which ne'er </p><p>Has cool'd the fever of a living lip, </p><p>Which ripens slowly through laborious years, </p><p>Then, heavy with its sweetness and its bloom, </p><p>Falls on a grave, he could not wait; so pluck'd </p><p>Crude Reputation's green and bastard crab, </p><p>Which set his teeth on edge. This error soured </p><p>His native goodness." </p><p>The fatal incident in Horton's life appears to have been his love for a "lily-woman," who is lost to him by drowning; but Horton with all his sorrows and the good things he gives occasion to be said of him, is light-weighted, and flits out of sight and mind before we have finished the poem. </p><p>"Squire Maurice" is better conceived, and holds a really tragic position. It is a poem of Love and Irresolution. He is plighted to a girl of low degree, but cannot summon courage to break with the world and follow the impulse of his heart.

Let us, then, for a moment imagine ourselves, as students of this natural history, “dredging” the first half of the eighteenth century in search of specimens. About the year 1730 we have hauled up a remarkable individual of the species divine—a surprising name, considering the nature of the animal before us, but we are used to unsuitable names in natural history. Let us examine this individual at our leisure. He is on the verge of fifty, and has recently undergone his metamorphosis into the clerical form. Rather a paradoxical specimen, if you observe him narrowly: a sort of cross between a sycophant and a psalmist; a poet whose imagination is alternately fired by the “Last Day” and by a creation of peers, who fluctuates between rhapsodic applause of King George and rhapsodic applause of Jehovah. After spending “a foolish youth, the sport of peers and poets,” after being a hanger-on of the profligate Duke of Wharton, after aiming in vain at a parliamentary </p><p>career, and angling for pensions and preferment with fulsome dedications and fustian odes, he is a little disgusted with his imperfect success, and has determined to retire from the general mendicancy business to a particular branch; in other words, he has determined on that renunciation of the world implied in “taking orders,” with the prospect of a good living and an advantageous matrimonial connection. And no man can be better fitted for an Established Church. He personifies completely her nice balance of temporalities and spiritualities. He is equally impressed with the momentousness of death and of burial fees; he languishes at once for immortal life and for “livings;” he has a fervid attachment to patrons in general, but on the whole prefers the Almighty. He will teach, with something more than official conviction, the nothingness of earthly things; and he will feel something more than private disgust if his meritorious efforts in directing men’s attention to another world are not rewarded by substantial preferment in this. His secular man believes in cambric bands and silk stockings as characteristic attire for “an ornament of religion and virtue;” hopes courtiers will never forget to copy Sir Robert Walpole; and writes begging letters to the King’s mistress. His spiritual man recognizes no motives more familiar than Golgotha and “the skies;” it walks in graveyards, or it soars among the stars. His religion exhausts itself in ejaculations and rebukes, and knows no medium between the ecstatic and the sententious. If it were not for the prospect of immortality, he considers, it would be wise and agreeable to be indecent or to murder one’s father; and, heaven apart, it would be extremely irrational in any man not to be a knave. Man, he thinks, is a compound of the angel and the brute; the brute is to be humbled by being reminded of its “relation to the stalls,” and frightened into moderation by the contemplation of death-beds and skulls; the angel is to be developed by vituperating this world and exalting the next; and by this double process you get the Christian—“the highest style of man.” With all this, our new-made divine is an unmistakable poet. To a clay compounded chiefly of the worldling and the rhetorician, there is added a real spark of Promethean fire. He will one day clothe his apostrophes and objurgations, his astronomical religion and his charnel-house morality, in lasting verse, which will stand, like a Juggernaut made of gold and jewels, at once magnificent and repulsive: for this divine is Edward Young, the future author of the “Night Thoughts.”</p><p>It would be extremely ill-bred in us to suppose that our readers are not acquainted with the facts of Young’s life; they are among the things that “every one knows;” but we have observed that, with regard to these universally known matters, the majority of readers like to be treated after the plan suggested by Monsieur Jourdain. When that distinguished bourgeois was asked if he knew Latin, he implied, “Oui, mais faîtes comme si je ne le savais pas.” Assuming, then, as a polite writer should, that our readers know everything about Young, it will be a direct </p><p>sequitur from that assumption that we should proceed as if they knew nothing, and recall the incidents of his biography with as much particularity as we may without trenching on the space we shall need for our main purpose—the reconsideration of his character as a moral and religious poet. </p><p>Judging from Young’s works, one might imagine that the preacher had been organized in him by hereditary transmission through a long line of clerical forefathers—that the diamonds of the “Night Thoughts” had been slowly condensed from the charcoal of ancestral sermons. Yet it was not so. His grandfather, apparently, wrote himself gentleman, not clerk; and there is no evidence that preaching had run in the family blood before it took that turn in the person of the poet’s father, who was quadruply clerical, being at once rector, prebendary, court chaplain, and dean. Young was born at his father’s rectory of Upham in 1681. We may confidently assume that even the author of the “Night Thoughts” came into the world without a wig; but, apart from Dr. Doran’s authority, we should not have ventured to state that the excellent rector “kissed, with dignified emotion, his only son and intended namesake.” Dr. Doran doubtless knows this, from his intimate acquaintance with clerical physiology and psychology. He has ascertained that the paternal emotions of prebendaries have a sacerdotal quality, and that the very chyme and chyle of a rector are conscious of the gown and band.</p><p>In due time the boy went to Winchester College, and subsequently, though not till he was twenty-two, to Oxford, where, for his father’s sake, he was befriended by the wardens of two colleges, and in 1708, three years after his father’s death, nominated by Archbishop Tenison to a law fellowship at All Souls. Of Young’s life at Oxford in these years, hardly anything is known. His biographer, Croft, has nothing to tell us but the vague report that, when “Young found himself independent and his own master at All Souls, he was not the ornament to religion and morality that he afterward became,” and the perhaps apocryphal anecdote, that Tindal, the atheist, confessed himself embarrassed by the originality of Young’s arguments. Both the report and the anecdote, however, are borne out by indirect evidence. As to the latter, Young has left us sufficient proof that he was fond of arguing on the theological side, and that he had his own way of treating old subjects. As to the former, we learn that Pope, after saying other things which we know to be true of Young, added, that he passed “a foolish youth, the sport of peers and poets;” and, from all the indications we possess of his career till he was nearly fifty, we are inclined to think that Pope’s statement only errs by defect, and that he should rather have said, “a foolish youth and middle age.” It is not likely that Young was a very hard student, for he impressed Johnson, who saw him in his old age, as “not a great scholar,” and as surprisingly ignorant of what Johnson thought “quite common maxims” in literature; and there is no evidence that he filled either his leisure or his purse by taking pupils. His career as an author did not commence till he was nearly thirty, even dating from the publication of a portion of the “Last Day,” in the Tatler; so that he could hardly have been absorbed in composition. But where the fully developed insect is parasitic, we believe the larva is usually parasitic also, and we shall probably not be far wrong in supposing that Young at Oxford, as elsewhere, spent a good deal of his time in hanging about possible and actual patrons, and accommodating himself to the habits with considerable flexibility of conscience and of tongue; being none the less ready, upon occasion, to present himself as the champion of theology and to rhapsodize at convenient moments in the company of the skies or of skulls. That brilliant profligate, the Duke of Wharton, to whom Young afterward clung as his chief patron, was at this time a mere boy; and, though it is probable that their intimacy had commenced, since the Duke’s father and mother were friends of the old dean, that intimacy ought not to aggravate any unfavorable inference as to Young’s Oxford life. It is less likely that he fell into any exceptional vice than that he differed from the men around him chiefly in his episodes of theological advocacy and rhapsodic solemnity. He probably sowed his wild oats after the coarse fashion of his times, for he has left us sufficient evidence that his moral sense was not delicate; but his companions, who were occupied in sowing their own oats, perhaps took it as a matter of course that he should be a rake, and were only struck with the exceptional circumstance that he was a pious and moralizing rake. </p><p>There is some irony in the fact that the two first poetical productions of Young, published in the same year, were his “Epistles to Lord Lansdowne,” celebrating the recent creation of peers—Lord Lansdowne’s creation in particular; and the “Last Day.” Other poets besides Young found the device for obtaining a Tory majority by turning twelve insignificant commoners into insignificant lords, an irresistible stimulus to verse; but no other poet showed so versatile an enthusiasm—so nearly equal an ardor for the honor of the new baron and the honor of the Deity. But the twofold nature of the sycophant and the psalmist is not more strikingly shown in the contrasted themes of the two poems than in the transitions from bombast about monarchs to bombast about the resurrection, in the “Last Day” itself. The dedication of the poem to Queen Anne, Young afterward suppressed, for he was always ashamed of having flattered a dead patron. In this dedication, Croft tells us, “he gives her Majesty praise indeed for her victories, but says that the author is more pleased to see her rise from this lower world, soaring above the clouds, passing the first and second heavens, and leaving the fixed stars behind her; nor will he lose her there, he says, but keep her still in view through the boundless spaces on the other side of creation, in her journey toward eternal bliss, till he behold the heaven of heavens open, and angels receiving and conveying her still onward from the stretch of his imagination, which tires in her pursuit, and falls back again to earth.”</p><p>The self-criticism which prompted the suppression of the dedication did not, however, lead him to improve either the rhyme or the reason of the unfortunate couplet— </p><p>“When other Bourbons reign in other lands, </p><p>And, if men’s sins forbid not, other Annes.” </p><p>In the “Epistle to Lord Lansdowne” Young indicates his taste for the drama; and there is evidence that his tragedy of “Busiris” was “in the theatre” as early as this very year, 1713, though it was not brought on the stage till nearly six years later; so that Young was now very decidedly bent on authorship, for which his degree of B.C.L., taken in this year, was doubtless a magical equipment. Another poem, “The Force of Religion; or, Vanquished Love,” founded on the execution of Lady Jane Grey and her husband, quickly followed, showing fertility in feeble and tasteless verse; and on the Queen’s death, in 1714, Young lost no time in making a poetical lament for a departed patron a vehicle for extravagant laudation of the new monarch. No further literary production of his appeared until 1716, when a Latin oration, which he delivered on the foundation of the Codrington Library at All Souls, gave him a new opportunity for displaying his alacrity in inflated panegyric. </p><p>In 1717 it is probable that Young accompanied the Duke of Wharton to Ireland, though so slender are the materials for his biography that the chief basis for this supposition is a passage in his “Conjectures on Original Composition,” written when he was nearly eighty, in which he intimates that he had once been in that country. But there are many facts surviving to indicate that for the next eight or nine years Young was a sort of attaché of Wharton’s. In 1719, according to legal records, the Duke granted him an annuity, in consideration of his having relinquished the office of tutor to Lord Burleigh, with a life annuity of £100 a year, on his Grace’s assurances that he would provide for him in a much more ample manner. And again, from the same evidence, it appears that in 1721 Young received from Wharton a bond for £600, in compensation of expenses incurred in standing for Parliament at the Duke’s desire, and as an earnest of greater services which his Grace had promised him on his refraining from the spiritual and temporal advantages of taking orders, with a certainty of two livings in the gift of his college. It is clear, therefore, that lay advancement, as long as there was any chance of it, had more attractions for Young than clerical preferment; and that at this time he accepted the Duke of Wharton as the pilot of his career. </p><p>A more creditable relation of Young’s was his friendship with Tickell, with whom he was in the habit of interchanging criticisms, and to whom in 1719—the same year, let us note, in which he took his doctor’s degree—he addressed his “Lines on the Death of Addison.” Close upon these followed his “Paraphrase of part of the Book of Job,” with a dedication to Parker, recently made Lord Chancellor, showing that the possession of Wharton’s patronage did not prevent Young from fishing in other waters. He knew nothing of Parker, but that did not prevent him from magnifying the new Chancellor’s merits; on the other hand, he did know Wharton, but this again did not prevent him from prefixing to his tragedy, “The Revenge,” which appeared in 1721, a dedication attributing to the Duke all virtues, as well as all accomplishments. In the concluding sentence of this dedication, Young naïvely indicates that a considerable ingredient in his</p><p>gratitude was a lively sense of anticipated favors. “My present fortune is his bounty, and my future his care; which I will venture to say will always be remembered to his honor; since he, I know, intended his generosity as an encouragement to merit, through his very pardonable partiality to one who bears him so sincere a duty and respect, I happen to receive the benefit of it.” Young was economical with his ideas and images; he was rarely satisfied with using a clever thing once, and this bit of ingenious humility was afterward made to do duty in the “Instalment,” a poem addressed to Walpole: </p><p>“Be this thy partial smile, from censure free, </p><p>’Twas meant for merit, though it fell on me.” </p><p>It was probably “The Revenge” that Young was writing when, as we learn from Spence’s anecdotes, the Duke of Wharton gave him a skull with a candle fixed in it, as the most appropriate lamp by which to write tragedy. According to Young’s dedication, the Duke was “accessory” to the scenes of this tragedy in a more important way, “not only by suggesting the most beautiful incident in them, but by making all possible provision for the success of the whole.” A statement which is credible, not indeed on the ground of Young’s dedicatory assertion, but from the known ability of the Duke, who, as Pope tells us, possessed </p><p>“each gift of Nature and of Art, </p><p>And wanted nothing but an honest heart.” </p><p>The year 1722 seems to have been the period of a visit to Mr. Dodington, of Eastbury, in Dorsetshire—the “pure Dorsetian downs” celebrated by Thomson—in which Young made the acquaintance of Voltaire; for in the subsequent dedication of his “Sea Piece” to “Mr. Voltaire,” he recalls their meeting on “Dorset Downs;” and it was in this year that Christopher Pitt, a gentleman-poet of those days, addressed an “Epistle to Dr. Edward Young, at Eastbury, in Dorsetshire,” which has at least the merit of this biographical couplet: </p><p>“While with your Dodington retired you sit, </p><p>Charm’d with his flowing Burgundy and wit.” </p><p>Dodington, apparently, was charmed in his turn, for he told Dr. Wharton that Young was “far superior to the French poet in the variety and novelty of his bon-mots and repartees. Unfortunately, the only specimen of Young’s wit on this occasion that has been preserved to us is the epigram represented as an extempore retort (spoken aside, surely) to Voltaire’s criticism of Milton’s episode of sin and death: </p><p>“Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin, </p><p>At once, we think thee Milton, Death, and Sin;”— </p><p>an epigram which, in the absence of “flowing Burgundy,” does not strike us as remarkably brilliant. Let us give Young the benefit of the doubt thrown on the genuineness of this epigram by his own poetical dedication, in which he represents himself as having “soothed” Voltaire’s “rage” against Milton “with gentle rhymes;” though in other respects that dedication is anything but favorable to a high estimate of Young’s wit. Other evidence apart, we should not be eager for the after-dinner conversation of the man who wrote: </p><p>“Thine is the Drama, how renown’d! </p><p>Thine Epic’s loftier trump to sound;— </p><p>But let Arion’s sea-strung harp be mine; </p><p>But where’s his dolphin? Know’st thou where? </p><p>May that be found in thee, Voltaire!”</p><p>The “Satires” appeared in 1725 and 1726, each, of course, with its laudatory dedication and its compliments insinuated among the rhymes. The seventh and last is dedicated to Sir Robert Walpole, is very short, and contains nothing in particular except lunatic flattery of George the First and his prime minister, attributing that royal hog’s late escape from a storm at sea to the miraculous influence of his grand and virtuous soul—for George, he says, rivals the angels: </p><p>“George, who in foes can soft affections raise, </p><p>And charm envenom’d satire into praise. </p><p>Nor human rage alone his pow’r perceives, </p><p>But the mad winds and the tumultuous waves, </p><p>Ev’n storms (Death’s fiercest ministers!) forbear, </p><p>And in their own wild empire learn to spare. </p><p>Thus, Nature’s self, supporting Man’s decree, </p><p>Styles Britain’s sovereign, sovereign of the sea.” </p><p>As for Walpole, what he felt at this tremendous crisis </p><p>“No powers of language, but his own, can tell, </p><p>His own, which Nature and the Graces form, </p><p>At will, to raise, or hush, the civil storm.” </p><p>It is a coincidence worth noticing, that this seventh Satire was published in 1726, and that the warrant of George the First, granting Young a pension of £200 a year from Lady-day, 1725, is dated May 3rd, 1726. The gratitude exhibited in this Satire may have been chiefly prospective, but the “Instalment,” a poem inspired by the thrilling event of Walpole’s installation as Knight of the Garter, was clearly written with the double ardor of a man who has got a pension and hopes for something more. His emotion about Walpole is precisely at the same pitch as his subsequent emotion about the Second Advent. In the “Instalment” he says: </p><p>“With invocations some their hearts inflame; </p><p>I need no muse, a Walpole is my theme.” </p><p>And of God coming to judgment, he says, in the “Night Thoughts:” </p><p>“I find my inspiration is my theme; </p><p>The grandeur of my subject is my muse.” </p><p>Nothing can be feebler than this “Instalment,” except in the strength of impudence with which the writer professes to scorn the prostitution of fair fame, the “profanation of celestial fire.” </p><p>Herbert Croft tells us that Young made more than three thousand pounds by his “Satires”—a surprising statement, taken in connection with the reasonable doubt he throws on the story related in Spence’s “Anecdotes,” that the Duke of Wharton gave Young £2000 for this work. Young, however, seems to have been tolerably fortunate in the pecuniary results of his publications; and, with his literary profits, his annuity from Wharton, his fellowship, and his pension, not to mention other bounties which may be inferred from the high merits he discovers in many men of wealth and position, we may fairly suppose that he now laid the foundation of the considerable fortune he left at his death. </p><p>It is probable that the Duke of Wharton’s final departure for the Continent and disgrace at Court in 1726, and the consequent cessation of Young’s reliance on his patronage, tended not only to heighten the temperature of his poetical enthusiasm for Sir Robert Walpole, but also to turn his thoughts toward the Church again, as the second-best means of rising in the world. On the accession of George the Second, Young found the same transcendent merits in him as in his predecessor, and celebrated them in a style of poetry previously unattempted by him—the Pindaric ode, a poetic form which helped him to surpass himself in furious bombast. “Ocean, an Ode: concluding with a Wish,” was the title of this piece. He afterward pruned it, and cut off, among other things, the concluding Wish, expressing the yearning for humble retirement, which, of course, had prompted him to the effusion; but we may judge of the rejected stanzas by the quality of those he has allowed to remain. For example, calling on Britain’s dead mariners to rise and meet their “country’s full-blown glory” in the person of the new King, he says:</p><p>“What powerful charm </p><p>Can Death disarm? </p><p>Your long, your iron slumbers break? </p><p>By Jove, by Fame, </p><p>By George’s name, </p><p>Awake! awake! awake! awake!” </p><p>Soon after this notable production, which was written with the ripe folly of forty-seven, Young took orders, and was presently appointed chaplain to the King. “The Brothers,” his third and last tragedy, which was already in rehearsal, he now withdrew from the stage, and sought reputation in a way more accordant with the decorum of his new profession, by turning prose writer. But after publishing “A True Estimate of Human Life,” with a dedication to the Queen, as one of the “most shining representatives” of God on earth, and a sermon, entitled “An Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Government,” preached before the House of Commons, his Pindaric ambition again seized him, and he matched his former ode by another, called “Imperium Pelagi, a Naval Lyric; written in imitation of Pindar’s spirit, occasioned by his Majesty’s return from Hanover, 1729, and the succeeding Peace.” Since he afterward suppressed this second ode, we must suppose that it was rather worse than the first. Next came his two “Epistles to Pope, concerning the Authors of the Age,” remarkable for nothing but the audacity of affectation with which the most servile of poets professes to despise servility. </p><p>In 1730 Young was presented by his college with the rectory of Welwyn, in Hertfordshire, and, in the following year, when he was just fifty, he married Lady Elizabeth Lee, a widow with two children, who seems to have been in favor with Queen Caroline, and who probably had an income—two attractions which doubtless enhanced the power of her other charms. Pastoral duties and domesticity probably cured Young of some bad habits; but, unhappily, they did not cure him either of flattery or of fustian. Three more odes followed, quite as bad as those of his bachelorhood, except that in the third he announced the wise resolution of never writing another. It must have been about this time, since Young was now “turned of fifty,” that he wrote the letter to Mrs. Howard (afterward Lady Suffolk), George the Second’s mistress, which proves that he used other engines, besides Pindaric ones, in “besieging Court favor.” The letter is too characteristic to be omitted: </p><p>“Monday Morning. </p><p>“MADAM: I know his Majesty’s goodness to his servants, and his love of justice in general, so well, that I am confident, if his Majesty knew my case, I should not have any cause to despair of his gracious favor to me. </p><p>“Abilities.  Want.</p><p>Good Manners.  Sufferings  }</p><p>Service.  and  } for his Majesty.</p><p>Age.  Zeal  }</p><p>These, madam, are the proper points of consideration in the person that humbly hopes his Majesty’s favor. </p><p>“As to Abilities, all I can presume to say is, I have done the best I could to improve them. </p><p>“As to Good manners, I desire no favor, if any just objection lies against them. </p><p>“As for Service, I have been near seven years in his Majesty’s and never omitted any duty in it, which few can say. </p><p>“As for Age, I am turned of fifty. </p><p>“As for Want, I have no manner of preferment. </p><p>“As for Sufferings, I have lost £300 per ann. by being in his Majesty’s service; as I have shown in a Representation which his Majesty has been so good as to read and consider. </p><p>“As for Zeal, I have written nothing without showing my duty to their Majesties, and some pieces are dedicated to them. </p><p>“This, madam, is the short and true state of my case. They that make their court to the ministers, and not their Majesties, succeed better. If my case deserves some consideration, and you can serve me in it, I humbly hope and believe you will: I shall, therefore, trouble you no farther; but beg leave to subscribe myself, with truest respect and gratitude, </p><p>“Yours, etc., </p><p>EDWARD YOUNG. </p><p>“P.S. I have some hope that my Lord Townshend is my friend; if therefore soon, and before he leaves the court, you had an opportunity of mentioning me, with that favor you have been so good to show, I think it would not fail of success; and, if not, I shall owe you more than any.”—“Suffolk Letters,” vol. i. p. 285. </p><p>Young’s wife died in 1741, leaving him one son, born in 1733. That he had attached himself strongly to her two daughters by her former marriage, there is better evidence in the report, mentioned by Mrs. Montagu, of his practical kindness and liberality to the younger, than in his lamentations over the elder as the “Narcissa” of the “Night Thoughts.” “Narcissa” had died in 1735, shortly after marriage to Mr. Temple, the son of Lord Palmerston; and Mr. Temple himself, after a second marriage, died in 1740, a year before Lady Elizabeth Young. These, then, are the three deaths supposed to have inspired “The Complaint,” which forms the three first books of the “Night Thoughts:” </p><p>“Insatiate archer, could not one suffice? </p><p>Thy shaft flew thrice: and thrice my peace was slain: </p><p>And thrice, ere thrice yon moon had fill’d her horn.” </p><p>Since we find Young departing from the truth of dates, in order to heighten the effect of his calamity, or at least of his climax, we need not be surprised that he allowed his imagination great freedom in other matters besides chronology, and that the character of “Philander” can, by no process, be made to fit Mr. Temple. The supposition that the much-lectured “Lorenzo” of the “Night Thoughts” was Young’s own son is hardly rendered more absurd by the fact that the poem was written when that son was a boy, than by the obvious artificiality of the characters Young introduces as targets for his arguments and rebukes. Among all the trivial efforts of conjectured criticism, there can hardly be one more futile than the attempts to discover the original of those pitiable lay-figures, the “Lorenzos” and “Altamonts” of Young’s didactic prose and poetry. His muse never stood face to face with a genuine living human being; she would have been as much startled by such an encounter as a necromancer whose incantations and blue fire had actually conjured up a demon.</p><p>The “Night Thoughts” appeared between 1741 and 1745. Although he declares in them that he has chosen God for his “patron” henceforth, this is not at all to the prejudice of some half dozen lords, duchesses, and right honorables who have the privilege of sharing finely-turned compliments with their co-patron. The line which closed the Second Night in the earlier editions— </p><p>“Wits spare not Heaven, O Wilmington!—nor thee”— </p><p>is an intense specimen of that perilous juxtaposition of ideas by which Young, in his incessant search after point and novelty, unconsciously converts his compliments into sarcasms; and his apostrophe to the moon as more likely to be favorable to his song if he calls her “fair Portland of the skies,” is worthy even of his Pindaric ravings. His ostentatious renunciation of worldly schemes, and especially of his twenty-years’ siege of Court favor, are in the tone of one who retains some hope in the midst of his querulousness. </p><p>He descended from the astronomical rhapsodies of his “Ninth Night,” published in 1745, to more terrestrial strains in his “Reflections on the Public Situation of the Kingdom,” dedicated to the Duke of Newcastle; but in this critical year we get a glimpse of him through a more prosaic and less refracting medium. He spent a part of the year at Tunbridge Wells; and Mrs. Montagu, who was there too, gives a very lively picture of the “divine Doctor” in her letters to the Duchess of Portland, on whom Young had bestowed the superlative bombast to which we have recently alluded. We shall borrow the quotations from Dr. Doran, in spite of their length, because, to our mind, they present the most agreeable portrait we possess of Young: </p><p>“I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I disturbed in a reverie. At first he started, then bowed, then fell back into a surprise; then began a speech, relapsed into his astonishment two or three times, forgot what he had been saying; began a new subject, and so went on. I told him your grace desired he would write longer letters; to which he cried ‘Ha!’ most emphatically, and I leave you to interpret what it meant. He has made a friendship with one person here, whom I believe you would not imagine to have been made for his bosom friend. You would, perhaps, suppose it was a bishop or dean, a prebend, a pious preacher, a clergyman of exemplary life, or, if a layman, of most virtuous conversation, one that had paraphrased St. Matthew, or wrote comments on St. Paul. . . . You would not guess that this associate of the doctor’s was—old Cibber! Certainly, in their religious, moral, and civil character, there is no relation; but in their dramatic capacity there is some.—Mrs. Montagu was not aware that Cibber, whom Young had named not disparagingly in his Satires, was the brother of his old school-fellow; but to return to our hero. ‘The waters,’ says Mrs. Montagu, ‘have raised his spirits to a fine pitch, as your grace will imagine, when I tell you how sublime an answer he made to a very vulgar question. I asked him how long he stayed at the Wells; he said, ‘As long as my rival stayed;—as long as the sun did.’ Among the visitors at the Wells were Lady Sunderland (wife of Sir Robert Sutton), and her sister, Mrs. Tichborne. ‘He did an admirable thing to Lady Sunderland: on her mentioning Sir Robert Sutton, he asked her where Sir Robert’s lady was; on which we all laughed very heartily, and I brought him off, half ashamed, to my lodgings, where, during breakfast, he assured me he had asked after Lady Sunderland, because he had a great honor for her; and that, having a respect for her sister, he designed to have inquired after her, if we had not put it out of his head by laughing at him. You must know, Mrs. Tichborne sat next to Lady Sunderland. It would have been admirable to have had him finish his compliment in that manner.’ . . . ‘His expressions all bear the stamp of novelty, and his thoughts of sterling sense. He practises a kind of philosophical abstinence. . . . He carried Mrs. Rolt and myself to Tunbridge, five miles from hence, where we were to see some fine old ruins. First rode the doctor on a tall steed, decently caparisoned in dark gray; next, ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney horse; . . . then followed your humble servant on a milk-white palfrey. I rode on in safety, and at leisure to observe the company, especially the two figures that brought up the rear. The first was my servant, valiantly armed with two uncharged pistols; the last was the doctor’s man, whose uncombed hair so resembled the mane of the horse he rode, one could not help imagining they were of kin, and wishing, for the honor of the family, that they had had one comb betwixt them. On his head was a velvet cap, much resembling a black saucepan, and on his side hung a little basket. At last we arrived at the King’s Head, where the loyalty of the doctor induced him to alight; and then, knight-errant-like, he took his damsels from off their palfreys, and courteously handed us into the inn.’ . . . The party returned to the Wells; and ‘the silver Cynthia held up her lamp in the heavens’ the while. ‘The night silenced all but our divine doctor, who sometimes uttered things fit to be spoken in a season when all nature seems to be hushed and hearkening. I followed, gathering wisdom as I went, till I found, by my horse’s stumbling, that I was in a bad road, and that the blind was leading the blind. So I placed my servant between the doctor and myself; which he not perceiving, went on in a most philosophical strain, to the great admiration of my poor clown of a servant, who, not being wrought up to any pitch of enthusiasm, nor making any answer to all the fine things he heard, the doctor, wondering I was dumb, and grieving I was so stupid, looked round and declared his surprise.’”</p><p>Young’s oddity and absence of mind are gathered from other sources besides these stories of Mrs. Montagu’s, and gave rise to the report that he was the original of Fielding’s “Parson Adams;” but this Croft denies, and mentions another Young, who really sat for the portrait, and who, we imagine, had both more Greek and more genuine simplicity than the poet. His love of chatting with Colley Cibber was an indication that the old predilection for the stage survived, in spite of his emphatic contempt for “all joys but joys that never can expire;” and the production of “The Brothers,” at Drury Lane in 1753, after a suppression of fifteen years, was perhaps not entirely due to the expressed desire to give the proceeds to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The author’s profits were not more than £400—in those days a disappointing sum; and Young, as we learn from his friend Richardson, did not make this the limit of his donation, but gave a thousand guineas to the Society. “I had some talk with him,” says Richardson, in one of his letters, “about this great action. ‘I always,’ said he, ‘intended to do something handsome for the Society. Had I deferred it to my demise, I should have given away my son’s money. All the world are inclined to pleasure; could I have given myself a greater by disposing of the sum to a different use, I should have done it.’” Surely he took his old friend Richardson for “Lorenzo!” </p><p>His next work was “The Centaur not Fabulous; in Six Letters to a Friend, on the Life in Vogue,” which reads very much like the most objurgatory parts of the “Night Thoughts” reduced to prose. It is preceded by a preface which, though addressed to a lady, is in its denunciations of vice as grossly indecent and almost as flippant as the epilogues written by “friends,” which he allowed to be reprinted after his tragedies in the latest edition of his works. We like much better than “The Centaur,” “Conjectures on Original Composition,” written in 1759, for the sake, he says, of communicating to the world the well-known anecdote about Addison’s deathbed, and with the exception of his poem on Resignation, the last thing he ever published.</p><p>The estrangement from his son, which must have embittered the later years of his life, appears to have begun not many years after the mother’s death. On the marriage of her second daughter, who had previously presided over Young’s household, a Mrs. Hallows, understood to be a woman of discreet age, and the daughter (a widow) of a clergyman who was an old friend of Young’s, became housekeeper at Welwyn. Opinions about ladies are apt to differ. “Mrs. Hallows was a woman of piety, improved by reading,” says one witness. “She was a very coarse woman,” says Dr. Johnson; and we shall presently find some indirect evidence that her temper was perhaps not quite so much improved as her piety. Servants, it seems, were not fond of remaining long in the house with her; a satirical curate, named Kidgell, hints at “drops of juniper” taken as a cordial (but perhaps he was spiteful, and a teetotaller); and Young’s son is said </p><p>to have told his father that “an old man should not resign himself to the management of anybody.” The result was, that the son was banished from home for the rest of his father’s life-time, though Young seems never to have thought of disinheriting him. </p><p>Our latest glimpses of the aged poet are derived from certain letters of Mr. Jones, his curate—letters preserved in the British Museum, and happily made accessible to common mortals in Nichols’s “Anecdotes.” Mr. Jones was a man of some literary activity and ambition—a collector of interesting documents, and one of those concerned in the “Free and Candid Disquisitions,” the design of which was “to point out such things in our ecclesiastical establishment as want to be reviewed and amended.” On these and kindred subjects he corresponded with Dr. Birch, occasionally troubling him with queries and manuscripts. We have a respect for Mr. Jones. Unlike any person who ever troubled us with queries or manuscripts, he mitigates the infliction by such gifts as “a fat pullet,” wishing he “had anything better to send; but this depauperizing vicarage (of Alconbury) too often checks the freedom and forwardness of my mind.” Another day comes a “pound canister of tea,” another, a “young fatted goose.” Clearly, Mr. Jones was entirely unlike your literary correspondents of the present day; he forwarded manuscripts, but he had “bowels,” and forwarded poultry too. His first letter from Welwyn is dated June, 1759, not quite six years before Young’s death. In June, 1762, he expresses a wish to go to London “this summer. But,” he continues: </p><p>“My time and pains are almost continually taken up here, and . . . I have been (I now find) a considerable loser, upon the whole, by continuing here so long. The consideration of this, and the inconveniences I sustained, and do still experience, from my late illness, obliged me at last to acquaint the Doctor (Young) with my case, and to assure him that I plainly perceived the duty and confinement here to be too much for me; for which reason I must (I said) beg to be at liberty to resign my charge at Michaelmas. I began to give him these notices in February, when I was very ill; and now I perceive, by what he told me the other day, that he is in some difficulty: for which reason he is at last (he says) resolved to advertise, and even (which is much wondered at) to raise the salary considerably higher. (What he allowed my predecessors was 20l. per annum; and now he proposes 50l., as he tells me.) I never asked him to raise it for me, though I well knew it was not equal to the duty; nor did I say a word about myself when he lately suggested to me his intentions upon this subject.” </p><p>In a postscript to this letter he says: </p><p>“I may mention to you farther, as a friend that may be trusted, that in all likelihood the poor old gentleman will not find it a very easy matter, unless by dint of money, and force upon himself, to procure a man that he can like for his next curate, nor one that will stay with him so long as I have done. Then, his great age will recur to people’s thoughts; and if he has any foibles, either in temper or conduct, they will be sure not to be forgotten on this occasion by those who know him; and those who do not will probably be on their guard. On these and the like considerations, it is by no means an eligible office to be seeking out for a curate for him, as he has several times wished me to do; and would, if he knew that I am now writing to you, wish your assistance also. But my best friends here, who well foresee the probable consequences, and wish me well, earnestly dissuade me from complying: and I will decline the office with as much decency as I can: but high salary will, I suppose, fetch in somebody or other, soon.”</p><p>In the following July he writes: </p><p>“The old gentleman here (I may venture to tell you freely) seems to me to be in a pretty odd way of late—moping, dejected, self-willed, and as if surrounded with some perplexing circumstances. Though I visit him pretty frequently for short intervals, I say very little to his affairs, not choosing to be a party concerned, especially in cases of so critical and tender a nature. There is much mystery in almost all his temporal affairs, as well as in many of his speculative theories. Whoever lives in this neighborhood to see his exit will probably see and hear some very strange things. Time will show;—I am afraid, not greatly to his credit. There is thought to be an irremovable obstruction to his happiness within his walls, as well as another without them; but the former is the more powerful, and like to continue so. He has this day been trying anew to engage me to stay with him. No lucrative views can tempt me to sacrifice my liberty or my health, to such measures as are proposed here. Nor do I like to have to do with persons whose word and honor cannot be depended on. So much for this very odd and unhappy topic.” </p><p>In August Mr. Jones’s tone is slightly modified. Earnest entreaties, not lucrative considerations, have induced him to cheer the Doctor’s dejected heart by remaining at Welwyn some time longer. The Doctor is, “in various respects, a very unhappy man,” and few know so much of these respects as Mr. Jones. In September he recurs to the subject: </p><p>“My ancient gentleman here is still full of trouble, which moves my concern, though it moves only the secret laughter of many, and some untoward surmises in disfavor of him and his household. The loss of a very large sum of money (about 200l.) is talked of; whereof this vill and neighborhood is full. Some disbelieve; others says, ‘It is no wonder, where about eighteen or more servants are sometimes taken and dismissed in the course of a year.’ The gentleman himself is allowed by all to be far more harmless and easy in his family than some one else who hath too much the lead in it. This, among others, was one reason for my late motion to quit.” </p><p>No other mention of Young’s affairs occurs until April 2d, 1765, when he says that Dr. Young is very ill, attended by two physicians. </p><p>“Having mentioned this young gentleman (Dr. Young’s son), I would acquaint you next, that he came hither this morning, having been sent for, as I am told, by the direction of Mrs. Hallows. Indeed, she intimated to me as much herself. And if this be so, I must say, that it is one of the most prudent Acts she ever did, or could have done in such a case as this; as it may prove a means of preventing much confusion after the death of the Doctor. I have had some little discourse with the son: he seems much affected, and I believe really is so. He earnestly wishes his father might be pleased to ask after him; for you must know he has not yet done this, nor is, in my opinion, like to do it. And it has been said farther, that upon a late application made to him on the behalf of his son, he desired that no more might be said to him about it. How true this may be I cannot as yet be certain; all I shall say is, it seems not improbable . . . I heartily wish the ancient man’s heart may prove tender toward his son; though, knowing him so well, I can scarce hope to hear such desirable news.”</p><p>Eleven days later he writes: </p><p>“I have now the pleasure to acquaint you, that the late Dr. Young, though he had for many years kept his son at a distance from him, yet has now at last left him all his possessions, after the payment of certain legacies; so that the young gentleman (who bears a fair character, and behaves well, as far as I can hear or see) will, I hope, soon enjoy and make a prudent use of a handsome fortune. The father, on his deathbed, and since my return from London, was applied to in the tenderest manner, by one of his physicians, and by another person, to admit the son into his presence, to make submission, intreat forgiveness, and obtain his blessing. As to an interview with his son, he intimated that he chose to decline it, as his spirits were then low and his nerves weak. With regard to the next particular, he said, ‘I heartily forgive him;’ and upon ‘mention of this last, he gently lifted up his hand, and letting it gently fall, pronounced these words, ‘God bless him!’ . . . I know it will give you pleasure to be farther informed that he was pleased to make respectful mention of me in his will; expressing his satisfaction in my care of his parish, bequeathing to me a handsome legacy, and appointing me to be one of his executors.” </p><p>So far Mr. Jones, in his confidential correspondence with a “friend, who may be trusted.” In a letter communicated apparently by him to the Gentleman’s Magazine, seven years later, namely, in 1782, on the appearance of Croft’s biography of Young, we find him speaking of “the ancient gentleman” in a tone of reverential eulogy, quite at variance with the free comments we have just quoted. But the Rev. John Jones was probably of opinion, with Mrs. Montagu, whose contemporary and retrospective letters are also set in a different key, that “the interests of religion were connected with the character of a man so distinguished for piety as Dr. Young.” At all events, a subsequent quasi-official statement weighs nothing as evidence against contemporary, spontaneous, and confidential hints. </p><p>To Mrs. Hallows, Young left a legacy of £1000, with the request that she would destroy all his manuscripts. This final request, from some unknown cause, was not complied with, and among the papers he left behind him was the following letter from Archbishop Secker, which probably marks the date of his latest effort after preferment: </p><p>“DEANERY OF ST. PAUL’S, July 8, 1758. </p><p>“Good DR. YOUNG: I have long wondered that more suitable notice of your great merit hath not been taken by persons in power. But how to remedy the omission I see not. No encouragement hath ever been given me to mention things of this nature to his Majesty. And therefore, in all likelihood, the only consequence of doing it would be weakening the little influence which else I may possibly have on some other occasions. Your fortune and your reputation set you above the need of advancement; and your sentiments above that concern for it, on your own account, which, on that of the public, is sincerely felt by </p><p>“Your loving Brother, </p><p>“THO. CANT.” </p><p>The loving brother’s irony is severe! </p><p>Perhaps the least questionable testimony to the better side of Young’s character is that of Bishop Hildesley, who, as the vicar of a parish near Welwyn, had been Young’s neighbor for upward of twenty years. The affection of the clergy for each other, we have observed, is, like that of the fair sex, not at all of a blind and infatuated kind; and we may therefore the rather believe them when they give each other any extra-official praise. Bishop Hildesley, then writing of Young to Richardson, says: </p><p>“The impertinence of my frequent visits to him was amply rewarded; forasmuch as, I can truly say, he never received me but with agreeable open complacency; and I never left him but with profitable pleasure and improvement. He was one or other, the most modest, the most patient of contradiction, and the most informing and entertaining I ever conversed with—at least, of any man who had so just pretensions to pertinacity and reserve.” </p><p>Mr. Langton, however, who was also a frequent visitor of Young’s, informed Boswell— </p><p>“That there was an air of benevolence in his manner; but that he could obtain from him less information than he had hoped to receive from one who had lived so much in intercourse with the brightest men of what had been called the Augustan age of England; and that he showed a degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences that were then passing, which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man of such intellectual stores, of such an advanced age, and who had retired from life with declared disappointment in his expectations.” </p><p>The same substance, we know, will exhibit different qualities under different tests; and, after all, imperfect reports of individual impressions, whether immediate or traditional, are a very frail basis on which to build our opinion of a man. One’s character may be very indifferently mirrored in the mind of the most intimate neighbor; it all depends on the quality of that gentleman’s reflecting surface. </p><p>But, discarding any inferences from such uncertain evidence, the outline of Young’s character is too distinctly traceable in the well-attested facts of his life, and yet more in the self-betrayal that runs through all his works, for us to fear that our general estimate of him may be false. For, while no poet seems less easy and spontaneous than Young, no poet discloses himself more completely. Men’s minds have no hiding-place out of themselves—their affectations do but betray another phase of their nature. And if, in the present view of Young, we seem to be more intent on laying bare unfavorable facts than on shrouding them in “charitable speeches,” it is not because we have any irreverential pleasure in turning men’s characters “the seamy side without,” but because we see no great advantage in considering a man as he was not. Young’s biographers and critics have usually set out from the position that he was a great religious teacher, and that his poetry is morally sublime; and they have toned down his failings into harmony with their conception of the divine and the poet. For our own part, we set out from precisely the opposite conviction—namely, that the religious and moral spirit of Young’s poetry is low and false, and we think it of some importance to show that the “Night Thoughts” are the reflex of the mind in which the higher human sympathies were inactive. This judgment is entirely opposed to our youthful predilections and enthusiasm. The sweet garden-breath of </p><p>early enjoyment lingers about many a page of the “Night Thoughts,” and even of the “Last Day,” giving an extrinsic charm to passages of stilted rhetoric and false sentiment; but the sober and repeated reading of maturer years has convinced us that it would hardly be possible to find a more typical instance than Young’s poetry, of the mistake which substitutes interested obedience for sympathetic emotion, and baptizes egoism as religion.</p><p>* * * * * </p><p>Pope said of Young, that he had “much of a sublime genius without common-sense.” The deficiency Pope meant to indicate was, we imagine, moral rather than intellectual: it was the want of that fine sense of what is fitting in speech and action, which is often eminently possessed by men and women whose intellect is of a very common order, but who have the sincerity and dignity which can never coexist with the selfish preoccupations of vanity or interest. This was the “common-sense” in which Young was conspicuously deficient; and it was partly owing to this deficiency that his genius, waiting to be determined by the highest prize, fluttered uncertainly from effort to effort, until, when he was more than sixty, it suddenly spread its broad wing, and soared so as to arrest the gaze of other generations besides his own. For he had no versatility of faculty to mislead him. The “Night Thoughts” only differ from his previous works in the degree and not in the kind of power they manifest. Whether he writes prose or poetry, rhyme or blank verse, dramas, satires, odes, or meditations, we see everywhere the same Young—the same narrow circle of thoughts, the same love of abstractions, the same telescopic view of human things, the same appetency toward antithetic apothegm and rhapsodic climax. The passages that arrest us in his tragedies are those in which he anticipates some fine passage in the “Night Thoughts,” and where his characters are only transparent shadows </p><p>through which we see the bewigged embonpoint of the didactic poet, excogitating epigrams or ecstatic soliloquies by the light of a candle fixed in a skull. Thus, in “The Revenge,” “Alonzo,” in the conflict of jealousy and love that at once urges and forbids him to murder his wife, says: </p><p>“This vast and solid earth, that blazing sun, </p><p>Those skies, through which it rolls, must all have end. </p><p>What then is man? The smallest part of nothing. </p><p>Day buries day; month, month; and year the year! </p><p>Our life is but a chain of many deaths. </p><p>Can then Death’s self be feared? Our life much rather: </p><p>Life is the desert, life the solitude; </p><p>Death joins us to the great majority; </p><p>’Tis to be born to Plato and to Cæsar; </p><p>’Tis to be great forever; </p><p>’Tis pleasure, ’tis ambition, then, to die.” </p><p>His prose writings all read like the “Night Thoughts,” either diluted into prose or not yet crystallized into poetry. For example, in his “Thoughts for Age,” he says: </p><p>“Though we stand on its awful brink, such our leaden bias to the world, we turn our faces the wrong way; we are still looking on our old acquaintance, Time; though now so wasted and reduced, that we can see little more of him than his wings and his scythe: our age enlarges his wings to our imagination; and our fear of death, his scythe; as Time himself grows less. His consumption is deep; his annihilation is at hand.” </p><p>This is a dilution of the magnificent image— </p><p>“Time in advance behind him hides his wings, </p><p>And seems to creep decrepit with his age. </p><p>Behold him when past by! What then is seen </p><p>But his proud pinions, swifter than the winds?” </p><p>Again:</p><p>“A requesting Omnipotence? What can stun and confound thy reason more? What more can ravish and exalt thy heart? It cannot but ravish and exalt; it cannot but gloriously disturb and perplex thee, to take in all that suggests. Thou child of the dust! Thou speck of misery and sin! How abject thy weakness! how great is thy power! Thou crawler on earth, and possible (I was about to say) controller of the skies! Weigh, and weigh well, the wondrous truths I have in view: which cannot be weighed too much; which the more they are weighed, amaze the more; which to have supposed, before they were revealed, would have been as great madness, and to have presumed on as great sin, as it is now madness and sin not to believe.” </p><p>Even in his Pindaric odes, in which he made the most violent efforts against nature, he is still neither more nor less than the Young of the “Last Day,” emptied and swept of his genius, and possessed by seven demons of fustian and bad rhyme. Even here his “Ercles’ Vein” alternates with his moral platitudes, and we have the perpetual text of the “Night Thoughts:” </p><p>“Gold pleasure buys; </p><p>But pleasure dies, </p><p>For soon the gross fruition cloys; </p><p>Though raptures court, </p><p>The sense is short; </p><p>But virtue kindles living joys;— </p><p>“Joys felt alone! </p><p>Joys asked of none! </p><p>Which Time’s and fortune’s arrows miss: </p><p>Joys that subsist, </p><p>Though fates resist, </p><p>An unprecarious, endless bliss! </p><p>“Unhappy they! </p><p>And falsely gay! </p><p>Who bask forever in success; </p><p>A constant feast </p><p>Quite palls the taste, </p><p>And long enjoyment is distress.” </p><p>In the “Last Day,” again, which is the earliest thing he wrote, we have an anticipation of all his greatest faults and merits. Conspicuous among the faults is that attempt to exalt our conceptions of Deity by vulgar images and comparisons, which is so offensive in the later “Night Thoughts.” In a burst of prayer and homage to God, called forth by the contemplation of Christ coming to judgment, he asks, Who brings the change of the seasons? and answers: </p><p>“Not the great Ottoman, or Greater Czar; </p><p>Not Europe’s arbitress of peace and war!” </p><p>Conceive the soul in its most solemn moments, assuring God that it doesn’t place his power below that of Louis Napoleon or Queen Victoria! </p><p>But in the midst of uneasy rhymes, inappropriate imagery, vaulting sublimity that o’erleaps itself, and vulgar emotions, we have in this poem an occasional flash of genius, a touch of simple grandeur, which promises as much as Young ever achieved. Describing the on-coming of the dissolution of all things, he says: </p><p>“No sun in radiant glory shines on high; </p><p>No light but from the terrors of the sky.”</p><p>And again, speaking of great armies: </p><p>“Whose rear lay wrapt in night, while breaking dawn </p><p>Rous’d the broad front, and call’d the battle on.” </p><p>And this wail of the lost souls is fine: </p><p>“And this for sin? </p><p>Could I offend if I had never been? </p><p>But still increas’d the senseless, happy mass, </p><p>Flow’d in the stream, or shiver’d in the grass? </p><p>Father of mercies! Why from silent earth </p><p>Didst thou awake and curse me into birth? </p><p>Tear me from quiet, ravish me from night, </p><p>And make a thankless present of thy light? </p><p>Push into being a reverse of Thee, </p><p>And animate a clod with misery?” </p><p>But it is seldom in Young’s rhymed poems that the effect of a felicitous thought or image is not counteracted by our sense of the constraint he suffered from the necessities of rhyme—that “Gothic demon,” as he afterward called it, “which, modern poetry tasting, became mortal.” In relation to his own power, no one will question the truth of this dictum, that “blank verse is verse unfallen, uncurst; verse reclaimed, reinthroned in the true language of the gods; who never thundered nor suffered their Homer to thunder in rhyme.” His want of mastery in rhyme </p><p>is especially a drawback on the effects of his Satires; for epigrams and witticisms are peculiarly susceptible to the intrusion of a superfluous word, or to an inversion which implies constraint. Here, even more than elsewhere, the art that conceals art is an absolute requisite, and to have a witticism presented to us in limping or cumbrous rhythm is as counteractive to any electrifying effect as to see the tentative grimaces by which a comedian prepares a grotesque countenance. We discern the process, instead of being startled by the result. </p><p>This is one reason why the Satires, read seriatim, have a flatness to us, which, when we afterward read picked passages, we are inclined to disbelieve in, and to attribute to some deficiency in our own mood. But there are deeper reasons for that dissatisfaction. Young is not a satirist of a high order. His satire has neither the terrible vigor, the lacerating energy of genuine indignation, nor the humor which owns loving fellowship with the poor human nature it laughs at; nor yet the personal bitterness which, as in Pope’s characters of Sporus and Atticus, insures those living touches by virtue of which the individual and particular in Art becomes the universal and immortal. Young could never describe a real, complex human being; but what he could do with eminent success was to describe, with neat and finished point, obvious types, of manners rather than of character—to write cold and clever epigrams on personified vices and absurdities. There is no more emotion in his satire than if he were turning witty verses on a waxen image of Cupid or a lady’s glove. He has none of these felicitious epithets, none of those pregnant lines, by which Pope’s Satires have enriched the ordinary speech of educated men. Young’s wit will be found in almost every instance to consist in that antithetic combination of ideas which, of all the forms of wit, is most within reach of a clever effort. In his gravest arguments, as well as in his lightest satire, one might imagine that he had set himself to work out the problem, how much antithesis might be got out of a given subject. And there he completely succeeds. His neatest portraits are all wrought on this plan. “Narcissus,” for example, who </p><p>“Omits no duty; nor can Envy say</p><p>He miss’d, these many years, the Church or Play: </p><p>He makes no noise in Parliament, ’tis true; </p><p>But pays his debts, and visit when ’tis due; </p><p>His character and gloves are ever clean, </p><p>And then he can out-bow the bowing Dean; </p><p>A smile eternal on his lip he wears, </p><p>Which equally the wise and worthless shares. </p><p>In gay fatigues, this most undaunted chief, </p><p>Patient of idleness beyond belief, </p><p>Most charitably lends the town his face </p><p>For ornament in every public place; </p><p>As sure as cards he to th’ assembly comes, </p><p>And is the furniture of drawing-rooms: </p><p>When Ombre calls, his hand and heart are free, </p><p>And, joined to two, he fails not—to make three; </p><p>Narcissus is the glory of his race; </p><p>For who does nothing with a better grace? </p><p>To deck my list by nature were designed </p><p>Such shining expletives of human kind, </p><p>Who want, while through blank life they dream along, </p><p>Sense to be right and passion to be wrong.” </p><p>It is but seldom that we find a touch of that easy slyness which gives an additional zest to surprise; but here is an instance: </p><p>“See Tityrus, with merriment possest, </p><p>Is burst with laughter ere he hears the jest, </p><p>What need he stay, for when the joke is o’er, </p><p>His teeth will be no whiter than before.” </p><p>Like Pope, whom he imitated, he sets out with a psychological mistake as the basis of his satire, attributing all forms of folly to one passion—the love of fame, or vanity—a much grosser mistake, indeed, than Pope’s, exaggeration of the extent to which the “ruling passion” determines conduct in the individual. Not that Young is consistent in his mistake. He sometimes implies no more than what is the truth—that the love of fame is the cause, not of all follies, but of many. </p><p>Young’s satires on women are superior to Pope’s, which is only saying that they are superior to Pope’s greatest failure. We can more frequently pick out a couplet as successful than an entire sketch. Of the too emphatic “Syrena” he says: </p><p>“Her judgment just, her sentence is too strong; </p><p>Because she’s right, she’s ever in the wrong.” </p><p>Of the diplomatic “Julia:” </p><p>“For her own breakfast she’ll project a scheme, </p><p>Nor take her tea without a stratagem.” </p><p>Of “Lyce,” the old painted coquette: </p><p>“In vain the cock has summoned sprites away; </p><p>She walks at noon and blasts the bloom of day.” </p><p>Of the nymph, who, “gratis, clears religious mysteries:” </p><p>“’Tis hard, too, she who makes no use but chat </p><p>Of her religion, should be barr’d in that.”</p><p>The description of the literary belle, “Daphne,” well prefaces that of “Stella,” admired by Johnson: </p><p>“With legs toss’d high, on her sophee she sits, </p><p>Vouchsafing audience to contending wits: </p><p>Of each performance she’s the final test; </p><p>One act read o’er, she prophecies the rest; </p><p>And then, pronouncing with decisive air, </p><p>Fully convinces all the town—she’s fair. </p><p>Had lonely Daphne Hecatessa’s face, </p><p>How would her elegance of taste decrease! </p><p>Some ladies’ judgment in their features lies, </p><p>And all their genius sparkles in their eyes. </p><p>But hold, she cries, lampooner! have a care; </p><p>Must I want common sense because I’m fair? </p><p>O no; see Stella: her eyes shine as bright </p><p>As if her tongue was never in the right; </p><p>And yet what real learning, judgment, fire! </p><p>She seems inspir’d, and can herself inspire. </p><p>How then (if malice ruled not all the fair) </p><p>Could Daphne publish, and could she forbear?” </p><p>After all, when we have gone through Young’s seven Satires, we seem to have made but an indifferent meal. They are a sort of fricassee, with some little solid meat in them, and yet the flavor is not always piquant. It is curious to find him, when he pauses a moment from his satiric sketching, recurring to his old platitudes: </p><p>“Can gold calm passion, or make reason shine? </p><p>Can we dig peace or wisdom from the mine? </p><p>Wisdom to gold prefer;”— </p><p>platitudes which he seems inevitably to fall into, for the same reason that some men are constantly asserting their contempt for criticism—because he felt the opposite so keenly. </p><p>The outburst of genius in the earlier books of the “Night Thoughts” is the more remarkable, that in the interval between them and the Satires he had produced nothing but his Pindaric odes, in which he fell far below the level of his previous works. Two sources of this sudden strength were the freedom of blank verse and the presence of a genuine emotion. Most persons, in speaking of the “Night Thoughts,” have in their minds only the two or three first Nights, the majority of readers rarely getting beyond these, unless, as Wilson says, they “have but few books, are poor, and live in the country.” And in these earlier Nights there is enough genuine sublimity and genuine sadness to bribe us into too favorable a judgment of them as a whole. Young had only a very few things to say or sing—such as that life is vain, that death is imminent, that man is immortal, that virtue is wisdom, that friendship is sweet, and that the source of virtue is the contemplation of death and immortality—and even in his two first Nights he had said almost all he had to say in his finest manner. Through these first outpourings of “complaint” we feel that the poet is really sad, that the bird is singing over a rifled nest; and we bear with his morbid picture of the world and of life, as the Job-like lament of a man whom “the hand of God hath touched.” Death has carried away his best-beloved, and that “silent land” whither they are gone has more reality for the desolate one than this world which is empty of their love: </p><p>“This is the desert, this the solitude;</p><p>How populous, how vital is the grave!” </p><p>Joy died with the loved one: </p><p>“The disenchanted earth </p><p>Lost all her lustre. Where her glitt’ring towers? </p><p>Her golden mountains, where? All darkened down </p><p>To naked waste; a dreary vale of tears: </p><p>The great magician’s dead!” </p><p>Under the pang of parting, it seems to the bereaved man as if love were only a nerve to suffer with, and he sickens at the thought of every joy of which he must one day say—“it was.” In its unreasoning anguish, the soul rushes to the idea of perpetuity as the one element of bliss: </p><p>“O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!— </p><p>Could ye, so rich in rapture, fear an end,— </p><p>That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy, </p><p>And quite unparadise the realms of light.” </p><p>In a man under the immediate pressure of a great sorrow, we tolerate morbid exaggerations; we are prepared to see him turn away a weary eye from sunlight and flowers and sweet human faces, as if this rich and glorious life had no significance but as a preliminary of death; we do not criticise his views, we compassionate his feelings. And so it is with Young in these earlier Nights. There is already some artificiality even in his grief, and feeling often slides into rhetoric, but through it all we are thrilled with the unmistakable cry of pain, which makes us </p><p>tolerant of egoism and hyperbole: </p><p>“In every varied posture, place, and hour, </p><p>How widow’d every thought of every joy! </p><p>Thought, busy thought! too busy for my peace! </p><p>Through the dark postern of time long elapsed </p><p>Led softly, by the stillness of the night,— </p><p>Led like a murderer (and such it proves!) </p><p>Strays (wretched rover!) o’er the pleasing past,— </p><p>In quest of wretchedness, perversely strays; </p><p>And finds all desert now; and meets the ghosts </p><p>Of my departed joys.” </p><p>But when he becomes didactic, rather than complaining—when he ceases to sing his sorrows, and begins to insist on his opinions—when that distaste for life which we pity as a transient feeling is thrust upon us as a theory, we become perfectly cool and critical, and are not in the least inclined to be indulgent to false views and selfish sentiments. </p><p>Seeing that we are about to be severe on Young’s failings and failures, we ought, if a reviewer’s space were elastic, to dwell also on his merits—on the startling vigor of his imagery—on the occasional grandeur of his thought—on the piquant force of that grave satire into which his meditations continually run. But, since our “limits” are rigorous, we must content ourselves with the less agreeable half of the critic’s duty; and we may the rather do so, because it would be difficult to say anything new of Young, in the way of admiration, while we think there are many salutary lessons remaining to be drawn from his faults. </p><p>One of the most striking characteristics of Young is his radical insincerity as a poetic artist. This, added to the thin and artificial texture of his wit, is the true explanation of the paradox—that a poet who is often inopportunely witty has the opposite vice of bombastic absurdity. The source of all grandiloquence is the want of taking for a criterion the true qualities of the object described or the emotion expressed. The grandiloquent man is never bent on saying what he feels or what he sees, but on producing a certain effect on his audience; hence he may float away into utter inanity without meeting any criterion to arrest him. Here lies the distinction between grandiloquence and genuine fancy or bold imaginativeness. The fantastic or the boldly imaginative poet may be as sincere as the most realistic: he is true to his own sensibilities or inward vision, and in his wildest flights he never breaks loose from his criterion—the truth of his own mental state. Now, this disruption of language from genuine thought and feeling is what we are constantly detecting in Young; and his insincerity is the more likely to betray him into absurdity, because he habitually treats of abstractions, and not of concrete objects or specific emotions. He descants perpetually on virtue, religion, “the good man,” life, death, immortality, eternity—subjects which are apt to give a factitious grandeur to empty wordiness. When a poet floats in the empyrean, and only takes a bird’s-eye view of the earth, some people accept the mere fact of his soaring for sublimity, and mistake his dim vision of earth for proximity to heaven. Thus:</p><p>“His hand the good man fixes on the skies, </p><p>And bids earth roll, nor feels her idle whirl,” </p><p>may, perhaps, pass for sublime with some readers. But pause a moment to realize the image, and the monstrous absurdity of a man’s grasping the skies, and hanging habitually suspended there, while he contemptuously bids the earth roll, warns you that no genuine feeling could have suggested so unnatural a conception. Again, </p><p>“See the man immortal: him, I mean, </p><p>Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on Heaven, </p><p>Leans all that way, his bias to the stars.” </p><p>This is worse than the previous example: for you can at least form some imperfect conception of a man hanging from the skies, though the position strikes you as uncomfortable and of no particular use; but you are utterly unable to imagine how his heart can lean toward the stars. Examples of such vicious imagery, resulting from insincerity, may be found, perhaps, in almost every page of the “Night Thoughts.” But simple assertions or aspirations, undisguised by imagery, are often equally false. No writer whose rhetoric was checked by the slightest truthful intentions could have said— </p><p>“An eye of awe and wonder let me roll, </p><p>And roll forever.” </p><p>Abstracting the more poetical associations with the eye, this is hardly less absurd than if he had wished to stand forever with his mouth open. </p><p>Again: </p><p>“Far beneath </p><p>A soul immortal is a mortal joy.” </p><p>Happily for human nature, we are sure no man really believes that. Which of us has the impiety not to feel that our souls are only too narrow for the joy of looking into the trusting eyes of our children, of reposing on the love of a husband or a wife—nay, of listening to the divine voice of music, or watching the calm brightness of autumnal afternoons? But Young could utter this falsity without detecting it, because, when he spoke of “mortal joys,” he rarely had in his mind any object to which he could attach sacredness. He was thinking of bishoprics, and benefices, of smiling monarchs, patronizing prime ministers, and a “much indebted muse.” Of anything between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and moderately conscious. Often, indeed, he sinks very much below even the bishopric, and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but such as breathes gaslight and the fumes of wine. His picture of life is precisely such as you would expect from a man who has risen from his bed at two o’clock in the afternoon with a headache and a dim remembrance that he has added to his “debts of honor:”</p><p>“What wretched repetition cloys us here! </p><p>What periodic potions for the sick, </p><p>Distemper’d bodies, and distemper’d minds?” </p><p>And then he flies off to his usual antithesis: </p><p>“In an eternity what scenes shall strike! </p><p>Adventures thicken, novelties surprise!” </p><p>“Earth” means lords and levees, duchesses and Dalilahs, South-Sea dreams, and illegal percentage; and the only things distinctly preferable to these are eternity and the stars. Deprive Young of this antithesis, and more than half his eloquence would be shrivelled up. Place him on a breezy common, where the furze is in its golden bloom, where children are playing, and horses are standing in the sunshine with fondling necks, and he would have nothing to say. Here are neither depths of guilt nor heights of glory; and we doubt whether in such a scene he would be able to pay his usual compliment to the Creator: </p><p>“Where’er I turn, what claim on all applause!” </p><p>It is true that he sometimes—not often—speaks of virtue as capable of sweetening life, as well as of taking the sting from death and winning heaven; and, lest we should be guilty of any unfairness to him, we will quote the two passages which convey this sentiment the most explicitly. In the one he gives “Lorenzo” this excellent recipe for obtaining cheerfulness: </p><p>“Go, fix some weighty truth; </p><p>Chain down some passion; do some generous good; </p><p>Teach Ignorance to see, or Grief to smile; </p><p>Correct thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe; </p><p>Or, with warm heart, and confidence divine, </p><p>Spring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee.” </p><p>The other passage is vague, but beautiful, and its music has murmured in our minds for many years: </p><p>“The cuckoo seasons sing </p><p>The same dull note to such as nothing prize </p><p>But what those seasons from the teeming earth </p><p>To doting sense indulge. But nobler minds, </p><p>Which relish fruit unripened by the sun, </p><p>Make their days various; various as the dyes </p><p>On the dove’s neck, which wanton in his rays. </p><p>On minds of dove-like innocence possess’d, </p><p>On lighten’d minds that bask in Virtue’s beams, </p><p>Nothing hangs tedious, nothing old revolves </p><p>In that for which they long, for which they live. </p><p>Their glorious efforts, winged with heavenly hopes, </p><p>Each rising morning sees still higher rise;</p><p>Each bounteous dawn its novelty presents </p><p>To worth maturing, new strength, lustre, fame; </p><p>While Nature’s circle, like a chariot wheel, </p><p>Boiling beneath their elevated aims, </p><p>Makes their fair prospect fairer every hour; </p><p>Advancing virtue in a line to bliss.” </p><p>Even here, where he is in his most amiable mood, you see at what a telescopic distance he stands from mother Earth and simple human joys—“Nature’s circle rolls beneath.” Indeed, we remember no mind in poetic literature that seems to have absorbed less of the beauty and the healthy breath of the common landscape than Young’s. His images, often grand and finely presented—witness that sublimely sudden leap of thought, </p><p>“Embryos we must be till we burst the shell, </p><p>Yon ambient azure shell, and spring to life”— </p><p>lie almost entirely within that circle of observation which would be familiar to a man who lived in town, hung about the theatres, read the newspaper, and went home often by moon and starlight. </p><p>There is no natural object nearer than the moon that seems to have any strong attraction for him, and even to the moon he chiefly appeals for patronage, and “pays his court” to her. It is reckoned among the many deficiencies of “Lorenzo” that he “never asked the moon one question”—an omission which Young thinks eminently unbecoming a rational being. He describes nothing so well as a comet, and is tempted to linger with fond detail over nothing more familiar than the day of judgment and an imaginary journey among the stars. Once on Saturn’s ring he feels at </p><p>home, and his language becomes quite easy: </p><p>“What behold I now? </p><p>A wilderness of wonders burning round, </p><p>Where larger suns inhabit higher spheres; </p><p>Perhaps the villas of descending gods!” </p><p>It is like a sudden relief from a strained posture when, in the “Night Thoughts,” we come on any allusion that carries us to the lanes, woods, or fields. Such allusions are amazingly rare, and we could almost count them on a single hand. That we may do him no injustice, we will quote the three best: </p><p>“Like blossom’d trees o’erturned by vernal storm, </p><p>Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay. </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“In the same brook none ever bathed him twice: </p><p>To the same life none ever twice awoke. </p><p>We call the brook the same—the same we think </p><p>Our life, though still more rapid in its flow; </p><p>Nor mark the much irrevocably lapsed </p><p>And mingled with the sea.” </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“The crown of manhood is a winter joy; </p><p>An evergreen that stands the northern blast, </p><p>And blossoms in the rigor of our fate.”</p><p>The adherence to abstractions, or to the personification of abstractions, is closely allied in Young to the want of genuine emotion. He sees virtue sitting on a mount serene, far above the mists and storms of earth; he sees Religion coming down from the skies, with this world in her left hand and the other world in her right; but we never find him dwelling on virtue or religion as it really exists—in the emotions of a man dressed in an ordinary coat, and seated by his fireside of an evening, with his hand resting on the head of his little daughter, in </p><p>courageous effort for unselfish ends, in the internal triumph of justice and pity over personal resentment, in all the sublime self-renunciation and sweet charities which are found in the details of ordinary life. Now, emotion links itself with particulars, and only in a faint and secondary manner with abstractions. An orator may discourse very eloquently on injustice in general, and leave his audience cold; but let him state a special case of oppression, and every heart will throb. The most untheoretic persons are aware of this relation between true emotion and particular facts, as opposed to general terms, and implicitly recognize it in the repulsion they feel toward any one who professes strong feeling about abstractions—in the interjectional “Humbug!” which immediately rises to their lips. Wherever abstractions appear to excite strong emotion, this occurs in men of active intellect and imagination, in whom the abstract term rapidly and vividly calls up the particulars it represents, these particulars being the true source of the emotion; and such men, if they wished to express their feeling, would be infallibly prompted to the presentation of details. Strong emotion can no more be directed to generalities apart from particulars, than skill in figures can be directed to arithmetic apart from numbers. Generalities are the refuge at once of deficient intellectual activity and deficient feeling. </p><p>If we except the passages in “Philander,” “Narcissa,” and “Lucia,” there is hardly a trace of human sympathy, of self-forgetfulness in the joy or sorrow of a fellow-being, throughout this long poem, which professes to treat the various phases of man’s destiny. And even in the “Narcissa” Night, Young repels us by the low moral tone of his exaggerated lament. This married step-daughter died at Lyons, and, being a Protestant, was denied burial, so that her friends had to bury her in secret—one of the many miserable results of superstition, but not a fact to throw an educated, still less a Christian man, into a fury of hatred and vengeance, in contemplating it after the lapse of five years. Young, however, takes great pains to simulate a bad feeling: </p><p>“Of grief </p><p>And indignation rival bursts I pour’d, </p><p>Half execration mingled with my pray’r; </p><p>Kindled at man, while I his God adored; </p><p>Sore grudg’d the savage land her sacred dust; </p><p>Stamp’d the cursed soil; and with humanity </p><p>(Denied Narcissa) wish’d them all a grave.” </p><p>The odiously bad taste of this last clause makes us hope that it is simply a platitude, and not intended as witticism, until he removes the possibility of this favorable doubt by immediately asking, “Flows my resentment into guilt?” </p><p>When, by an afterthought, he attempts something like sympathy, he only betrays more clearly his want of it. Thus, in the first Night, when he turns from his private griefs to depict earth as a hideous abode of misery for all mankind, and asks, </p><p>“What then am I, who sorrow for myself?” </p><p>he falls at once into calculating the benefit of sorrowing for others:</p><p>“More generous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts; </p><p>And conscious virtue mitigates the pang. </p><p>Nor virtue, more than prudence, bids me give </p><p>Swollen thought a second channel.” </p><p>This remarkable negation of sympathy is in perfect consistency with Young’s theory of ethics: </p><p>“Virtue is a crime, </p><p>A crime of reason, if it costs us pain </p><p>Unpaid.” </p><p>If there is no immortality for man— </p><p>“Sense! take the rein; blind Passion, drive us on; </p><p>And Ignorance! befriend us on our way. . . </p><p>Yes; give the pulse full empire; live the Brute, </p><p>Since as the brute we die. The sum of man, </p><p>Of godlike man, to revel and to rot.” </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“If this life’s gain invites him to the deed, </p><p>Why not his country sold, his father slain?” </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“Ambition, avarice, by the wise disdain’d, </p><p>Is perfect wisdom, while mankind are fools, </p><p>And think a turf or tombstone covers all.” </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“Die for thy country, thou romantic fool! </p><p>Seize, seize the plank thyself, and let her sink.” </p><p>* * * * * </p><p>“As in the dying parent dies the child, </p><p>Virtue with Immortality expires. </p><p>Who tells me he denies his soul immortal, </p><p>Whate’er his boost, has told me he’s a knave. </p><p>His duty ’tis to love himself alone. </p><p>Nor care though mankind perish if he smiles.” </p><p>We can imagine the man who “denies his soul immortal,” replying, “It is quite possible that you would be a knave, and love yourself alone, if it were not for your belief in immortality; but you are not to force upon me what would result from your own utter want of moral emotion. I am just and honest, not because I expect to live in another world, but because, having felt the pain of injustice and dishonesty toward myself, I have a fellow-feeling with other men, who would suffer the same pain if I were unjust or dishonest toward them. Why should I give my neighbor short weight in this world, because there is not another world in which I should have nothing to weigh out to him? I am honest, because I don’t like to inflict evil on others in this life, not because I’m afraid of evil to myself in another. The fact is, I do not love myself alone, whatever logical necessity there may be for that in your mind. I have a tender love for my wife, and children, and friends, and through that love I sympathize with like affections in other men. It is a pang to me to witness the sufferings of a fellow-being, and I feel his suffering the more acutely because he is mortal—because his life is so short, and I would have it, if possible, filled with happiness and not misery. Through my union and fellowship with the men and women I have seen, I feel a like, though a fainter, sympathy with those I have not seen; and I am able so to live in imagination with the generations to come, that their good is not alien to me, and is a stimulus to me to labor for ends which may not benefit myself, but will benefit them. It is possible that you may prefer to ‘live the brute,’ to sell your country, or to slay your father, if you were not afraid of some disagreeable consequences from the criminal laws of another world; but even if I could conceive no motive but my own worldly interest or the gratification of my animal desire, I have not observed that beastliness, treachery, and parricide are the direct way to happiness and comfort on earth. And I should say, that if you feel no motive to common morality but your fear of a criminal bar in heaven, you are decidedly a man for the police on earth to keep their eye upon, since it is matter of world-old experience that fear of distant consequences is a very insufficient barrier against the rush of immediate desire. Fear of consequences is only one form of egoism, which will</p><p>hardly stand against half a dozen other forms of egoism bearing down upon it. And in opposition to your theory that a belief in immortality is the only source of virtue, I maintain that, so far as moral action is dependent on that belief, so far the emotion which prompts it is not truly moral—is still in the stage of egoism, and has not yet attained the higher development of sympathy. In proportion as a man would care less for the rights and welfare of his fellow, if he did not believe in a future life, in that proportion is he wanting in the genuine feelings of justice and benevolence; as the musician who would care less to play a sonata of Beethoven’s finely in solitude than in public, where he was to be paid for it, is wanting in genuine enthusiasm for music.” </p><p>Thus far might answer the man who “denies himself immortal;” and, allowing for that deficient recognition of the finer and more indirect influences exercised by the idea of immortality which might be expected from one who took up a dogmatic position on such a subject, we think he would have given a sufficient reply to Young and other theological advocates who, like him, pique themselves on the loftiness of their doctrine when they maintain that “virtue with immortality expires.” We may admit, indeed, that if the better part of virtue consists, as Young appears to think, in contempt for mortal joys, in “meditation of our own decease,” and in “applause” of God in the style of a congratulatory address to Her Majesty—all which has small relation to the well-being of mankind on this earth—the motive to it must be gathered from something that lies quite outside the sphere of human sympathy. But, for certain other elements of virtue, which are of more obvious importance to untheological minds—a delicate sense of our neighbor’s rights, an active participation in the joys and sorrows of our fellow-men, a magnanimous acceptance of privation or suffering for ourselves when it is the condition of good to others, in a word, the extension and intensification of our sympathetic nature—we think it of some importance to contend that they have no more direct relation to the belief in a future state than the interchange of gases in the lungs has to the plurality of worlds. Nay, to us it is conceivable that in some minds the deep pathos lying in the thought of human mortality—that we are here for a little while and then vanish away, that this earthly life is all that is given to our loved ones and to our many suffering fellow-men—lies nearer the fountains of moral emotion than the conception of extended existence. And surely it ought to be a welcome fact, if the thought of mortality, as well as of immortality, be favorable to virtue. Do writers of sermons and religious novels prefer that men should be vicious in order that there may be a more evident political and social necessity for printed sermons and clerical fictions? Because learned gentlemen are theological, are we to have no more simple honesty and good-will? We can imagine that the proprietors of a patent water-supply have a dread of common springs; but, for our own part, we think there cannot be too great a security against a lack of fresh water or of pure morality. To us it is a matter of unmixed rejoicing that this latter necessary of healthful life is independent of theological ink, and that its evolution is insured in the interaction of human souls as certainly as the evolution of science or of art, with which, indeed, it is but a twin ray, melting into them with undefinable limits.</p><p>To return to Young. We can often detect a man’s deficiencies in what he admires more clearly than in what he contemns—in the sentiments he presents as laudable rather than in those he decries. And in Young’s notion of what is lofty he casts a shadow by which we can measure him without further trouble. For example, in arguing for human immortality, he says: </p><p>“First, what is true ambition? The pursuit </p><p>Of glory nothing less than man can share. </p><p>* * * * </p><p>The Visible and Present are for brutes, </p><p>A slender portion, and a narrow bound! </p><p>These Reason, with an energy divine, </p><p>O’erleaps, and claims the Future and Unseen; </p><p>The vast Unseen, the Future fathomless! </p><p>When the great soul buoys up to this high point, </p><p>Leaving gross Nature’s sediments below, </p><p>Then, and then only, Adam’s offspring quits </p><p>The sage and hero of the fields and woods, </p><p>Asserts his rank, and rises into man.” </p><p>So, then, if it were certified that, as some benevolent minds have tried to infer, our dumb fellow-creatures would share a future existence, in which it is to be hoped we should neither beat, starve, nor maim them, our ambition for a future life would cease to be “lofty!” This is a notion of loftiness which may pair off with Dr. Whewell’s celebrated observation, that Bentham’s moral theory is low because it includes justice and mercy to brutes. </p><p>But, for a reflection of Young’s moral personality on a colossal scale, we must turn to those passages where his rhetoric is at its utmost stretch of inflation—where he addresses the Deity, discourses of the Divine operations, or describes the last judgment. As a compound of vulgar pomp, crawling adulation, and hard selfishness, presented under the guise of piety, there are few things in literature to surpass the Ninth Night, entitled “Consolation,” especially in the pages where he describes the last judgment—a subject to which, with naïve self-betrayal, he applies phraseology, favored by the exuberant penny-a-liner. Thus, when God descends, and the groans of hell are opposed by “shouts of joy,” much as cheers and groans contend at a public meeting where the resolutions are not passed unanimously, the poet completes his climax in this way: </p><p>“Hence, in one peal of loud, eternal praise, </p><p>The charmed spectators thunder their applause.” </p><p>In the same taste he sings: </p><p>“Eternity, the various sentence past, </p><p>Assigns the sever’d throng distinct abodes, </p><p>Sulphureous or ambrosial.” </p><p>Exquisite delicacy of indication! He is too nice to be specific as to the interior of the “sulphureous” abode; but when once half the human race are shut up there, hear how he enjoys turning the key on them! </p><p>“What ensues? </p><p>The deed predominant, the deed of deeds! </p><p>Which makes a hell of hell, a heaven of heaven! </p><p>The goddess, with determin’d aspect turns </p><p>Her adamantine key’s enormous size </p><p>Through Destiny’s inextricable wards, </p><p>Deep driving every bolt on both their fates. </p><p>Then, from the crystal battlements of heaven, </p><p>Down, down she hurls it through the dark profound, </p><p>Ten thousand, thousand fathom; there to rust </p><p>And ne’er unlock her resolution more. </p><p>The deep resounds; and Hell, through all her glooms, </p><p>Returns, in groans, the melancholy roar.” </p><p>This is one of the blessings for which Dr. Young thanks God “most:” </p><p>“For all I bless thee, most, for the severe; </p><p>Her death—my own at hand—the fiery gulf, </p><p>That flaming bound of wrath omnipotent! </p><p>It thunders;—but it thunders to preserve; </p><p>. . . its wholesome dread </p><p>Averts the dreaded pain; its hideous groans </p><p>Join Heaven’s sweet Hallelujahs in Thy praise, </p><p>Great Source of good alone! How kind in all! </p><p>In vengeance kind! Pain, Death, Gehenna, save” . . . </p><p>i.e., save me, Dr. Young, who, in return for that favor, promise to give my divine patron the monopoly of that exuberance in laudatory epithet, of which specimens may be seen at any moment in a large number of dedications and odes to kings, queens, prime ministers, and other persons of distinction. That, in Young’s conception, is what God delights in. His crowning aim in the “drama” of the ages, is to vindicate his own renown. The God of the “Night Thoughts” is simply Young himself “writ large”—a didactic poet, who “lectures” mankind in the antithetic hyperbole of mortal and immortal joys, earth and the stars, hell and heaven; and expects the tribute of inexhaustible “applause.” Young has no conception of religion as anything else than egoism turned heavenward; and he does not merely imply this, he insists on it. Religion, he tells us, in argumentative passages too long to quote, is “ambition, pleasure, and the love of gain,” directed toward the joys of the future life instead of the present. And his ethics correspond to his religion. He vacillates, indeed, in his ethical theory, and shifts his position in order to suit his immediate purpose in argument; but he never changes his level so as to see beyond the horizon of mere selfishness. Sometimes he insists, as we have seen, that the belief in a future life is the only basis of morality; but elsewhere he tells us— </p><p>“In self-applause is virtue’s golden prize.” </p><p>Virtue, with Young, must always squint—must never look straight toward the immediate object of its emotion and effort. Thus, if a man risks perishing in the snow himself rather than forsake a weaker comrade, he must either do this because his hopes and fears are directed to another world, or because he desires to applaud himself afterward! Young, if we may believe him, would despise the action as folly unless it had these motives. Let us hope he was not so bad as he pretended to be! The tides of the divine life in man move under the thickest ice of theory.</p><p>Another indication of Young’s deficiency in moral, i.e., in sympathetic emotion, is his unintermitting habit of pedagogic moralizing. On its theoretic and perceptive side, morality touches science; on its emotional side, Art. Now, the products of Art are great in proportion as they result from that immediate prompting of innate power which we call Genius, and not from labored obedience to a theory or rule; and the presence of genius or innate prompting is directly opposed to the perpetual consciousness of a rule. The action of faculty is imperious, and excludes the reflection why it should act. In the same way, in proportion as morality is emotional, i.e., has affinity with Art, it will exhibit itself in direct sympathetic feeling and action, and not as the recognition of a rule. Love does not say, “I ought to love”—it loves. Pity does not say, “It is right to be pitiful”—it pities. Justice does not say, “I am bound to be just”—it feels justly. It is only where moral emotion is comparatively weak that the contemplation of a rule or theory habitually mingles with its action; and in accordance with this, we think experience, both in literature and life, has shown that the minds which are pre-eminently didactic—which insist on a “lesson,” and despise everything that will not convey a moral, are deficient in sympathetic emotion. A certain poet is recorded to have said that he “wished everything of his burned that did not impress some moral; even in love-verses, it might be flung in by the way.” What poet was it who took this medicinal view of poetry? Dr. Watts, or James Montgomery, or some other singer of spotless life and ardent piety? Not at all. It was Waller. A significant fact in relation to our position, that the predominant didactic tendency proceeds rather from the poet’s perception that it is good for other men to be moral, than from any overflow of moral feeling in himself. A man who is perpetually thinking in apothegms, who has an unintermittent flux of admonition, can have little energy left for simple emotion. And this is the case with Young. In his highest flights of contemplation and his most wailing soliloquies he interrupts himself to fling an admonitory parenthesis at “Lorenzo,” or to hint that “folly’s creed” is the reverse of his own. Before his thoughts can flow, he must fix his eye on an imaginary miscreant, who gives unlimited scope for lecturing, and recriminates just </p><p>enough to keep the spring of admonition and argument going to the extent of nine books. It is curious to see how this pedagogic habit of mind runs through Young’s contemplation of Nature. As the tendency to see our own sadness reflected in the external world has been called by Mr. Ruskin the “pathetic fallacy,” so we may call Young’s disposition to see a rebuke or a warning in every natural object, the “pedagogic fallacy.” To his mind, the heavens are “forever scolding as they shine;” and the great function of the stars is to be a “lecture to mankind.” The </p><p>conception of the Deity as a didactic author is not merely an implicit point of view with him; he works it out in elaborate imagery, and at length makes it the occasion of his most extraordinary achievement in the “art of sinking,” by exclaiming, à propos, we need hardly say, of the nocturnal heavens, </p><p>“Divine Instructor! Thy first volume this </p><p>For man’s perusal! all in CAPITALS!” </p><p>It is this pedagogic tendency, this sermonizing attitude of Young’s mind, which produces the wearisome monotony of his pauses. After the first two or three nights he is rarely singing, rarely pouring forth any continuous melody inspired by the spontaneous flow of thought or feeling. He is rather occupied with argumentative insistence, with hammering in the proofs of his propositions by disconnected verses, which he puts down at intervals. The perpetual recurrence of the pause at the end of the line throughout long passages makes them as fatiguing to the ear as a monotonous chant, which consists of the endless repetition of one short musical phrase. For example: </p><p>“Past hours, </p><p>If not by guilt, yet wound us by their flight, </p><p>If folly bound our prospect by the grave, </p><p>All feeling of futurity be numb’d, </p><p>All godlike passion for eternals quench’d, </p><p>All relish of realities expired; </p><p>Renounced all correspondence with the skies; </p><p>Our freedom chain’d; quite wingless our desire; </p><p>In sense dark-prison’d all that ought to soar; </p><p>Prone to the centre; crawling in the dust; </p><p>Dismounted every great and glorious aim; </p><p>Enthralled every faculty divine, </p><p>Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world.” </p><p>How different from the easy, graceful melody of Cowper’s blank verse! Indeed, it is hardly possible to criticise Young without being reminded at every step of the contrast presented to him by Cowper. And this contrast urges itself upon us the more from the fact that there is, to a certain extent, a parallelism between the “Night Thoughts” and the “Task.” In both poems the author achieves his greatest in virtue of the new freedom conferred by blank verse; both poems are professionally didactic, and mingle much satire with their graver meditations; both poems are the productions of men whose estimate of this life was formed by the light of a belief in immortality, and who were intensely attached to Christianity. On some grounds we might have anticipated a more morbid view of things from Cowper than from Young. Cowper’s religion was dogmatically the more gloomy, for he was a Calvinist; while Young was a “low” Arminian, believing that Christ died for all, and that the only obstacle to any man’s salvation lay in his will, which he could change if he chose. There was real and deep sadness involved in Cowper’s personal lot; while Young, apart from his ambitious and greedy discontent, seems to have had no great sorrow. </p><p>Yet, see how a lovely, sympathetic nature manifests itself in spite of creed and circumstance! Where is the poem that surpasses the “Task” in the genuine love it breathes, at once toward inanimate and animate existence—in truthfulness of perception and sincerity of presentation—in the calm gladness that springs from a delight in objects for their own sake, without self-reference—in divine sympathy with the lowliest pleasures, with the most short-lived capacity for pain? Here is no railing at the earth’s “melancholy map,” but the happiest lingering over </p><p>her simplest scenes with all the fond minuteness of attention that belongs to love; no pompous rhetoric about the inferiority of the “brutes,” but a warm plea on their behalf against man’s inconsiderateness and cruelty, and a sense of enlarged happiness from their companionship in enjoyment; no vague rant about human misery and human virtue, but that close and vivid presentation of particular sorrows and privations, of particular deeds and misdeeds, which is the direct road to the emotions. How Cowper’s exquisite mind falls with the mild warmth of morning sunlight on the commonest objects, at once disclosing every detail, and investing every detail with beauty! No object is too small to prompt his song—not the sooty film on the bars, or the spoutless teapot holding a bit of mignonette that serves to cheer the dingy town-lodging with a “hint that Nature lives;” and yet his song is never trivial, for he is alive to small objects, not because his mind is narrow, but because his glance is clear and his heart is large. Instead of trying to edify us by supercilious allusions to the “brutes” and the “stalls,” he interests us in that tragedy of the hen-roost when the thief has wrenched the door, </p><p>“Where Chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps </p><p>In unsuspecting pomp;” </p><p>in the patient cattle, that on the winter’s morning </p><p>“Mourn in corners where the fence </p><p>Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep </p><p>In unrecumbent sadness;” </p><p>in the little squirrel, that, surprised by him in his woodland walk, </p><p>“At once, swift as a bird, </p><p>Ascends the neighboring beech; there whisks his brush, </p><p>And perks his ears, and stamps, and cries aloud, </p><p>With all the prettiness of feign’d alarm </p><p>And anger insignificantly fierce.” </p><p>And then he passes into reflection, not with curt apothegm and snappish reproof, but with that melodious flow of utterance which belongs to thought when it is carried along in a stream of feeling: </p><p>“The heart is hard in nature, and unfit </p><p>For human fellowship, as being void </p><p>Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike </p><p>To love and friendship both, that is not pleased </p><p>With sight of animals enjoying life, </p><p>Nor feels their happiness augment his own.” </p><p>His large and tender heart embraces the most every-day forms of human life—the carter driving his team through the wintry storm; the cottager’s wife who, painfully nursing the embers on her hearth, while her infants “sit cowering o’er the sparks,” </p><p>“Retires, content to quake, so they be warm’d;” </p><p>or the villager, with her little ones, going out to pick </p><p>“A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook;” </p><p>and he compels our colder natures to follow his in its manifold sympathies, not by exhortations, not by telling us to meditate at midnight, to “indulge” the thought of death, or to ask ourselves how we shall “weather an eternal night,” but by presenting to us the object of his compassion truthfully and lovingly. And when he handles greater themes, when he takes a wider survey, and considers the men or the deeds which have a direct influence on the welfare of communities and nations, there is the same unselfish warmth of feeling, the same scrupulous </p><p>truthfulness. He is never vague in his remonstrance or his satire, but puts his finger on some particular vice or folly which excites his indignation or “dissolves his heart in pity,” because of some specific injury it does to his fellow-man or to a sacred cause. And when he is asked why he interests himself about the sorrows and wrongs of others, hear what is the reason he gives. Not, like Young, that the movements of the planets show a mutual dependence, and that </p><p>“Thus man his sovereign duty learns in this </p><p>Material picture of benevolence,” </p><p>or that— </p><p>“More generous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts, </p><p>And conscious virtue mitigates the pang.” </p><p>What is Cowper’s answer, when he imagines some “sage, erudite, profound,” asking him “What’s the world to you?” </p><p>“Much. I was born of woman, and drew milk </p><p>As sweet as charity from human breasts. </p><p>I think, articulate, I laugh and weep, </p><p>And exercise all functions of a man. </p><p>How then should I and any man that lives </p><p>Be strangers to each other?” </p><p>Young is astonished that men can make war on each other—that any one can “seize his brother’s throat,” while </p><p>“The Planets cry, ‘Forbear.’” </p><p>Cowper weeps because </p><p>“There is no flesh in man’s obdurate heart: </p><p>It does not feel for man.” </p><p>Young applauds God as a monarch with an empire and a court quite superior to the English, or as an author who produces “volumes for man’s perusal.” Cowper sees his father’s love in all the gentle pleasures of the home fireside, in the charms even of the wintry landscape, and thinks— </p><p>“Happy who walks with him! whom what he finds </p><p>Of flavor or of scent in fruit or flower, </p><p>Or what he views of beautiful or grand </p><p>In nature, from the broad, majestic oak </p><p>To the green blade that twinkles in the sun, </p><p>Prompts with remembrance of a present God.” </p><p>To conclude—for we must arrest ourselves in a contrast that would lead us beyond our bounds. Young flies for his utmost consolation to the day of judgment, when </p><p>“Final Ruin fiercely drives </p><p>Her ploughshare o’er creation;” </p><p>when earth, stars, and sun are swept aside, </p><p>“And now, all dross removed, Heaven’s own pure day, </p><p>Full on the confines of our ether, flames: </p><p>While (dreadful contrast!) far (how far!) beneath, </p><p>Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas, </p><p>And storms suphureous; her voracious jaws </p><p>Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey,” </p><p>Dr. Young and similar “ornaments of religion and virtue” passing of course with grateful “applause” into the upper region. Cowper finds his highest inspiration in the Millennium—in the restoration of this our beloved home of earth to perfect holiness and bliss, when the Supreme </p><p>“Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend </p><p>Propitious in his chariot paved with love; </p><p>And what his storms have blasted and defaced </p><p>For man’s revolt, shall with a smile repair.” </p><p>And into what delicious melody his song flows at the thought of that blessedness to be enjoyed by future generations on earth!</p><p>“The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks </p><p>Shout to each other, and the mountains tops </p><p>From distant mountains catch the flying joy; </p><p>Till, nation after nation taught the strain, </p><p>Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round!” </p><p>The sum of our comparison is this: In Young we have the type of that deficient human sympathy, that impiety toward the present and the visible, which flies for its motives, its sanctities, and its religion, to the remote, the vague, and the unknown: in Cowper we have the type of that genuine love which cherishes things in proportion to their nearness, and feels its reverence grow in proportion to the intimacy of its knowledge. </p><p>A WORD FOR THE GERMANS. </p><p>JOHN BULL is open to instruction; slowly, by gentle degrees, he revises his </p><p>opinions, his habits, and his laws. It is not to be expected that he will </p><p>ever cease to regard himself as the supreme type of manhood, or to think </p><p>that the most unmixed truth may always be known by the mark "British," </p><p>which prevents imposture. But he does modify his opinions about other </p><p>nations. It is no longer his belief that a Frenchman is invariably of the </p><p>dancing-master type, demanding nothing from existence, but "his girl, his </p><p>fiddle, and his frisk," and that if he has a soul at all it is really of too </p><p>light a quality to be worth saving. The Italian of John Bull's imagination </p><p>is no longer exclusively that dangerous jesuitical personage, with dark </p><p>hair and darker intentions, who avails himself of momentary privacy to feel </p><p>the edge of his stiletto; a personage adorned now with a false title, but in </p><p>his earlier years nothing better than a small vagrant, who went about </p><p>exhibiting his white mice and white teeth for casual halfpence. </p><p>Having shown himself thus ready to abandon those favourite old </p><p>portable notions of Frenchmen and Italians, it is a pity he should obstinately </p><p>retain certain worn-out phrases about the Germans, which hardly </p><p>imply a more comprehensive estimate. In these days when the excellent </p><p>Bull is ethnological, and feels himself at home with the widest-grinning </p><p>"natives"-nay, shows an eager anxiety as to the personal habits of the </p><p>gorilla, it might be wished that he would conceive the typical German </p><p>under some more average aspect than that of "the cloudy metaphysician." </p><p>We venture to suggest that this phrase is quite insufficient to express the </p><p>differentia of the German people. In the first place, only a small proportion </p><p>of them are metaphysicians; quite as many are bakers, making </p><p>excellent bread-not inferior, perhaps, to the British in any quality except </p><p>heaviness. Secondly, the most eminent of German metaphysicians, KANT, </p><p>is cloudy in no other sense than that in which a mathematician is cloudy </p><p>to one ignorant of mathematics. What book more nebulous than Euclid </p><p>to a reader acquainted neither with the subject-matter nor with the terminology? </p><p>What more Laputan and unpractical than algebraic formulae to </p><p>one who has never studied algebra? KANT was a rigorous thinker, </p><p>who, like all other rigorous thinkers, felt the need of terms undefaced by </p><p>long currency, free from confusing associations. The recipe for understanding </p><p>KANT is first to get brains capable of following his argument, and </p><p>next to master his terminology. Observing this recipe, the Critique of </p><p>Pure Reason is not indeed easy reading, but it is not in the least cloudy. </p><p>It is not fit for the club table. Some gentleman there, turning over the </p><p>pages and seeing such terms as synthetic judgments, antinomies, and the like,</p><p>would be conscious of superior clearness of head, and say: "Bosh! what </p><p>dreamers these Germans are!" But possibly, if that clear-headed clubman </p><p>were imperatively called upon to declare the meaning of co-efficient and </p><p>hypothenuse and assured that no smiling would be accepted as legal </p><p>tender for knowledge, he would discover that these terms also are painfully </p><p>cloudy. It is one of the interesting weaknesses common to us men to </p><p>suppose that clearness ends where our own vision fails. The sound British </p><p>thinker kicks a stone to prove that matter exists, and so confound the </p><p>metaphysicians; concluding that their arguments are necessarily shallow </p><p>because he can't see far into them. </p><p>Thirdly, we object to "cloudy metaphysician" as the accepted </p><p>periphrasis for a German, because it has begotten another habit of </p><p>speech which the most constant familiarity could not endear to us. Views </p><p>are set aside by saying that "they are German." Doubtless there is a </p><p>peculiarly German view of things as there is an English view, a French </p><p>view, a Hindu view, and so on, down to a Patagonian view, perhaps the </p><p>least metaphysical of all. The English view may be the soundest, and all </p><p>but born Englishmen may be comparatively pitiable. But the human race </p><p>has not been educated on a plan of uniformity, and it is precisely that </p><p>partition of mankind into races and nations, resulting in various national </p><p>points of view or varieties of national genius, which has been the means of </p><p>enriching and rendering more and more complete man's knowledge of the </p><p>inner and outer world. The Seventy who translated the Hebrew Scriptures </p><p>into Greek are said to have been placed in separate confinement </p><p>that each might produce his independent version, and their versions, when </p><p>afterwards compared, were found to be identical. This agreement as to </p><p>the meaning of a text was highly satisfactory, and some inconvenience </p><p>might have been saved if subsequent interpretations had been equally </p><p>harmonious. But it would have been a dreary issue for mankind, if the </p><p>division into nations had ended in such an identity of mental products, </p><p>even though the standard had been English. And no one who has an </p><p>acquaintance worth mentioning with the productions of the German mind </p><p>in any one department, is unaware that the peculiarities of that mind, its </p><p>characteristic qualities, have been the source of pre-eminently important </p><p>contributions to the sum of our mental wealth. </p><p>The German mind possesses in a high degree two tendencies which are </p><p>often represented as opposed to each other: namely, largeness of theoretic </p><p>conception, and thoroughness in the investigation of facts. So undeniable </p><p>is it that the typical German has these tendencies that their excess is the </p><p>very vice he is reproached with by those who know him and don't like </p><p>him. Your German, it is said, cannot write about the drama without going </p><p>back to the Egyptian mysteries; he sees that everything is related to </p><p>everything else, and is determined to exhaust you and the subject; his </p><p>doctrine is all-embracing, and so is his detail. Quite true. No man is </p><p>less disposed than our German to accept a too slight induction, to let pass </p><p>an inaccuracy of statement, or to report a conclusion from imperfect </p><p>observation or experiment; on the other hand, no man is more likely to be </p><p>contemptuous towards desultory labours which are not wissenschaftlich </p><p>[scientific)-i. e. not bound together by a rational doctrine, or conducted </p><p>in the full sense of a need for such a doctrine. If he is an experimentor, </p><p>he will be thorough in his experiments; if he is a scholar, he will be </p><p>thorough in his researches. Accordingly no one in this day really studies </p><p>any subject without having recourse to German books, or else wishing he </p><p>knew their language that he might have recourse to them; and the foot- </p><p>notes of every good French or English book that appears, whether in </p><p>scholarship, history, or natural science, are filled with references to German</p><p>authors. Without them, historical criticism would have been simply </p><p>nowhere; take away the Germans, with their patience, their thoroughness, </p><p>their need for a doctrine which refers all transient and material manifesta- </p><p>tions to subtler and more permanent causes, and all that we most value in </p><p>our appreciation of early history would have been wanting to us. </p><p>It is true the German rarely writes well, rarely arranges his matter well, </p><p>or manages it with economy, and therefore seldom produces a good book </p><p>in the fullest sense of the word. From the necessity his mind is under of </p><p>looking at a subject in every one of its facets, he is prone to pile one modi- </p><p>fying consideration on another, and so perpetually to disappoint a reader </p><p>who is in a hurry for a conclusion. The German is never in a hurry: for </p><p>him, art is long, and life, expanded by the absence of adventitious needs, </p><p>is not so short as for Englishmen making haste to be rich. His writing </p><p>will sometimes seem to be all stairs and landing-places without any floors. </p><p>Then the structure of his language lends itself to the formation of involved </p><p>sentences, like coiled serpents, showing neither head nor tail. Nevertheless </p><p>the proportionate badness of German books is much exaggerated. The </p><p>cumbrousness of the language apart, there is not perhaps a much larger </p><p>proportion of poor books in German than in French or English; it would be </p><p>nearer the truth to say that there are more books in German of which the matter </p><p>is valuable, and the style bad, than in any other tongue. Our own litera- </p><p>ture does not positively swarm with good writers. The difference lies </p><p>chiefly in this, that when a German author is a blockhead, he is, as HEINE </p><p>says, kein oberflachlicher Narr-no superficial blockhead: his sentences </p><p>and his book do not come to an end so soon as if he were an Englishman </p><p>or a Frenchman. He has a great deal more straw to chop, and he chops </p><p>it slowly. Still, a blockhead is never exhilarating, though he may have </p><p>learned to write in epigrams, and to give stupidity the most dapper air of </p><p>neatness. His sentences may each have a paragraph to itself, and his book </p><p>may be half white paper, but we decline it as resolutely as if it were covered </p><p>with German print without a break from beginning to end. It is as short </p><p>work not to read one book as another. </p><p>In fact, if any one in the present day can be called cultivated who </p><p>dispenses with a knowledge of German, it is because the two other greatest </p><p>literatures of the world are now impregnated with the results of German </p><p>labour and German genius. Let those who know this have the piety to </p><p>acknowledge it. Let those who do not know it abstain from pourtraying </p><p>the typical German until they have made his acquaintance. We have no </p><p>objection to caricatures; each nation should be content to lend itself to </p><p>the humour of the world in this passive way. But a caricature to be good, </p><p>must come from close observation. </p><p>SERVANTS' LOGIC. </p><p>PEOPLE who pride themselves on the correctness of their reasoning have to </p><p>suffer many mortifications. They are constantly finding that as a means of </p><p>immediate influence their carefully-drawn conclusions are quite powerless </p><p>by the side of a good bold fallacy. The majority of minds are no more </p><p>to be controlled by strong reasons than plum-pudding is to be grasped by </p><p>sharp pincers. The farther your thinker sees into the real relations of </p><p>things, the closer he makes his sequences - the farther he will be from the </p><p>possibility of carrying untrained minds along the path of his argument. </p><p>Their conclusions are determined, not at all by close sequences, but by </p><p>vague, habitual impressions and by chance associations. If our experience </p><p>of this fact had reference only to the affairs of mankind at large, it would,</p><p>perhaps, be easier to bear. We might smile (bitterly) while platform </p><p>orators held audiences spell-bound by the triumphant irrelevance of their </p><p>statements, and console ourselves with the reflection that the life of collec- </p><p>tive mankind is slowly swayed by the force of truth and not of twaddle: </p><p>our views may be hissed to-day, but in the next century they will be held </p><p>too undeniable to be applauded. Unfortunately, our keenest experience </p><p>of this [unknown] has reference to our own domestic affairs: the fellow-mortals </p><p>we most need to influence, and whose minds we find ourselves the most </p><p>incapable of grasping, are our servants, and especially our cooks. We may </p><p>look to the next country for the triumph of our ideas, but it is impossible </p><p>o [sic] look there for our dinners. When the thing to be achieved by argument </p><p>is a soup or a dish of vegetables that will not plunge you in the horrors of </p><p>dyspepsia, the immediateness of the success is everything. </p><p>In reasoning with servants we are likely to be thwarted by discovering </p><p>that our axioms are not theirs. For example, they presuppose that an </p><p>effect may exist without a cause, that like causes will constantly produce </p><p>unlike effects, that all may mean only some, that there is no difference </p><p>between little and more, that any two or more circumstances which can be </p><p>mentioned will account for a given fact, and that nothing is impossible, </p><p>except that they can have been in the wrong. Their standard measures, </p><p>too, are of a private kind; a good lump, a handful, a tea-cup, a littleish </p><p>basin, as much as will stick on your knife-end, a big spoon, and a good </p><p>sup[?]. Again, in criticizing them we are liable to use words which, not </p><p>belonging to their vocabulary, seem to be particularly opprobrious, </p><p>as in the black art gibberish was supposed to have a supernatural strength; </p><p>or we refer to some fact which happens to have a particularly offensive asso- </p><p>ciation for them unknown to us; and straightaway our quiet attempt to </p><p>convince rouses as much feeling as if we had fired off a volley of angry </p><p>rhetoric. </p><p>You, gentle madam, discover with some dismay that the scalloped </p><p>oysters with which you would fain load a friend's plate have their beards </p><p>on. The beard movement not having yet reached this point, you take an </p><p>early opportunity of asking your cook whether she is not aware that cooked </p><p>oysters ought to be bearded. "Oh, yes, mum, for soup and sauce. I put </p><p>the beards into that last little saucepan with the liquor and strain 'em; but </p><p>there's that little strainer, I must have a new one." "Yes, yes, but they </p><p>must always be bearded, however you may cook them." "What, the </p><p>natives, mum?" "All oysters; the beards are tough, unfit to be eaten." </p><p>"Well, but what we have from that little fishmonger in Brick-street? I'm </p><p>sure to pay the same price a dozen for 'em as for the last big ones, it's </p><p>imposing on them that's got the money, and I did take the knife and just </p><p>snip a beard or two off the biggest of all - we used to take 'em off at </p><p>Mrs. Tompkins's, but you've never had scalloped oysters before, and I </p><p>said to Jane, 'Jane, there'll be hardly time for these oysters to be done, </p><p>and as for that clock, it's beyond everything for loving, it deceives me, </p><p>nobody knows, and the clockmaker a whole hour at it only a week ago,'" &amp;c. </p><p>You depart with a sigh, feeling that to deposit rules in Sally's mind is very </p><p>much like depositing your thimble in a dust-heap. </p><p>You, sir, are perhaps a dyspeptic physiologist, with a weakness for </p><p>spinach, and you wish to impress upon your cook the importance of thoroughly </p><p>squeezing green vegetables. You tell her the water in which they are </p><p>boiled is as bad as poison. It follows that the next day they come up </p><p>only a little less like a soft moss[?]. "This will not do, Sally; the greens </p><p>must be squeezed perfectly dry." "La, sir, I squeezed 'em ever so long." </p><p>"But you saw there was still water left in them." "Well, sir, I'm sure it was</p><p>very little for any gentleman as can eat greens at all." You are, perhaps, </p><p>a little nettled, and you wish to be impressive; your mind goes in search </p><p>of illustration. "I tell you, there must be no water. Suppose it was </p><p>arsenic, instead of poisonous water - should you think there was no diffe- </p><p>rence between little and none?" Fatal ingenuity! Sally fires up; she has </p><p>heard of cooks being hanged for putting arsenic in food; she feels herself </p><p>unjustly accused: "I'm sure I never touched a bit of arsenic - no, not so </p><p>much as to poison a rat, for at one place where I lived the rats ran </p><p>about like mice, and the butler, as there wasn't a more respectable man any </p><p>where, he brought some arsenic home, and he said to me, as I might be </p><p>standing here-" "Nonsense, what has that to do with the greens? </p><p>Say no more, I'm in a hurry." Sally departs, muttering, and spends that </p><p>morning, not in penitence on account of ill-squeezed spinach, but under a </p><p>sense of injury from false imputations. </p><p>Again, you desire soup, but desire it without fat. You are perhaps a </p><p>genius; the world is in need of your new poem; or you are evolving a </p><p>momentous theory, and the evolution of fatty acids within you is a </p><p>serious impediment. Your mental activity is reduced to the consciousness </p><p>that interesting facts in animal chemistry are going on within you; you begin </p><p>to think you can serve mankind only by leaving your body for dissection. </p><p>At length you ask your wife with hardly suppressed peevishness, and un- </p><p>usual emphasis on "my dear," to inquire into the making of the soup. Your wife, </p><p>who is rather frightened of the cook, tells her that Mr. Queasy, in spite of </p><p>his orders, discerned fatty particles in the soup yesterday. "It's a thing </p><p>impossible there can be fat, mum - for skimming and everything - there's </p><p>nothing neglected in my power." "Show me your cold stock." Exit </p><p>Sally, returning with a vessel in one hand and a spoon in the other. </p><p>There is a white film of fat over the surface of the stock. "See, </p><p>now, Sally, there is fat!" "La, mum," says Sally, plunging her spoon in </p><p>and turning up the jellied soup from beneath as a gardener turns the soil </p><p>when he is digging for roots, the cold fat getting underneath in the process, </p><p>"that's nothing; besides, I take my soup from under, and I take the fat </p><p>off with the spoon." (The spoon itself is studded plenteously with </p><p>fragments of cold fat.) "But unless you wash your spoon each time you </p><p>dip it, there will be far, and, however little, Mr. Queasy suffers from it. </p><p>Besides" - (Mrs. Q. here exerts all her courage) - "it belongs to a good </p><p>cook to send up her soup free from fat." Sally smiles bitterly. "La, </p><p>mum, do you think, when I was at Noneham-gate, and there was people of </p><p>all sorts coming to the house, as I could have give that satisfaction - and </p><p>Scotch people wanting things you might think no Christian 'ud touch - and </p><p>Mr. Tooley, the gentleman with the wooden leg, praising my soup and </p><p>saying he never tasted better! But there's stomachs will not stand soup, </p><p>and that's where it is." (Here Sally shakes her head and sighs, as is her </p><p>wont when she is seeing deeply into the causes of things.) "And as I've </p><p>said to Jane many and many's the time, if gentlefolks' constitutions </p><p>are of that sort, it's no wonder what comes. I said so only yesterday, </p><p>when I was draining the rice, and the cat eating the white sauce all the </p><p>while, and me not knowing. It's true what I speak, every word." Here </p><p>Sally sets down the vessel of stock emphatically, and tapping the outside of </p><p>it with her finger-ends, looks hard out of the window. Mrs. Queasy is </p><p>nonplussed. If she says more Sally will give warning; she draws her dress </p><p>round her crinoline, and rustles upstairs again. </p><p>Servants are rich in intuitions. They have a vast number of certainties </p><p>which are deep by reason of their groundlessness. The postman brings a </p><p>letter for Maria: she was sure he would - she didn't know from whom it </p><p>would come, and if you were to knock her down she couldn't tell you</p><p>why; but this morning when she got out of bed, and drew up the blind </p><p>and saw the wind blowing the leaves about, she seemed to see the postman </p><p>coming with the letter in his hand. You make a great mistake if you </p><p>suggest certain conditions which might have given rise to the expectation. </p><p>She rejects such low-minded analysis of her certainty. No; there was no </p><p>reason why she should expect a letter this morning more than any other; </p><p>but so it was - and it was the same ones before, when the dish-cover fell </p><p>and got bruised; she had said at breakfast something would happen that </p><p>day, she knew. But as to your certainties, for which you allege arguments, </p><p>the same Maria considers them offensive, unless they are to be overcome </p><p>by her assertion. If you will not believe that a looking-glass is cloudy and </p><p>spotty in spite of daily, diligent rubbing, or that the steel of all your </p><p>variously procured stoves happens to be of so peculiar a quality that it will </p><p>not "take" a polish, she thinks she has a right to feel offended. If, how- </p><p>ever, she happens to be in a good humour, she will perhaps observe, apropos </p><p>of the steel, that at one place where she lived there was a bright fender </p><p>with a sharp edge, and the nurse let the child fall on it and cut itself; and </p><p>when she has given you all the circumstances attendant on this event, the </p><p>name of the doctor who was called in and what he said, she will feel that </p><p>she has readjusted her position as a polisher of stoves. </p><p>On the whole, servants are little disposed to think that the opinions of </p><p>gentlefolks can have any practical value for them. Our remedies, our </p><p>methods, our explanations, are like the drapery and tailoring we pay so </p><p>much for; they correspond to the supposed scale of our income; but </p><p>servants, for their part, get their stuffs and their views from other quarters. </p><p>The cure for a gentleman's toothache is not likely to suit Sally's molar so </p><p>well as the cure recommended by the grocer's boy on the authority of his </p><p>first cousin, who went about with a blue handkerchief round his head for </p><p>weeks and weeks. And for the probabilities concerning the dryness of the </p><p>coming summer, or the guilt of the man last taken up for murder, the </p><p>person to be consulted with the most deference is the laundress who serves </p><p>very good families, and whose husband is in the carrying line. </p><p>The moral of all this is, that wise masters and mistresses will not </p><p>argue with their servants, will not give them reasons, will not con- </p><p>sult them. A mild yet firm authority which rigorously demands </p><p>that certain things be done, without urging motives or entering </p><p>into explanations, is both preferred by the servants themselves, and </p><p>is the best means of educating them into any improvement of </p><p>their methods and habits. Authority and tradition are the chief, </p><p>almost the only safe guides of the uninstructed - are the chief </p><p>means of developing the crude mind, whether childish or adult. Reason </p><p>about everything with your child, you make him a monster, without </p><p>reverence, without affections. Reason about things with your servants, </p><p>consult them, give them the suffrage; and you produce no other effect in </p><p>them than a sense of anarchy in the house, a suspicion of irresoluteness in </p><p>you, the most opposed to that spirit of order and promptitude which </p><p>can alone enable them to fill their places well and make their lives </p><p>respectable. </p><p>FUTILE FALSEHOODS. </p><p>To the EDITOR of the PALL MALL GAZETTE. </p><p>SIR,—I have been so much edified by the letters of your correspondents that I venture with some diffidence to add myself to their number. I am disposed to regard you as a shadowy, powerful, and beneficent personage, like the Spectator of old; to whom somehow or other it will be of use to complain of oppressive social customs and even domestic grievances, since you can distil helpful wisdom through your pages, teaching us how to endure our griefs, or (what would be more satisfactory) teaching those who grieve us to be ashamed of themselves. I may as well confess at once that I am a woman, and have not the pen of a ready writer; I have often to think for a long while what I shall say next, and then to think whether it is worth saying, which I suppose never happens to those who have been taught composition. But I have read in the Saturday Review, which I hold to be the greatest authority on such matters, since it knows not only what people have done, but also what they will be able to do to the end of their lives that women often succeed in writing letters even better than men. Indeed, anyone may see that there are some things which must needs be best done by small creatures, and there is nothing so clever at nibbling as a mouse.</p><p>What I want to complain of, Mr. Editor, is the provoking confidence people seem to have in each other's stupidity.  I find them seeing through their neighbours' little attempts at deception with great ease. They never take an old man for a young one: his wadding does not pass with them for muscle, or his hair-dye for the vigour of youth, and however the pitiable old creature may twiddle his cane, they can see that his hoots pinch him. They are not in the least disposed to take an elderly gentleman for a young one because he wishes it. Why, then, when they see so clearly through the small tricks, and shams, and affectations of others, and are so far from being swayed in their opinions by the wishes of others, do they nevertheless go on using small tricks, and shams, and affectations of their own, and imagine that these are believed in as something genuine? Cinderella, whom I am really rather fond of, for I admire her little feet very much, and she is kind when she sees me looking ill, indulges herself in giving me long confidences about her heart affairs and other feminine matters, such as the foibles of her acquaintances, which, by the air of exaggeration they carry on the very face of them, as well as by a comparison my memory enables me to make of her different versions, I am convinced cannot be more than half true. It is not to be supposed that she would go on telling me these things if she thought that she thereby made me believe in nothing more than the untrustworthiness of her narratives; yet I observe that Cinderella is rather sharp in detecting the petty mendacity of her acquaintances, and not unfrequently uses such phrases as "He or she says so; but we are not bound to believe it." If I had not noticed that she is quite as free and inventive in her talk to her other friends, I should have concluded that she relied on my exceptional dulness and simplicity, for I gather from many indications that I impress my fellow-creatures as not being particularly bright.</p><p>Now, Mr. Editor, I do not pretend to be witty—I suppose that would be a pretence more futile than hair-dye; I am not conscious of presenting in my own person any cheering prophetic glimpses of woman's great achievements in the future; but, Sir, I am not slow at accounts. I know my addition table and multiplication table well, and I argue in this way: Would any one who gave me credit for knowing my tables imagine that he could persuade me into anything he pleased, by gomg on the supposition that nine and six make twelve, and that three times eight are twenty? Yet I am constantly talked to more or less smilingly by various classes of people, with the evident expectation that I shall be swayed by suppositions hardly less monstrous. For some time I was disposed to be rebellious against Providence, which seemed to have made me look much sillier than I am, till I had satisfied myself that many persons who have an average air of common sense are subjected to precisely the same treatment as myself. To go no farther than the shopmen. One would not say that they are a class who hold that a generous spirit of self-sacrifice, a burning zeal for the good of man as man, was quite an ordinary motive to action, easily credible as the ruling impulse of any personage in a well-starched collar and wristbands. Yet I hardly ever enter even the most fashionable shops without hearing something which implies an expectation on the part of the speaker that I shall believe he loves me better than he loves himself. He brings out a piece of stuff which I see is of a somewhat peculiar colour, and perhaps not highly saleable; he assures me that the firm have had a special order for this colour from the Russian Court; that it ought to be charged two shillings per yard more than the other pieces (which are of colours favoured by the public); but that, since it is not yet marked, he will let me have it—not for the same price as the others, which would already have been generous—but for a shilling a yard less! On hearing this I reflected that my crinoline was not large; that my dress did not sweep the ground; that altogether, to a draper, I must seem a pitiable object.</p><p>But immediately there swept into the shop another lady, of the most commanding presence, who swept down a pole and two pieces of alpaca on her passage. I was all ear to observe whether she, too, would be expected to believe in the eager self-renunciation of drapers. No; but she was expected to believe the draper's assertion rather than her own senses, and when she proved intractable on this point she was expected to change her wants in a moment at his suggestion. She said a certain mauve ribbon was of too red a tone. "No, ma'am, we do not call this a red tone." She persisted that it was too red to suit her purpose. "The reddish mauves are all the fashion, ma'am; in fact, we have not "provided ourselves with the bluer shades, because they are not being "asked for." Thus, in spite of her irreproachable costume, this lady was expected to believe that red was not red, and to be so sure that a salesman had no motive for saying this save the desire that she should make a purchase satisfactory to herself, that she would rather believe herself suddenly afflicted with colour-blindness than doubt his statement. </p><p>I confess, Sir, when I have recovered from my angry humiliation at being talked to in this strain, the mental state of these fellow-creatures behind the drapers' counters is a source of melancholy to me. That this stupid mendacity, this palpable lying, this almost idiotic reliance on the nullity of the human understanding, should be an outgrowth of our civilization, affects me much more than any missionary accounts of the poor heathens who worship shapeless idols. And as I have heard that the heads of these firms whose salesmen are such distressing specimens of the modern Christian, are often gentlemen of considerable culture, doubtless contributing to philanthropic schemes, I have wondered whether they could not add to the benefit they confer on society by investing their capital in linens, silks, and woollens, the further benefit of assembling their shopmen weekly and endeavouring to guide them into some method of serving their customers which would be less vitiating to themselves and really more likely to attain a profitable result. These salesmen have the advantage of knowing their arithmetical tables: could they not be made to understand, for example, that to love one's neighbour more than oneself transcends the spirit even of the law and the prophets, and is generally known not to be the spirit of the drapery trade? and that to urge such preposterous pretences on their customers is nearly equivalent to telling them that five and four make </p><p>ten? </p><p>I know there is a great deal of successful falsehood in the world, but then it is clever falsehood, and must be sustained by rare natural gifts. I leave that deep evil to deep thinkers. The nuisance I complain of is the futile falsity which reduces a great deal of one's intercourse with one's fellows to a simpering acquiescence that covers an inward disbelief, and runs through society like this nipping north-east wind, chilling our kindly feelings, checking our respect, and encouraging a self-defensive, resistent attitude towards neighbours who are in the main estimable. Why will Placidia, who, I know, has many virtues, try to persuade me before she asks a favour that the interval of a year which has elapsed since her last visit to me has been a subject of much regret to her, and has been entirely due to the distance between her residence and mine—a distance which has been so easily surmounted on the present occasion? I am quite willing to do her a service without believing that my society has great charms for her; and even if I were not, it is really unfair to my small understanding for her to suppose that if I had been offended by her absence I should be propitiated by so transparent an excuse. And why will the handsome Autumna, whom I would rather look at than at many more youthful beauties, use little parenthetic devices to persuade me that she is no more than forty, when a little reflection might convince her that I am in possession of probabilities which must outweigh her testimony on this personal matter?</p><p>Not, Sir, that I would sit in judgment on my neighbours as being better than they. It is true I was taught Dr. WATIS' hymns in my childhood, and made to feel it a burning disgrace to be detected even in a small untruth; but I have sometimes sinned in spite of that knowledge. I would willingly be thought more highly of than I deserve, and if I were not of a desponding nature I should perhaps be seduced into many little tricks and devices which I should flatter myself were likely to produce a pleasing impression. But whenever I attempt anything of this kind I have bad dreams after it and awake with the suspicion that I have cut rather a ridiculous figure. And these failures of mine have made me more alive to the unconscious failures of the same sort that I see going on around me. Surely energy could hardly be more utterly wasted than on falsehoods which deceive nobody. My husband, who is a great mathematician, has calculated that that the nervous energy thus wasted during morning calls within the western districts of London alone would be enough to lift off the dome of St. Paul's and deposit it as a cap on Helvellyn. I do not think this would be a very useful diversion of nervous expenditure, but it would have the negative advantage of making morning calls less oppressive.—I remain, Sir, your humble and admiring reader, </p><p>SACHARISSA. </p><p>MODERN HOUSEKEEPING. </p><p>To the EDITOR of the PALL MALL GAZETTE. </p><p>Sir,--It is perhaps well that I am not a woman of much leisure, for since you were so obliging as to print my former letter, I have thought of so many grievances which I should like to complain of, that if there had not been some still stronger check on my pen than my slowness in composition, you might have begun to find me troublesome. I hear my husband say that the writers of the present day lack matter, and that the ancients have robbed them. I am sure, Mr. Editor, I should be glad if the ancients had robbed me of the matter which sets me writing. I should desire nothing better than that the serious disagreeables of these times had been discussed and fairly done with two thousand years ago; and I cannot help thinking that, compared with us, the ancients had an easy life of it. For they had not discovered America,  cotton had not risen to its present frightful price, carrying other prices with it, and, as I understand, it was comparatively few of the ancients who had to make a show, whereas every modem is expected to do it.</p><p>You already guess my grievance, Mr. Editor. It is the difficulty of making both ends meet, with every payment increasing except the payment one is receiving as income. I do not mind telling you that we have only  800 a year, that we have four children (two boys to be educated, and two girls to be dressed), and that, as my husbands spare time is entirely occupied in writing books for private circulation, with the motto "Fit audience, though few," enclosed in an elegant cipher on the title-page, it is not likely that we shall ever have more money at our command than at present. Now, Sir, I am proud of my husband. It is true he sometimes irritates me by calling me loquacious, when the only reason he can show is that all women are so by nature, which seems to me no proof at all that I am loquacious, who sit with my mouth buttoned up for hours together while he is talking to his learned friends. Of course talk gathers inside one a little in those long silences, and, when a chance of speaking comes, the words hurry out all the faster, especially as there is no knowing when another chance may come; but I call this reason, and not loquacity.</p><p>However, as I was saying, my husband is the best of men; and I like to think that he will be read by posterity; and I should be quite contented with our moderate income, if it would not seem to shrink, as it does, every year, because everything we measure it by gets larger. I know there are the gold-fields, and the spread of commerce, and the demand for labour, and the increase of the national wealth, and that everything is explained in the books on Political Economy; and really, Sir, to hear some people talk, one would think that explanation was as good as a dinner, and I dare say it may be to some gentlemen of very hungry minds, whose clothes do not cost much. But if they like explaining, I wish they would explain to me how people with fixed incomes are to go on living respectably when the prices are always rising, and the fashions for ever changing and getting more foolish and expensive. Will there always be fixed incomes? or is the discovery of gutta-percha a ground for hoping that everything will be made elastic, and that all salaries, and annuities, and dividends will stretch to fit the prices and the fashions? If not, my only hope is that the Empress of the FRENCH may adopt the costume of a Sister of Charity, and that the Princess of WALES may become a Quakeress. I am sure I would wish well to any religion that wanted less silk for a skirt, and fewer small things from the mercers' shops. </p><p>For consider, Mr. Editor, our boys cost us  200 a year; then there is what my husband pays to his publisher, and there are his cigars, and his subscriptions--he has no indulgences except smoking and writing, and explaining everything, and something must be allowed for pleasure out of-every income. I am sure my dress, and the girls', is not much of a pleasure, nor the parties that we must have white gloves and flys for; still less the parties we must have at home in return. These things may be very well for people who need not think of the expense; but do what I will, these items I have mentioned never stop at the middle of the fourth hundred, and it is easy to see (remembering the price of meat and grocery) that when rent and taxes and wages have been paid, we have barely enough left for our ordinary housekeeping; and as for giving anything away--the most helpful explanation I ever heard of from political economy is, that charity does harm.</p><p>Well, all this difficulty of living comfortably on an income that used to be thought ample for people of the middle class comes, I am told, from the action of necessary laws, which it is ridiculous to quarrel with, and if I say anything to the contrary. I am checked by being reminded that I am a woman, and must not expect to understand these things. (My husband leaves the accounts to me, else, ridiculous or not, I think there would be some quarrelling with the necessary laws.) But, Sir, since you have not checked me in letter-writing, what I want to know is, whether extravagant fashions, and habits out of keeping with one's station, are necessary laws. I say nothing about champagne. And whether the world is made on such a plan that people who cannot afford good sherry and claret must now-a-days, whether they like it or not, make matters worse by giving poor champagne at their tables. We do not consume a great deal of champagne at home; but nothing would help me more in making both ends meet, or save me more worry and labour, than a lightening of the demands for dress. And is it, pray, a necessary law--is it independent of everybody's will in the world, or the necessary action of everybody's will--that a woman's gown should drag at the very least half a yard on the ground, or else that it should be looped-up over a crinoline so as to make it indispensable that her underclothmg should be expensively ornamental? My girls are not very silly, but they require expenence to see that though every other young lady has an embroidered petticoat and muslin-work and stiped stockings, besides a dress that drags like peacock's tail when it is let down, their own liver might be endurable without such things. There is no hiding from them the fact that the backs of dresses shorter than the fashion are stared at by their own sex with more contempt than a long train of silk or poplin that is filled with dust.</p><p>It will not do for a mother to argue too much with her girls, and one cannot bring up one's daughters in sensible way when the habits of all their acquaintances are foolish. Writing good maxims in copy-books and reading the lives of Mrs. FRY and the Mere ANGELIQUE will not reconcile a girl to looking queer in the eyes of companions and passers-by. In my own youth it was thought disgraceful for a woman to have dust about her person, and she was under no temptation to buy several extra yards of silk for the sake of spoiling them immediately. But now I see women, who otherwise have an air of respectability, raising a cloud of dust behind them as they walk, and seeming not to mind that their handsome moire or grenadine is as full of dust as the sides of an emptied flour-bag are full of flour. I suppose every one knows that these elegant ladies have not all of them maids specially to attend to their dress, and even if they had, no amount of brushing could make their trailed dresses look quite clean again. </p><p>A lady's wardrobe used to be all lavender and purity; and my mother had silk dresses of her grandmother's so free from stain that they were made into best frocks for me. I wonder what is the state of these ladies' wardrobes whose dresses sweep the streets. My girls fasten up their dresses when they walk abroad, but that does not prevent the expense of having long skirts indoors. And of course the poor things like to go to dances as well as to other parties; naturally, they want pleasures suited to their age. Their father has his cigars and his explanations, and I am broad and clumsy now, and must not, in these difficult times, look for more pleasure than keeping the bills within compass, and seeing the children enjoy themselves and do well. But, as I said, the girls must go to dances; and it will not do now for them to have a simple muslin dress of moderate length, which may be washed and worn again and again. They would feel that they were tittered at as bread-and-butter Misses. They must have a certain style about them: a bunch of costly flowers in the front of the head and a bunch at the back; a large transparent skirt with bows and furbelows over a silk petticoat--what my husband calls a dress of a great volume (but I am sure the largest volume he ever wrote has never paid for such a dress); then ear-rings, lace tuckers, bracelets, the finest French gloves, gossamer pocket-handkerchiefs, and delicate fans, to say nothing of shoes and stockings--and certainly their feet are very pretty and my girls when they are dressed in this way do not look like some others who seem to have stuck twenty pounds' worth of finery about them on purpose to expose their face and figure, which are GOD's handiwork, to all men's ridicule. Look at their features, Mr. Editor, and you may see their CREATOR never meant them to have three large pink roses set on the top of them. </p><p>Yes, my girls look pretty: but O! Sir, their mother has to suffer for it; for there are the dressmakers' bills; and what does my giving up sugar signify? It will not pay even for hooks and eyes. My girls cannot make their own dresses; their time for sewing is taken up with muslin work for their underclothing, which they must otherwise pay an outrageous price for. And the way the dressmakers' and milliners' bills mount up, :in spite of all my contrivance, and my turning over gimp trimmings, and satin ruches,and Maltese lace in my mind from morning till night, and in the dead of night too, and when the birds begin to sing as if this was not a world of gimp and satin! If this is national wealth, I wish I had lived a little earlier, so as to see only the time of national  poverty, when people had pleasure in taking care and saving, that they might feel they had enouugh, and could get fond of the few things they wore and  used, because they lasted a long while. To be sure, I have plenty of saving and taking care, but it is all for extravagance; it never makes me feel we have enough. And my children never get fond of their things, for nothing lasts long, or if it does it gets old-fashioned, and they are ashamed of it. I am afraid this sort of feeling may go deeper than sleeves and sashes, and that this genertion may be unlearning some good feelings that used to make people tender to the old and uncomely, out of memory and faithful affection. If one has to think so very much of gawdy stuffs and new patterns, it stands to reason there can be little time for thinking about other things which will not be crushed up in the rag-bag when next year comes.</p><p>Perhaps you will say, Why, then, if you are a sensible woman, do you go on doing what you know is objectionable? But O! Sir, society is "too many" for me. It is not likely that a stout woman, who is no!hmg particular in any way, and whose daughters have grown up with a will of their own, can make the world bend to her notions. Besides, if these things are "necessary laws?" Perhaps the spread of commerce will cause shrouds to be over-trimmed before long. And yet there are a great many of our fellow-countrymen whose wives and daughters have not only no trimmings, but no proper dinner. These questions are always tangling themselves with gimps, and gauzes, and prices, and weekly bills, till I am fit to subscribe myself nothing else than </p><p>	Your puzzled correspondent,</p><p>		SACCHARISSA.</p><p>THE GRAMMAR OF ORNAMENT. </p><p>By OWEN JONES, Architect. Illustrated by Examples from various Styles of Ornament. 112 Plates. Day and Son, London. </p><p>THE inventor of movable types, says the venerable Teufelsdrockh, was disbanding hired armies, cashiering most kings and senates, and creating a whole new democratic world. Has any one yet said what great things are being done by the men who are trying to banish ugliness from our streets and our homes, and to make both the outside and inside of our dwellings worthy of a world where there are forests, and flower-tressed meadows, and the plumage of birds; where the insects carry lessons of colour on their wings, and even the surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders of iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage? They, too, are modifying opinions, for they are modifying men's moods and habits, which are the mothers of opinions, having quite as much to do with their formation as the responsible father--Reason. Think of certain hideous manufacturing towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious perdition, and the pleasure is chiefly gin. The dingy surface of wall pierced by the ugliest windows, the staring shop-fronts, paper-hangings, carpets, brass and gilt mouldings, and advertising placards, have an effect akin to that of malaria; it is easy to understand that with such surroundings there is more belief in cruelty than in beneficence, and that the best earthly bliss attainable is the dulling of the external senses. For it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is taken for beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty; the subtle relation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life forbids that bad </p><p>taste should ever be harmless to our moral sensibility or our intellectual discernment; and--more than that--as it is probable that fine musical harmonies have a sanative influence over our bodily organisation, it is also probable that just colouring and lovely combinations of lines may be necessary to the complete well-being of our systems apart from any conscious delight in them. A savage may indulge in discordant chuckles and shrieks and gutturals, and think that they please the gods, but it does not follow that his frame would not be favourably wrought upon by the vibrations of a grand church organ. One sees a person capable of choosing the worst style of wall-paper become suddenly afflicted by its ugliness under an attack of illness. And if an evil state of blood and lymph usually goes along with an evil state of mind, who shall say that the ugliness of our streets, the falsity of our ornamentation, the vulgarity of our upholstery, have not something to do with those bad tempers which breed false conclusions?</p><p>On several grounds it is possible to make a more speedy and extensive application of artistic reform to our interior decoration than to our external architecture. One of these grounds is that most of our ugly buildings must stand; we cannot afford to pull them down. But every year we are decorating interiors afresh, and people of modest means may benefit by the introduction of beautiful designs into stucco ornaments, paper-hangings, draperies, and carpets. Fine taste in the decoration of interiors is a benefit that spreads from the palace to the clerk's house with one parlour. </p><p>All honour, then, to the architect who has zealously vindicated the claim of internal ornamentation to be a part of the architect's function, and has laboured to rescue that form of art which is most closely connected with the sanctities and pleasures of our hearths from the hands of uncultured tradesmen. All the </p><p>NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 125 </p><p>nation ought at present to know that this effort is peculiarly associated with the name of Mr. Owen Jones; and those who are most disposed to dispute with the architect about his colouring, must at least recognise the high artistic principle which has directed his attention to coloured ornamentation as a proper branch of architecture. One monument of his effort in this way is his "Grammar of Ornament," of which a new and cheaper edition has just been issued. The one point in which it differs from the original and more expensive edition, viz., the reduction in the size of the pages (the amount of matter and number of plates are unaltered), is really an advantage; it is now a very manageable folio, and when the reader is in a lounging mood may be held easily on the knees. It is a magnificent book; and those who know no more of it than the title, should be told that they will find in it a pictorial history of ornamental design, from its rudimentary condition as seen in the productions of savage tribes, through all the other great types of art--the Egyptian, Assyrian, ancient Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arabian, Moresque, Mahommedan-Persian, Indian, Celtic, Mediaeval, Renaissance, Elizabethan, and Italian. The letter-press consists, first, of an introductory statement of fundamental principles of ornamentation--principles, says the author, which will be found to have been obeyed more or less instinctively by all nations in proportion as their art has been a genuine product of the national genius; and, secondly, of brief historical essays, some of them contributed by other eminent artists, presenting a commentary on each characteristic series of illustrations, with the useful appendage of bibliographical lists. </p><p>The title "Grammar of Ornament" is so far appropriate that it indicates what Mr. Owen Jones is most anxious to be understood concerning the object of his work, namely, that it is intended to illustrate historically the application of principles, and not to present a collection of models for mere copyists. The plates correspond to examples in syntax, not to be repeated parrot-like, but to be studied as embodiments of syntactical principles. There is a logic of form which cannot be departed from in ornamental design without a corresponding remoteness from perfection; unmeaning, irrelevant lines are as bad as irrelevant words or clauses, that tend no whither. And as a suggestion towards the origination of fresh ornamental design, the work concludes with some beautiful drawings of leaves and flowers from nature, that the student, tracing in them the simple laws of form which underlie an immense variety in beauty, may the better discern the method by which the same laws were applied in the finest decorative work of the past, and may have all the clearer prospect of the unexhausted possibilities of freshness which lie before him, if, refraining from mere imitation, he will seek only such likeness to existing forms of ornamental art as arises from following like principles of combination.</p><p>GEORGE ELIOT. </p><p>SOME ACCOUNT OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN. By G. E. STREET. With Woodcuts. John Murray, London. 1865. </p><p>THIS very handsome volume is, it may be hoped, only an instalment of what architectural Spain will yield if Mr. Street and other similarly qualified explorers are encouraged to draw and measure in the great Peninsula. The raison d'etre for such a publication, and the spirit in which Mr. Street has undertaken it, may be judged from a few words in his preface. After summing up the labour o this predecessors, he says:-- </p><p>"Seeing how complete is the ignorance which up to the present time we have laboured under, as to the true history and nature of Gothic architecture in Spain, I commit this volume to the reader with a fair trust that what has been the </p><p>THE INFLUENCE OF RATIONALISM. </p><p>There is a valuable class of books on great subjects which have something of the character and functions of good popular lecturing. They are not original, not subtle, not of close logical texture, not exquisite either in thought or style; but by virtue of these negatives they are all the more fit to act on the average intelligence. They have enough of organizing purpose in them to make their facts illustrative, and to leave a distinct result in the mind even when most of the facts are forgotten; and they have enough of vagueness and vacillation in their theory to win them ready acceptance from a mixed audience. The vagueness and vacillation are not devices of timidity; they are the honest result of the writer’s own mental character, which adapts him to be the instructor and the favorite of “the general reader.” For the most part, the general reader of the present day does not exactly know what distance he goes; he only knows that he does not go “too far.” Of any remarkable thinker, whose writings have excited controversy, he likes to have it said that “his errors are to be deplored,” leaving it not too certain what those errors are; he is fond of what may be called disembodied opinions, that float in vapory phrases above all systems of thought or action; he likes an undefined Christianity which opposes itself to nothing in particular, an undefined education of the people, an undefined amelioration of all things: in fact, he likes sound views—nothing extreme, but something between the excesses of the past and the excesses of the present. This modern type of the general reader may be known in conversation by the cordiality with which he assents to indistinct, blurred statements: say that black is black, he will shake his head and hardly think it; say that black is not so very black, he will reply, “Exactly.” He has no hesitation, if you wish it, even to get up at a public meeting and express his conviction that at times, and within certain limits, the radii of a circle have a tendency to be equal; but, on the other hand, he would urge that the spirit of geometry may be carried a little too far. His only bigotry is a bigotry against any clearly defined opinion; not in the least based on a scientific scepticism, but belonging to a lack of coherent thought—a spongy texture of mind, that gravitates strongly to nothing. The one thing he is staunch for is, the utmost liberty of private haziness. </p><p>But precisely these characteristics of the general reader, rendering him incapable of assimilating ideas unless they are administered in a highly diluted form, make it a matter of rejoicing that there are clever, fair-minded men, who will write books for him—men very much above him in knowledge and ability, but not too remote from him in their habits of thinking, and who can thus prepare for him infusions of history and science that will leave some solidifying deposit, and save him from a fatal softening of the intellectual skeleton. Among such serviceable writers, Mr. Lecky’s “History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe” entitles him to a high place. He has prepared himself for its production by an unusual amount of well-directed reading; he has chosen his facts and quotations with much judgment; and he gives proof of those important moral qualifications, impartiality, seriousness, and modesty. This praise is chiefly applicable to the long chapter on the history of Magic and Witchcraft, which opens the work, and to the two chapters on the antecedents and history of Persecution, which occur, the one at the end of the first volume, the other at the beginning of the second. In these chapters Mr. Lecky has a narrower and better-traced path before him than in other portions of his work; he is more occupied with presenting a particular class of facts in their historical sequence, and in their relation to certain grand tide-marks of opinion, than with disquisition; and his writing is freer than elsewhere from an apparent confusedness of thought and an exuberance of approximative phrases, which can be serviceable in no other way than as diluents needful for the sort of reader we have just described.</p><p>The history of magic and witchcraft has been judiciously chosen by Mr. Lecky as the subject of his first section on the Declining Sense of the Miraculous, because it is strikingly illustrative of a position with the truth of which he is strongly impressed, though he does not always treat of it with desirable clearness and precision, namely, that certain beliefs become obsolete, not in consequence of direct arguments against them, but because of their incongruity with prevalent habits of thought. Here is his statement of the two “classes of influences” by which the mass of men, in what is called civilized society, get their beliefs gradually modified: </p><p>“If we ask why it is that the world has rejected what was once so universally and so intensely believed, why a narrative of an old woman who had been seen riding on a broomstick, or who was proved to have transformed herself into a wolf, and to have devoured the flocks of her neighbors, is deemed so entirely incredible, most persons would probably be unable to give a very definite answer to the question. It is not because we have examined the evidence and found it insufficient, for the disbelief always precedes, when it does not prevent, examination. It is rather because the idea of absurdity is so strongly attached to such narratives, that it is difficult even to consider them with gravity. Yet at one time no such improbability was felt, and hundreds of persons have been burnt simply on the two grounds I have mentioned. </p><p>“When so complete a change takes place in public opinion, it may be ascribed to one or other of two causes. It may be the result of a controversy which has conclusively settled the question, establishing to the satisfaction of all parties a clear preponderance of argument or fact in favor of one opinion, and making that opinion a truism which is accepted by all enlightened men, even though they have not themselves examined the evidence on which it rests. Thus, if any one in a company of ordinarily educated persons were to deny the motion of the earth, or the circulation of the blood, his statement would be received with derision, though it is probable that some of his audience would be unable to demonstrate the first truth, and that very few of them could give sufficient reasons for the second. They may not themselves be able to defend their position; but they are aware that, at certain known periods of history, controversies on those subjects took place, and that known writers then brought forward some definite arguments or experiments, which were ultimately accepted by the whole learned world as rigid and conclusive demonstrations. It is possible, also, for as complete a change to be effected by what is called the spirit of the age. The general intellectual tendencies pervading the literature of a century profoundly modify the character of the public mind. They form a new tone and habit of thought. They alter the measure of probability. They create new attractions and new antipathies, and they eventually cause as absolute a rejection of certain old opinions as could be produced by the most cogent and definite arguments.”</p><p>Mr. Lecky proceeds to some questionable views concerning the evidences of witchcraft, which seem to be irreconcilable even with his own remarks later on; but they lead him to the statement, thoroughly made out by his historical survey, that “movement was mainly silent, unargumentative, and insensible; that men came gradually to disbelieve in witchcraft, because they came gradually to look upon it as absurd; and that this new tone of thought appeared, first of all, in those who were least subject to theological influences, and soon spread through the educated laity, and, last of all, took possession of the clergy.” </p><p>We have rather painful proof that this “second class of influences,” with a vast number go hardly deeper than Fashion, and that witchcraft to many of us is absurd only on the same ground that our grandfathers’ gigs are absurd. It is felt preposterous to think of spiritual agencies in connection with ragged beldames soaring on broomsticks, in an age when it is known that mediums of communication with the invisible world are usually unctuous personages dressed in excellent broadcloth, who soar above the curtain-poles without any broomstick, and who are not given to unprofitable intrigues. The enlightened imagination rejects the figure of a witch with her profile in dark relief against the moon and her broomstick cutting a constellation. No undiscovered natural laws, no names of “respectable” witnesses, are invoked to make us feel our presumption in questioning the diabolic intimacies of that obsolete old woman, for it is known now that the undiscovered laws, and the witnesses qualified by the payment of income tax, are all in favor of a different conception—the image of a heavy gentleman in boots and black coat-tails foreshortened against the cornice. Yet no less a person than Sir Thomas Browne once wrote that those who denied there were witches, inasmuch as they thereby denied spirits also, were “obliquely and upon consequence a sort, not of infidels, but of atheists.” At present, doubtless, in certain circles, unbelievers in heavy gentlemen who float in the air by means of undiscovered laws are also taxed with atheism; illiberal as it is not to admit that mere weakness of understanding may prevent one from seeing how that phenomenon is necessarily involved in the Divine origin of things. With still more remarkable parallelism, Sir Thomas Browne goes on: “Those that, to refute their incredulity, desire to see apparitions, shall questionless never behold any, nor have the power to be so much as witches. The devil hath made them already in a heresy as capital as witchcraft, and to appear to them were but to convert them.” It would be difficult to see what has been changed here, but the mere drapery of circumstance, if it were not for this prominent difference between our own days and the days of witchcraft, that instead of torturing, drowning, or burning the innocent, we give hospitality and large pay to—the highly distinguished medium. At least we are safely rid of certain horrors; but if the multitude—that “farraginous concurrence of all conditions, tempers, sexes, and ages”—do not roll back even to a superstition that carries cruelty in its train, it is not because they possess a cultivated reason, but because they are pressed upon and held up by what we may call an external reason—the sum of conditions resulting from the laws of material growth, from changes produced by great historical collisions shattering the structures of ages and making new highways for events and ideas, and from the activities of higher minds no longer existing merely as opinions and teaching, but as institutions and organizations with which the interests, the affections, and the habits of the multitude are inextricably interwoven. No undiscovered laws accounting for small phenomena going forward under drawing-room tables are likely to affect the tremendous facts of the increase of population, the rejection of convicts by our colonies, the exhaustion of the soil by cotton plantations, which urge even upon the foolish certain questions, certain claims, certain views concerning the scheme of the world, that can never again be silenced. If right reason is a right representation of the co-existence and sequences of things, here are co-existences and sequences that do not wait to be discovered, but press themselves upon us like bars of iron. No séances at a guinea a head for the sake of being pinched by “Mary Jane” can annihilate railways, steamships, and electric telegraphs, which are demonstrating the interdependence of all human interests, and making self-interest a duct for sympathy. These things are part of the external Reason to which internal silliness has inevitably to accommodate itself.</p><p>Three points in the history of magic and witchcraft are well brought out by Mr. Lecky. First, that the cruelties connected with it did not begin until men’s minds had ceased to repose implicitly in a sacramental system which made them feel well armed against evil spirits; that is, until the eleventh century, when there came a sort of morning dream of doubt and heresy, bringing on the one side the terror of timid consciences, and on the other the terrorism of authority or zeal bent on checking the rising struggle. In that time of comparative mental repose, says Mr. Lecky, </p><p>“All those conceptions of diabolical presence; all that predisposition toward the miraculous, which acted so fearfully upon the imaginations of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, existed; but the implicit faith, the boundless and triumphant credulity with which the virtue of ecclesiastical rites was accepted, rendered them comparatively innocuous. If men had been a little less superstitious, the effects of their superstition would have been much more terrible. It was firmly believed that any one who deviated from the strict line of orthodoxy must soon succumb beneath the power of Satan; but as there was no spirit of rebellion or doubt, this persuasion did not produce any extraordinary terrorism.” </p><p>The Church was disposed to confound heretical opinion with sorcery; false doctrine was especially the devil’s work, and it was a ready conclusion that a denier or innovator had held consultation with the father of lies. It is a saying of a zealous Catholic in the sixteenth century, quoted by Maury in his excellent work, “De la Magie”—“Crescit cum magia hæresis, cum hæresi magia.” Even those who doubted were terrified at their doubts, for trust is more easily undermined than terror. Fear is earlier born than hope, lays a stronger grasp on man’s system than any other passion, and remains master of a larger group of involuntary actions. A chief aspect of man’s moral development is the slow subduing of fear by the gradual growth of intelligence, and its suppression as a motive by the presence of impulses less animally selfish; so that in relation to invisible Power, fear at last ceases to exist, save in that interfusion with higher faculties which we call awe. </p><p>Secondly, Mr. Lecky shows clearly that dogmatic Protestantism, holding the vivid belief in Satanic agency to be an essential of piety, would have felt it shame to be a whit behind Catholicism in severity against the devil’s servants. Luther’s sentiment was that he would not suffer a witch to live (he was not much more merciful to Jews); and, in spite of his fondness for children, believing a certain child to have been begotten by the devil, he recommended the parents to throw it into the river. The torch must be turned on the worst errors of heroic minds—not in irreverent ingratitude, but for the sake of measuring our vast and various debt to all the influences which have concurred, in the intervening ages, to make us recognize as detestable errors the honest convictions of men who, in mere individual capacity and moral force, were very much above us. Again, the Scotch Puritans, during the comparatively short period of their ascendency, surpassed all Christians before them in the elaborate ingenuity of the tortures they applied for the discovery of witchcraft and sorcery, and did their utmost to prove that if Scotch Calvinism was the true religion, the chief “note” of the true religion was cruelty. It is hardly an endurable task to read the story of their doings; thoroughly to imagine them as a past reality is already a sort of torture. One detail is enough, and it is a comparatively mild one. It was the regular profession of men called “prickers” to thrust long pins into the body of a suspected witch in order to detect the insensible spot which was the infallible sign of her guilt. On a superficial view one would be in danger of saying that the main difference between the teachers who sanctioned these things and the much-despised ancestors who offered human victims inside a huge wicker idol, was that they arrived at a more elaborate barbarity by a longer series of dependent propositions. We do not share Mr. Buckle’s opinion that a Scotch minister’s groans were a part of his deliberate plan for keeping the people in a state of terrified subjection; the ministers themselves held the belief they taught, and might well groan over it. What a blessing has a little false logic been to the world! Seeing that men are so slow to question their premises, they must have made each other much more miserable, if pity had not sometimes drawn tender conclusions not warranted by Major and Minor; if there had not been people with an amiable imbecility of reasoning which enabled them at once to cling to hideous beliefs, and to be conscientiously inconsistent with them in their conduct. There is nothing like acute deductive reasoning for keeping a man in the dark: it might be called the technique of the intellect, and the concentration of the mind upon it corresponds to that predominance of technical skill in art which ends in degradation of the artist’s function, unless new inspiration and invention come to guide it.</p><p>And of this there is some good illustration furnished by that third node in the history of witchcraft, the beginning of its end, which is treated in an interesting manner by Mr. Lecky. It is worth noticing, that the most important defences of the belief in witchcraft, against the growing scepticism in the latter part of the sixteenth century and in the seventeenth, were the productions of men who in some departments were among the foremost thinkers of their time. One of them was Jean Bodin, the famous writer on government and jurisprudence, whose “Republic,” Hallam thinks, had an important influence in England, and furnished “a store of arguments and examples that were not lost on the thoughtful minds of our countrymen.” In some of his views he was original and bold; for example, he anticipated Montesquieu in attempting to appreciate the relations of government and climate. Hallam inclines to the opinion that he was a Jew, and attached Divine authority only to the Old Testament. But this was enough to furnish him with his chief data for the existence of witches and for their capital punishment; and in the account of his “Republic,” given by Hallam, there is enough evidence that the sagacity which often enabled him to make fine use of his learning was also often entangled in it, to temper our surprise at finding a writer on political science of whom it could be said that, along with Montesquieu, he was “the most philosophical of those who had read so deeply, the most learned of those who had thought so much,” in the van of the forlorn hope to maintain the reality of witchcraft. It should be said that he was equally confident of the unreality of the Copernican hypothesis, on the ground that it was contrary to the tenets of the theologians and philosophers and to common-sense, and therefore subversive of the foundations of every science. Of his work on witchcraft, Mr. Lecky says: </p><p>“The ‘Démonomanie des Sorciers’ is chiefly an appeal to authority, which the author deemed on this subject so unanimous and so conclusive, that it was scarcely possible for any sane man to resist it. He appealed to the popular belief in all countries, in all ages, and in all religions. He cited the opinions of an immense multitude of the greatest writers of pagan antiquity, and of the most illustrious of the Fathers. He showed how the laws of all nations recognized the existence of witchcraft; and he collected hundreds of cases which had been investigated before the tribunals of his own or of other countries. He relates with the most minute and circumstantial detail, and with the most unfaltering confidence, all the proceedings at the witches’ Sabbath, the methods which the witches employed in transporting themselves through the air, their transformations, their carnal intercourse with the devil, their various means of injuring their enemies, the signs that lead to their detection, their confessions when condemned, and their demeanor at the stake.”</p><p>Something must be allowed for a lawyer’s affection toward a belief which had furnished so many “cases.” Bodin’s work had been immediately prompted by the treatise “De Prestigiis Dænionum,” written by John Wier, a German physician, a treatise which is worth notice as an example of a transitional form of opinion for which many analogies may be found in the history both of religion and science. Wier believed in demons, and in possession by demons, but his practice as a physician had convinced him that the so-called witches were patients and victims, that the devil took advantage of their diseased condition to delude them, and that there was no consent of an evil will on the part of the women. He argued that the word in Leviticus translated “witch” meant “poisoner,” and besought the princes of Europe to hinder the further spilling of innocent blood. These heresies of Wier threw Bodin into such a state of amazed indignation that if he had been an ancient Jew instead of a modern economical one, he would have rent his garments. “No one had ever heard of pardon being accorded to sorcerers;” and probably the reason why Charles IX. died young was because he had pardoned the sorcerer, Trios Echelles! We must remember that this was in 1581, when the great scientific movement of the Renaissance had hardly begun—when Galileo was a youth of seventeen, and Kepler a boy of ten. </p><p>But directly afterward, on the other side, came Montaigne, whose sceptical acuteness could arrive at negatives without any apparatus of method. A certain keen narrowness of nature will secure a man from many absurd beliefs which the larger soul, vibrating to more manifold influences, would have a long struggle to part with. And so we find the charming, chatty Montaigne—in one of the brightest of his essays, “Des Boiteux,” where he declares that, from his own observation of witches and sorcerers, he should have recommended them to be treated with curative </p><p>hellebore—stating in his own way a pregnant doctrine, since taught more gravely. It seems to him much less of a prodigy that men should lie, or that their imaginations should deceive them, than that a human body should be carried through the air on a broomstick, or up a chimney by some unknown spirit. He thinks it a sad business to persuade oneself that the test of truth lies in the multitude of believers—“en une prosse où les fols surpassent de tant les sages en nombre.” Ordinarily, he has observed, when men have something stated to them as a fact, they are more ready to explain it than to inquire whether it is real: “ils passent pardessus les propositions, mais ils examinent les conséquences; ils laissent les choses, et courent aux causes.” There is a sort of strong and generous ignorance which is as honorable and courageous as science—“ignorance pour laquelle concevoir il n’y a pas moins de science qu’à concevoir la science.” And à propos of the immense traditional evidence which weighed with such men as Bodin, he says—“As for the proofs and arguments founded on experience and facts, I do not pretend to unravel these. What end of a thread is there to lay hold of? I often cut them as Alexander did his knot. Après tout, c’est mettre ses conjectures â bien haut prix, que d’en faire cuire un homme tout dif.” </p><p>Writing like this, when it finds eager readers, is a sign that the weather is changing; yet much later, namely, after 1665, when the Royal Society had been founded, our own Glanvil, the author of the “Scepsis Scientifica,” a work that was a remarkable advance toward the true definition of the limits of inquiry, and that won him his election as fellow of the society, published an energetic vindication of the belief in witchcraft, of which Mr. Lecky gives the following sketch: </p><p>“The ‘Sadducismus Triumphatus,’ which is probably the ablest book ever published in defence of the superstition, opens with a striking picture of the rapid progress of the scepticism in England. Everywhere, a disbelief in witchcraft was becoming fashionable in the upper classes; but it was a disbelief that arose entirely from a strong sense of its antecedent improbability. All who were opposed to the orthodox faith united in discrediting witchcraft. They laughed at it, as palpably absurd, as involving the most grotesque and ludicrous conceptions, as so essentially incredible that it would be a waste of time to examine it. This spirit had arisen since the Restoration, although the laws were still in force, and although little or no direct reasoning had been brought to bear upon the subject. In order to combat it, Glanvil proceeded to examine the general question of the credibility of the miraculous. He saw that the reason why witchcraft was ridiculed was, because it was a phase of the miraculous and the work of the devil; that the scepticism was chiefly due to those who disbelieved in miracles and the devil; and that the instances of witchcraft or possession in the Bible were invariably placed on a level with those that were tried in the law courts of England. That the evidence of the belief was overwhelming, he firmly believed; and this, indeed, was scarcely disputed; but, until the sense of à priori improbability was removed, no possible accumulation of facts would cause men to believe it. To that task he accordingly addressed himself. Anticipating the idea and almost the words of modern controversialists, he urged that there was such a thing as a credulity of unbelief; and that those who believed so strange a concurrence of delusions, as was necessary on the supposition of the unreality of witchcraft, were far more credulous than those who accepted the belief. He made his very scepticism his principal weapon; and, analyzing with much acuteness the à priori objections, he showed that they rested upon an unwarrantable confidence in our knowledge of the laws of the spirit world; that they implied the existence of some strict analogy between the faculties of men and of spirits; and that, as such analogy most probably did not exist, no reasoning based on the supposition could dispense men from examining the evidence. He concluded with a large collection of cases, the evidence of which was, as he thought, incontestable.”</p><p>We have quoted this sketch because Glanvil’s argument against the à priori objection of absurdity is fatiguingly urged in relation to other alleged marvels which, to busy people seriously occupied with the difficulties of affairs, of science, or of art, seem as little worthy of examination as aëronautic broomsticks. And also because we here see Glanvil, in combating an incredulity that does not happen to be his own, wielding that very argument of traditional evidence which he had made the subject of vigorous attack in his “Scepsis Scientifica.” But perhaps large minds have been peculiarly liable to this fluctuation concerning the sphere of tradition, because, while they have attacked its misapplications, they have been the more solicited by the vague sense that tradition is really the basis of our best life. Our sentiments may be called organized traditions; and a large part of our actions gather all their justification, all their attraction and aroma, from the memory of the life lived, of the actions done, before we were born. In the absence of any profound research into psychological functions or into the mysteries of inheritance, in the absence of any comprehensive view of man’s historical development and the dependence of one age on another, a mind at all rich in sensibilities must always have had an indefinite uneasiness in an undistinguishing attack on the coercive influence of tradition. And this may be the apology for the apparent inconsistency of Glanvil’s acute criticism on the one side, and his indignation at the “looser gentry,” who laughed at the evidences for witchcraft on the other. We have already taken up too much space with this subject of witchcraft, else we should be tempted to dwell on Sir Thomas Browne, who far surpassed Glanvil in magnificent incongruity of opinion, and whose works are the most remarkable combination existing, of witty sarcasm against ancient nonsense and modern obsequiousness, with indications of a capacious credulity. After all, we may be sharing what seems to us the hardness of these men, who sat in their studies and argued at their ease about a belief that would be reckoned to have caused more misery and bloodshed than any other superstition, if there had been no such thing as persecution on the ground of religious opinion.</p><p>On this subject of Persecution, Mr. Lecky writes his best: with clearness of conception, with calm justice, bent on appreciating the necessary tendency of ideas, and with an appropriateness of illustration that could be supplied only by extensive and intelligent reading. Persecution, he shows, is not in any sense peculiar to the Catholic Church; it is a direct sequence of the doctrines that salvation is to be had only within the Church, and that erroneous belief is damnatory—doctrines held as fully by Protestant sects as by the Catholics; and in proportion to its power, Protestantism has been as persecuting as Catholicism. He maintains, in opposition to the favorite modern notion of persecution defeating its own object, that the Church, holding the dogma of exclusive salvation, was perfectly consequent, and really achieved its end of spreading one belief and quenching another, by calling in the aid of the civil arm. Who will say that governments, by their power over institutions and patronage, as well as over punishment, have not power also over the interests and inclinations of men, and over most of those external conditions into which subjects are born, and which make them adopt the prevalent belief as a second nature? Hence, to a sincere believer in the doctrine of exclusive salvation, governments had it in their power to save men from perdition; and wherever the clergy were at the elbow of the civil arm, no matter whether they were Catholic or Protestant, persecution was the result. “Compel them to come in” was a rule that seemed sanctioned by mercy, and the horrible sufferings it led men to inflict seemed small to minds accustomed to contemplate, as a perpetual source of motive, the eternal unmitigated miseries of a hell that was the inevitable destination of a majority among mankind. </p><p>It is a significant fact, noted by Mr. Lecky, that the only two leaders of the Reformation who advocated tolerance were Zuinglius and Socinus, both of them disbelievers in exclusive salvation. And in corroboration of other evidence that the chief triumphs of the Reformation were due to coercion, he commends to the special attention of his readers the following quotation from a work attributed without question to the famous Protestant theologian, Jurieu, who had himself been hindered, as a Protestant, from exercising his professional functions in France, and was settled as pastor at Rotterdam. It should be remembered that Jurieu’s labors fell in the latter part of the seventeenth century and in the beginning of the eighteenth, and that he was the contemporary of Bayle, with whom he was in bitter controversial hostility. He wrote, then, at a time when there was warm debate on the question of Toleration; and it was his great object to vindicate himself and his French fellow-Protestants from all laxity on this point. </p><p>“Peut on nier que le panganisme est tombé dans le monde par l’autorité des empereurs Romains? On peut assurer sans temerité que le paganisme seroit encore debout, et que les trois quarts de l’Europe seroient encore payens si Constantin et ses successeurs n’avaient employé leur autorité pour l’abolir. Mais, je vous prie, de quelles voies Dieu s’est il servi dans ces derniers siècles pour rétablir la veritable religion dans l’Occident? Les rois de Suède, ceux de Danemarck, ceux d’Angleterre, les magistrats souverains de Suisse, des Païs Bas, des villes livres d’Allemagne, les princes électeurs, et autres princes souverains de l’empire, n’ont ils pas emploié leur autorité pour abbattre le Papisme?” </p><p>Indeed, wherever the tremendous alternative of everlasting torments is believed in—believed in so that it becomes a motive determining the life—not only persecution, but every other form of severity and gloom are the legitimate consequences. There is much ready declamation in these days against the spirit of asceticism and against zeal for doctrinal conversion; but surely the macerated form of a Saint Francis, the fierce denunciations of a Saint Dominic, the groans and prayerful wrestlings of the Puritan who seasoned his bread with tears and made all pleasurable </p><p>sensation sin, are more in keeping with the contemplation of unending anguish as the destiny of a vast multitude whose nature we share, than the rubicund cheerfulness of some modern divines, who profess to unite a smiling liberalism with a well-bred and tacit but unshaken confidence in the reality of the bottomless pit. But, in fact, as Mr. Lecky maintains, that awful image, with its group of associated dogmas concerning the inherited curse, and the damnation of unbaptized infants, of heathens, and of heretics, has passed away from what he is fond of calling “the realizations” of Christendom. These things are no longer the objects of practical belief. They may be mourned for in encyclical letters; bishops may regret them; doctors of divinity may sign testimonials to the excellent character of these decayed beliefs; but for the mass of Christians they are no more influential than unrepealed but forgotten statutes. And with these dogmas has melted away the strong basis for the defence of persecution. No man now writes eager vindications of himself and his colleagues from the suspicion of adhering to the principle of toleration. And this momentous change, it is Mr. Lecky’s object to show, is due to that concurrence of conditions which he has chosen to call “the advance of the Spirit of Rationalism.”</p><p>In other parts of his work, where he attempts to trace the action of the same conditions on the acceptance of miracles and on other chief phases of our historical development, Mr. Lecky has laid himself open to considerable criticism. The chapters on the “Miracles of the Church,” the æsthetic, scientific, and moral development of Rationalism, the Secularization of Politics, and the Industrial History of Rationalism, embrace a wide range of diligently gathered facts; but they are nowhere illuminated by a sufficiently clear conception and statement of the agencies at work, or the mode of their action, in the gradual modification of opinion and of life. The writer frequently impresses us as being in a state of hesitation concerning his own standing-point, which may form a desirable stage in private meditation but not in published exposition. Certain epochs in theoretic conception, certain considerations, which should be fundamental to his survey, are introduced quite incidentally in a sentence or two, or in a note which seems to be an afterthought. Great writers and their ideas are touched upon too slightly and with too little discrimination, and important theories are sometimes characterized with a rashness which conscientious revision will correct. There is a fatiguing use of vague or shifting phrases, such as “modern civilization,” “spirit of the age,” “tone of thought,” “intellectual type of the age,” “bias of the imagination,” “habits of religious thought,” unbalanced by any precise definition; and the spirit of rationalism is sometimes treated of as if it lay outside the specific mental activities of which it is a generalized expression. Mr. Curdle’s famous definition of the dramatic unities as “a sort of a general oneness,” is not totally false; but such luminousness as it has could only be perceived by those who already knew what the unities were. Mr. Lecky has the advantage of being strongly impressed with the great part played by the emotions in the formation of opinion, and with the high complexity of the causes at work in social evolution; but he frequently writes as if he had never yet distinguished between the complexity of the conditions that produce prevalent states of mind and the inability of particular minds to give distinct reasons for the preferences or persuasions produced by those states. In brief, he does not discriminate, or does not help his reader to discriminate, between objective complexity and subjective confusion. But the most muddle-headed gentleman who represents the spirit of the age by observing, as he settles his collar, that the development theory is quite “the thing” is a result of definite processes, if we could only trace them. “Mental attitudes,” and “predispositions,” however vague in consciousness, have not vague causes, any more than the “blind motions of the spring” in plants and animals. </p><p>The word “Rationalism” has the misfortune, shared by most words in this gray world, of being somewhat equivocal. This evil may be nearly overcome by careful preliminary definition; but Mr. Lecky does not supply this, and the original specific application of the word to a particular phase of biblical interpretation seems to have clung about his use of it with a misleading effect. Through some parts of his book he appears to regard the grand characteristic of modern thought and civilization, compared with ancient, as a radiation in the first instance from a change in religious conceptions. The supremely important fact, that the gradual reduction of all phenomena within the sphere of established law, which carries as a consequence the rejection of the miraculous, has its determining current in the development of physical science, seems to have engaged comparatively little of his attention; at least, he gives it no prominence. The great conception of universal regular sequence, without partiality and without caprice—the conception which is the most potent force at work in the modification of our faith, and of the practical form given to our sentiments—could only grow out of that patient watching of external fact, and that silencing of preconceived notions, which are urged upon the mind by the problems of physical science.</p><p>There is not room here to explain and justify the impressions of dissatisfaction which have been briefly indicated, but a serious writer like Mr. Lecky will not find such suggestions altogether useless. The objections, even the misunderstandings, of a reader who is not careless or ill-disposed, may serve to stimulate an author’s vigilance over his thoughts as well as his style. It would be gratifying to see some future proof that Mr. Lecky has acquired juster views than are implied in the assertion that philosophers of the sensational school “can never rise to the conception of the disinterested;” and that he has freed himself from all temptation to that mingled laxity of statement and ill-pitched elevation of tone which are painfully present in the closing pages of his second volume. </p><p>ADDRESS TO WORKING MEN, BY FELIX HOLT. </p><p>Fellow-Workmen: I am not going to take up your time by complimenting you. It has been the fashion to compliment kings and other authorities when they have come into power, and to tell them that, under their wise and beneficent rule, happiness would certainly overflow the land. But the end has not always corresponded to that beginning. If it were true that we who work for wages had more of the wisdom and virtue necessary to the right use of power than has been shown by the aristocratic and mercantile classes, we should not glory much in that fact, or consider that it carried with it any near approach to infallibility. </p><p>In my opinion, there has been too much complimenting of that sort; and whenever a speaker, whether he is one of ourselves or not, wastes our time in boasting or flattery, I say, let us hiss him. If we have the beginning of wisdom, which is, to know a little truth about ourselves, we know that as a body we are neither very wise nor very virtuous. And to prove this, I will not point specially to our own habits and doings, but to the general state of the country. Any nation that had within it a majority of men and we are the majority possessed of much wisdom and </p><p>virtue, would not tolerate the bad practices, the commercial lying and swindling, the poisonous adulteration of goods, the retail cheating, and the political bribery which are carried on boldly in the midst of us. A majority has the power of creating a public opinion. We could groan and hiss before we had the franchise: if we had groaned and hissed in the right place, if we had discerned better between good and evil, if the multitude of us artisans, and factory hands, and miners, and laborers of all sorts, had been skilful, faithful, well-judging, industrious, </p><p>sober and I don t see how there can be wisdom and virtue anywhere without these qualities we should have made an audience that would have shamed the other classes out of their share in the national vices. We should have had better members of Parliament, better religious teachers, honester tradesmen, fewer foolish demagogues, less impudence in infamous and brutal men; and we should not have had among us the abomination of men calling themselves religious while living in splendor on ill-gotten gains. I say, it is not possible for any society in which there is a</p><p>very large body of wise and virtuous men to be as vicious as our society is to have as low a standard of right and wrong, to have so much belief in falsehood, or to have so degrading, barbarous a notion of what pleasure is, or of what justly raises a man above his fellows. Therefore, let us have none with this nonsense about our being much better than the rest of our countrymen, or the pretence that that was a reason why we ought to have such an extension of the franchise as has been given to us. The reason for our having the franchise, as I want presently to show, lies somewhere else than in our personal good qualities, and does not in the least lie in any high betting chance that a delegate is a better man than a duke, or that a Sheffield grinder is a better man than any one of the firm he works for. </p><p>However, we have got our franchise now. We have been sarcastically called in the House of Commons the future masters of the country; and if that sarcasm contains any truth, it seems to me that the first thing we had better think of is, our heavy responsibility; that is to say, the terrible risk we run of working mischief and missing good, as others have done before us. Suppose certain men, discontented with the irrigation of a country which depended for all its prosperity on the right direction being given to the waters of a great river, had got the management of the irrigation before they were quite sure how exactly it could be altered for the better, or whether they could command the necessary agency for such on alteration. Those men would have a difficult and dangerous business on their hands; and the more sense, feeling, and knowledge they had, the more they would be likely to tremble rather than to triumph. Our situation is not altogether unlike theirs. For general prosperity and well-being is a vast crop, that like the corn in Egypt can be come at, not at all by hurried snatching, but only by a well-judged patient process; and whether our political power will be any good to us now we have got it, must depend entirely on the means and materials the knowledge, ability, and honesty we have at command. These three things are the only conditions on which we can get any lasting benefit, as every clever workman among us knows: he knows that for an article to be worth </p><p>much there must be a good invention or plan to go upon, there must be a well-prepared material, and there must be skilful and honest work in carrying out the plan. And by this test we may try those who want to be our leaders. Have they anything to offer us besides indignant talk? When they tell us we ought to have this, that, or the other thing, can they explain to us any reasonable, fair, safe way of getting it? Can they argue in favor of a particular change by showing us pretty closely how the change is likely to work? I don t want to decry a just indignation; on the contrary, I should like it to be more thorough and general. A wise man, more than two thousand years ago, when he was asked what would most tend to lessen injustice in the world, said,  If every bystander felt as indignant at a wrong as if he himself were the sufferer.  Let us cherish such indignation. But the long-growing evils of a great nation are a tangled business, asking for a good deal more than indignation in order to be got rid of. Indignation is a fine war-horse, but the war-horse must be ridden by a man: it must be ridden by rationality, skill, courage, armed with the right weapons, and taking definite aim.</p><p>We have reason to be discontented with many things, and, looking back either through the history of England to much earlier generations or to the legislation and administrations of later times, we are justified in saying that many of the evils under which our country now suffers are the consequences of folly, ignorance, neglect, or self-seeking in those who, at different times have wielded the powers of rank, office, and money. But the more bitterly we feel this, the more loudly we utter it, the stronger is the obligation we lay on ourselves to beware, lest we also, by a too hasty wresting of measures which seem to promise an immediate partial relief, make a worse time of it for our own generation, and leave a bad inheritance to our children. The deepest curse of wrong-doing, whether of the foolish or wicked sort, is that its effects are difficult to be undone. I suppose there is hardly anything more to be shuddered at than that part of the history of disease which shows how, when a man injures his constitution by a life of vicious excess, his children and grandchildren inherit diseased bodies and minds, and how the effects of that unhappy inheritance continue to spread beyond our calculation. This is only one example of the law by which human lives are linked together; another example of what we complain of when we point to our pauperism, to the brutal ignorance of multitudes among our fellow countrymen, to the weight of taxation laid on us by blamable wars, to the wasteful channels made for the public money, to the expense and trouble of getting justice, and call these the effects of bad rule. This is the law that we all bear the yoke of, the law of no man s making, and which no man can undo. Everybody now sees an example of it in the case of Ireland. We who are living now are sufferers by the wrong-doing of those who lived before us; we are the sufferers by each other s wrong-doing; and the children who come after us are and will be sufferers from the same causes. Will any man say he doesn t care for that law it is nothing to him what he wants is to better himself? With what face then will he complain of any injury? If he says that in politics or in any sort of social action he will not care to know what are likely to be the consequences to others besides himself, he is defending the very worst doings that have brought about his discontent. He might as well say that there is no better rule needful for men than that each should tug and drive for what will please him, without caring how that tugging will act on the fine widespread network of society in which he is fast meshed. If any man taught that as a doctrine, we should know him for a fool. But there are men who act upon it; every scoundrel, for example, whether he is a rich religious scoundrel who lies and cheats on a large scale, and will perhaps come and ask you to send him to Parliament, or a poor pocket-picking scoundrel, who will steal your loose pence while you are listening round the</p><p>platform. None of us are so ignorant as not to know that a society, a nation is held together by just the opposite doctrine and action by the dependence of men on each other and the sense they have of a common interest in preventing injury. And we working men are, I think, of all classes the last that can afford to forget this; for if we did we should be much like sailors cutting away the timbers of our own ship to warm our grog with. For what else is the meaning of our trades-unions? What else is the meaning of every flag we carry, every procession we make, every crowd we collect for the sake of making some protest on behalf of our body as receivers of wages, if not this: that it is our interest to stand by each other, and that this being the common interest, no one of us will try to make a good bargain for himself without considering what will be good for his fellows? And every member of a union believes that the wider he can spread his union, the stronger and surer will be the effect of it. So I think I shall be borne out in saying that a working man who can put two and two together, or take three from four and see what will be the remainder, can understand that a society, to be well off, must be made up chiefly of men who consider the general good as well as their own. </p><p>Well, but taking the world as it is and this is one way we must take it when we want to find out how it can be improved no society is made up of a single class: society stands before us like that wonderful piece of life, the human body, with all its various parts depending on one another, and with a terrible liability to get wrong because of that delicate dependence. We all know how many diseases the human body is apt to suffer from, and how difficult it is even for the doctors to find out exactly where the seat or beginning of the disorder is. That is because the body is made up of so many various parts, all related to each other, or likely all to feel the effect if any one of them goes wrong. It is somewhat the same with our old nations or societies. No society ever stood long in the world without getting to be composed of different classes. Now, it is all pretence to say that there is no such thing as class interest. It is clear that if any particular number of men get a particular benefit from any existing institution, they are likely to band together, in order to keep up that benefit and increase it, until it is perceived to be unfair and injurious to another large number, who get knowledge and strength enough to set up a resistance. And this, again, has been part of the history of every great society since history began. But the simple reason for this being, that any large body of men is likely to have more of stupidity, narrowness, and greed than of farsightedness and generosity, it is plain that the number who resist unfairness and injury are in danger of becoming injurious in their turn. And in this way a justifiable resistance has become a damaging convulsion, making everything worse instead of better. This has been seen so often that we ought to profit a little by the experience. So long as there is selfishness in men; so long as they have not found out for themselves institutions which express and carry into practice the truth, that the highest interest of mankind must at last be a common and not a divided interest; so long as the gradual operation of steady causes has not made that truth a part of every man s knowledge and feeling, just as we now not only know that it is good for our health to be cleanly, but feel that cleanliness is only another word for comfort, which is the under-side or lining of all pleasure; so long, I say as men wink at their own knowingness, or hold their heads high because they have got an advantage over their fellows; so long class interest will be in danger of making itself felt injuriously. No set of men will get any sort of power</p><p>without being in danger of wanting more than their right share. But, on the other hand, it is just as certain that no set of men will get angry at having less than their right share, and set up a claim on that ground, without falling into just the same danger of exacting too much, and exacting it in wrong ways. It s human nature we have got to work with all round, and nothing else. That seems like saying something very commonplace nay, obvious; as if one should say that where there are hands there are mouths. Yet, to hear a good deal of the speechifying and to see a good deal of the action that go forward, one might suppose it was forgotten. </p><p>But I come back to this: that, in our old society, there are old institutions, and among them the various distinctions and inherited advantages of classes, which have shaped themselves along with all the wonderful slow-growing system of things made up of our laws, our commerce, and our stores of all sorts, whether in material objects, such as buildings and machinery, or in knowledge, such as scientific thought and professional skill. Just as in that case I spoke of before, the irrigation of a country, which must absolutely have its water distributed or it will bear no crop; there are the old channels, the old banks, and the old pumps, which must be used as they are until new and better have been prepared, or the structure of the old has been gradually altered. But it would be fool s work to batter down a pump only because a better might be made, when you had no machinery ready for a new one: it would be wicked work, if villages lost their crops by it. Now the only safe way by which society can be steadily improved and our worst evils reduced, is not by any attempt to do away directly with the actually existing class distinctions and advantages, as if everybody could have the same sort of work, or lead the same sort of life (which none of my hearers are stupid enough to suppose), but by the turning of class interests into class functions or duties. What I mean is, that each class should be urged by the surrounding conditions to perform its particular work under the strong pressure of responsibility to the nation at large; that our public affairs should be got into a state in which there should be no impunity for foolish or faithless conduct. In this way the public judgment would sift out incapability and dishonesty from posts of high charge, and even personal ambition would necessarily become of a worthier sort, since the desires of the most selfish men must be a good deal shaped by the opinions of those around them; and for one person to put on a cap and bells, or to go about dishonest or paltry ways of getting rich that he may spend a vast sum of money in having more finery than his neighbors, he must be pretty sure of a crowd who will applaud him. Now, changes can only be good in proportion as they help to bring about this sort of result: in proportion as they put knowledge in the place of ignorance, and fellow-feeling in the place of selfishness. In the course of that substitution class distinctions must inevitably change their character, and represent the varying duties of men, not their varying interests. But this end will not come by impatience.  Day will not break the sooner because we get up before the twilight.  Still less will it come by mere undoing, or change merely as change. And moreover, if we believed that it would be unconditionally hastened by our getting the franchise, we should be what I call superstitious men, believing in magic, or the production of a result by hocus-pocus. Our getting the franchise will greatly hasten that good end in proportion only as every one of us has the knowledge, the foresight, the conscience, that will make him well-judging and scrupulous in the use of it. The nature of things in</p><p>this world has been determined for us beforehand, and in such a way that no ship can be expected to sail well on a difficult voyage, and reach the right port, unless it is well manned: the nature of the winds and the waves, of the timbers, the sails, and the cordage, will not accommodate itself to drunken, mutinous sailors. </p><p>You will not suspect me of wanting to preach any cant to you, or of joining in the pretence that everything is in a fine way, and need not be made better. What I am striving to keep in our minds is the care, the precaution, with which we should go about making things better, so that the public order may not be destroyed, so that no fatal shock may be given to this society of ours, this living body in which our lives are bound up. After the Reform Bill of 1832 I was in an election riot, which showed me clearly, on a small scale, what public disorder must always be; and I have never forgotten that the riot was brought about chiefly by the agency of dishonest men who professed to be on the people s side. Now, the danger hanging over change is great, just in proportion as it tends to produce such disorder by giving any large number of ignorant men, whose notions of what is good are of a low and brutal sort, the belief that they have got power into their hands, and may do pretty much as they like. If any one can look round us and say that he sees no signs of any such danger now, and that our national condition is running along like a clear broadening stream, safe not to get choked with mud, I call him a cheerful man: perhaps he does his own gardening, and seldom taken exercise far away from home. To us who have no gardens, and often walk abroad, it is plain that we can never get into a bit of a crowd but we must rub clothes with a set of roughs, who have the worst vices of the worst rich who are gamblers, sots, libertines, knaves, or else mere sensual simpletons and victims. They are the ugly crop that has sprung up while the stewards have been sleeping; they are the multiplying brood begotten by parents who have been left without all teaching save that of a too craving body, without all well-being save the fading delusions of drugged beer and gin. They are the hideous margin of society, at one edge drawing toward it the undesigning ignorant poor, at the other darkening imperceptibly into the lowest criminal class. Here is one of the evils which cannot be got rid of quickly, and against which any of us who have got sense, decency, and instruction have need to watch. That these degraded fellow-men could really get the mastery in a persistent disobedience to the laws and in a struggle to subvert order, I do not believe; but wretched calamities must come from the very beginning of such a struggle, and the continuance of it would be a civil war, in which the inspiration on both sides might soon cease to be even a false notion of good, and might become the direct savage impulse of ferocity. We have all to see to it that we do not help to rouse what I may call the savage beast in the breasts of our generation that we do not help to poison the nation s blood, and make richer provision for bestiality to come. We know well enough that oppressors have sinned in this way that oppression has notoriously made men mad; and we are determined to resist oppression. But let us, if possible, show that we can keep sane in our resistance, and shape our means more and more reasonably toward the least harmful, and therefore the speediest, attainment of our end. Let us, I say, show that our spirits are too strong to be driven mad, but can keep that sober determination which alone gives mastery over the adaptation of means. And a first guarantee of this sanity will be to act as if we understood that the fundamental duty of a government is to preserve order, to enforce obedience of the laws. It has been held hitherto that a man can be depended on as a guardian of order only when he has much money and comfort to lose. But a better state of things would be, that men who had little money and not much comfort should still be guardians of order, because they had sense to see that disorder would do no good, and had a heart of justice, pity, and fortitude, to keep them from making more misery only because they felt some misery themselves. There are thousands of artisans who have already shown this fine spirit, and have endured much with patient heroism. If such a spirit spread, and penetrated us all, we should soon become the masters of the country in the best sense and to the best ends. For, the public order being preserved, there can be no government in future that will not be determined by our insistance on our fair and practicable demands. It is only by disorder that our demands will be choked, that we shall find ourselves lost among a brutal rabble, with all the intelligence of the country opposed to us, and see government in the shape of guns that will sweep us down in the ignoble martyrdom of fools.</p><p>It has been a too common notion that to insist much on the preservation of order is the part of a selfish aristocracy and a selfish commercial class, because among these, in the nature of things, have been found the opponents of change. I am a Radical; and, what is more, I am not a Radical with a title, or a French cook, or even an entrance into fine society. I expect great changes, and I desire them. But I don t expect them to come in a hurry, by mere inconsiderate sweeping. A Hercules with a big besom is a fine thing for a filthy stable, but not for weeding a seed-bed, where his besom would soon make a barren floor. </p><p>That is old-fashioned talk, some one may say. We know all that. </p><p>Yes, when things are put in an extreme way, most people think they know them; but, after all, they are comparatively few who see the small degrees by which those extremes are arrived at, or have the resolution and self-control to resist the little impulses by which they creep on surely toward a fatal end. Does anybody set out meaning to ruin himself, or to drink himself to death, or to waste his life so that he becomes a despicable old man, a superannuated nuisance, like a fly in winter. Yet there are plenty, of whose lot this is the pitiable story. Well now, </p><p>supposing us all to have the best intentions, we working men, as a body, run some risk of bringing evil on the nation in that unconscious manner half hurrying, half pushed in a jostling march toward an end we are not thinking of. For just as there are many things which we know better and feel much more strongly than the richer, softer-handed classes can know or feel them; so there are many things many precious benefits which we, by the very fact of our privations, our lack of leisure and instruction, are not so likely to be aware of and take into our account. Those precious benefits form a chief part of what I may call the common estate of society: a wealth over and above buildings, machinery, produce, shipping, and so on, though closely connected with these; a wealth of a more delicate kind, that we may more unconsciously bring into danger, doing harm and not knowing that we do it. I mean that treasure of knowledge, science, poetry, refinement of thought, feeling, and manners, great memories and the interpretation of great records, which is carried on from the minds of one generation to the minds of another. This is something distinct from the indulgences of luxury and the pursuit of vain finery; and one of the hardships in the lot of working men is that they have been for the most part shut out from sharing in this treasure. It can make a man s life very great, very full of delight, though he has no smart furniture and no horses: it also yields a great deal of discovery that corrects error, and of invention that lessens bodily pain, and must at least make life easier for all.</p><p>Now the security of this treasure demands, not only the preservation of order, but a certain patience on our part with many institutions and facts of various kinds, especially touching the accumulation of wealth, which from the light we stand in, we are more likely to discern the evil than the good of. It is constantly the task of practical wisdom not to say,  This is good, and I will have it,  but to say,  This is the less of two unavoidable evils, and I will bear it.  And this treasure of knowledge, which consists in the fine activity, the exalted vision of</p><p>many minds, is bound up at present with conditions which have much evil in them. Just as in the case of material wealth and its distribution we are obliged to take the selfishness and weaknesses of human nature into account, and however we insist that men might act better, are forced, unless we are fanatical simpletons, to consider how they are likely to act; so in this matter of the wealth that is carried in men s minds, we have to reflect that the too absolute predominance of a class whose wants have been of a common sort, who are chiefly struggling to get better and more food, clothing, shelter, and bodily recreation, may lead to hasty measures for the sake of having things more fairly shared, which, even if they did not fail of their object, would at last debase the life of the nation. Do anything which will throw the classes who hold the treasures of knowledge nay, I may say, the treasure of refined needs into the </p><p>background, cause them to withdraw from public affairs, stop too suddenly any of the sources by which their leisure and ease are furnished, rob them of the chances by which they may be influential and pre-eminent, and you do something as short-sighted as the acts of France and Spain when in jealousy and wrath, not altogether unprovoked, they drove from among them races and classes that held the traditions of handicraft and agriculture. You injure your own inheritance and the inheritance of your children. You may truly say that this which I call the common estate of society has been anything but common to you; but the same may be said, by many of us, of the sunlight and the air, of the sky and the fields, of parks and holiday games. Nevertheless that these blessings exist makes life worthier to us, and urges us the more to energetic, likely means of getting our share in them; and I say, let us watch carefully, lest we do anything to lessen this treasure which is held in the minds of men, while we exert ourselves, first of all, and to the very utmost, that we and our children may share in all its benefits. Yes; exert ourselves to the utmost, to break the yoke of ignorance. If we demand more leisure, more ease in our lives, let us show that we don t deserve the reproach of wanting to shirk that industry which, in some form or other, every man, whether rich or poor, should feel himself as much bound to as he is bound to decency. Let us show that we want to have some time and strength left to us, that we may use it, not for brutal indulgence, but for the rational exercise of the faculties which make us men. Without this no political measures can benefit us. No political institution will alter the nature of Ignorance, or hinder it from producing vice and misery. Let Ignorance start how it will, it must run the same round of low appetites, poverty, slavery, and superstition. Some of us know this well nay, I will say, feel it; for knowledge of this kind cuts deep; and to us it is one of the most painful facts belonging to our condition that there are numbers of our fellow-workmen who are so far from feeling in the same way, that they never use the imperfect opportunities already offered them for giving their children some schooling, but turn their little ones of tender age into bread-winners, often at cruel tasks, exposed to the horrible infection of childish vice. Of course, the causes of these hideous things go a long way back. Parents  misery has made parents  wickedness. But we, who are still blessed with the hearts of fathers and the consciences of men we who have some knowledge of the curse entailed on broods of creatures in human shape, whose enfeebled bodies and dull perverted minds are mere centres of uneasiness in whom even appetite is feeble and joy impossible I say we are bound to use all the means at our command to help in putting a stop to this horror. Here, it seems to me, is a way in which we may use extended co-operation among</p><p>us to the most momentous of all purposes, and make conditions of enrolment that would strengthen all educational measures. It is true enough that there is a low sense of parental duties in the nation at large, and that numbers who have no excuse in bodily hardship seem to think it a light thing to beget children, to bring human beings with all their tremendous possibilities into this difficult world, and then take little heed how they are disciplined and furnished for the perilous journey they are sent on without any asking of their own. This is a sin shared in more or less by all classes; but there are sins which, like taxation, fall the heaviest on the poorest, and none have such galling reasons as we working men to try and rouse to the utmost the feeling of responsibility in fathers and mothers. We have been urged into co-operation by the pressure of common demands. In war men need each other more; and where a given point has to be defended, fighters inevitably find themselves shoulder to shoulder. So fellowship grows, so grow the rules of fellowship, which gradually shape themselves to thoroughness as the idea of a common good becomes more complete. We feel a right to say, If you will be one of us, you must make such and such a contribution you must renounce such and such a separate advantage you must set your face against such and such an infringement. If we have any false ideas about our common good, our rules will be wrong, and we shall be co-operating to damage each other. But, now, here is a part of our good, without which everything else we strive for will be worthless I mean the rescue of our children. Let us demand from the members of our unions that they fulfil their duty as parents in this definite matter, which rules can reach. Let us demand that they send their children to school, so as not to go on recklessly, breeding a moral pestilence among us, just as strictly as we demand that they pay their contributions to a common fund, understood to be for a common benefit. While we watch our public men, let us watch one another as to this duty, which is also public, and more momentous even than obedience to sanitary regulations. While we resolutely declare against the wickedness in high places, let us set ourselves also against the wickedness in low places, not quarrelling which came first, or which is the worse of the two not trying to settle the miserable precedence of plague or famine, but insisting unflinchingly on remedies once ascertained, and summoning those who hold the treasure of knowledge to remember that they hold it in trust, and that with them lies the task of searching for new remedies, and finding the right methods of applying them. </p><p>To find right remedies and right methods. Here is the great function of knowledge: here the life of one man may make a fresh era straight away, in which a sort of suffering that has existed shall exist no more. For the thousands of years down to the middle of the sixteenth century that human limbs had been hacked and amputated, nobody knew how to stop the bleeding except by searing the ends of the vessels with red-hot iron. But then came a man named Ambrose Par , and said,  Tie up the arteries!  That was a fine word to utter. It contained the statement of a method a plan by which a particular evil was forever assuaged. Let us try to discern the men whose words carry that sort of kernel, and choose such men to be our guides and representatives not choose platform swaggerers, who bring us nothing but the ocean to make our broth with.</p><p>To get the chief power into the hands of the wisest, which means to get our life regulated according to the truest principles mankind is in possession of, is a problem as old as the very notion of wisdom. The solution comes slowly, because men collectively can only be made to embrace principles, and to act on them, by the slow stupendous teaching of the world s events. Men will go on planting potatoes, and nothing else but potatoes, till a potato disease comes and forces them to find out the advantage of a varied crop. Selfishness, stupidity, sloth, persist in trying to adapt the world to their desires, till a time comes when the world manifests itself as too decidedly inconvenient to them. Wisdom stands outside of man and urges itself upon him, like the marks of the changing seasons, before it finds a home within him, directs his actions, and from the precious effects of obedience begets a corresponding love.</p><p>But while still outside of us, wisdom often looks terrible, and wears strange forms, wrapped in the changing conditions of a struggling world. It wears now the form of wants and just demands in a great multitude of British men: wants and demands urged into existence by the forces of a maturing world. And it is in virtue of this in virtue of this presence of wisdom on our side as a mighty fact, physical and moral, which must enter into and shape the thoughts and actions of mankind that we working men have obtained the suffrage. Not because we are an excellent multitude, but because we are a needy multitude. </p><p>But now, for our own part, we have seriously to consider this outside wisdom which lies in the supreme unalterable nature of things, and watch to give it a home within us and obey it. If the claims of the unendowed multitude of working men hold within them principles which must shape the future, it is not less true that the endowed classes, in their inheritance from the past, hold the precious material without which no worthy, noble future can be moulded. Many of the highest uses of life are in their keeping; and if privilege has often been abused, it has also been the nurse of excellence. Here again we have to submit ourselves to the great law of inheritance. If we quarrel with the way in which the labors and earnings of the past have been preserved and handed down, we are just as bigoted, just as narrow, just as wanting in that religion which keeps an open ear and an obedient mind to the teachings of fact, as we accuse those of being, who quarrel with the new truths and new needs which are disclosed in the present. The deeper insight we get into the causes of human trouble, and the ways by which men are made better and happier, the less we shall be inclined to the unprofitable spirit and practice of reproaching classes as such in a wholesale fashion. Not all the evils of our condition are such as we can justly blame others for; and, I repeat, many of them are such as no changes of institutions can quickly remedy. To discern between the evils that energy can remove and the evils that patience must bear, makes the difference between manliness and childishness, between good sense and folly. And more than that, without such discernment, seeing that we have grave duties toward our own body and the country at large, we can hardly escape acts of fatal rashness and injustice. </p><p>I am addressing a mixed assembly of workmen, and some of you may be as well or better fitted than I am to take up this office. But they will not think it amiss in me that I have tried to bring together the considerations most likely to be of service to us in preparing ourselves for the use of our new opportunities. I have avoided touching on special questions. The best help toward judging well on these is to approach them in the right temper without vain expectation, and with a resolution which is mixed with temperance.</p></body></text></TEI>
